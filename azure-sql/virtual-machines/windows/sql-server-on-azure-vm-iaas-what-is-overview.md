This article provides an overview of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) on the Windows platform.

If you're new to SQL Server on Azure VMs, check out the *SQL Server on Azure VM Overview* video from our in-depth [Azure SQL video series](/shows/Azure-SQL-for-Beginners?WT.mc_id=azuresql4beg_azuresql-ch9-niner):

## Overview

[SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/) enables you to use full versions of SQL Server in the cloud without having to manage any on-premises hardware. SQL Server virtual machines (VMs) also simplify licensing costs when you pay as you go.

Azure virtual machines run in many different [geographic regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) around the world. They also offer various [machine sizes](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes). The virtual machine image gallery allows you to create a SQL Server VM with the right version, edition, and operating system. This makes virtual machines a good option for many different SQL Server workloads.

## Feature benefits

When you register your SQL Server on Azure VM with the [SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md) you unlock a number of feature benefits. Registering with the extension is completely free.

The following table details the benefits unlocked by the extension:

[!INCLUDE [SQL VM feature benefits](../../includes/sql-vm-feature-benefits.md)]

## Getting started

To get started with SQL Server on Azure VMs, review the following resources:

- **Create SQL VM**: To create your SQL Server on Azure VM, review the Quickstarts using the [Azure portal](sql-vm-create-portal-quickstart.md), [Azure PowerShell](sql-vm-create-powershell-quickstart.md) or an [ARM template](create-sql-vm-resource-manager-template.md). For more thorough guidance, review the [Provisioning guide](create-sql-vm-portal.md).

- **Storage configuration**: For information about configuring storage for your SQL Server on Azure VMs, review [Storage configuration](storage-configuration.md).
- **Performance**: Fine-tune the performance of your SQL Server on Azure VM by reviewing the [Performance best practices checklist](performance-guidelines-best-practices-checklist.md).
- **Pricing**: For information about the pricing structure of your SQL Server on Azure VM, review the [Pricing guidance](pricing-guidance.md).
- **Frequently asked questions**: For commonly asked questions, and scenarios, review the [FAQ](frequently-asked-questions-faq.yml).

## High availability & disaster recovery

On top of the built-in [high availability provided by Azure virtual machines](/azure/virtual-machines/availability), you can also use the high availability and disaster recovery features provided by SQL Server.

To learn more, see the overview of [Always On availability groups](availability-group-overview.md), and [Always On failover cluster instances](failover-cluster-instance-overview.md). For more details, see the [business continuity overview](business-continuity-high-availability-disaster-recovery-hadr-overview.md).

To get started, see the tutorials for [availability groups](availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet.md) or [preparing your VM for a failover cluster instance](failover-cluster-instance-prepare-vm.md).

## Licensing

To get started, choose a SQL Server virtual machine image with your required version, edition, and operating system. The following sections provide direct links to the Azure portal for the SQL Server virtual machine gallery images. Change the licensing model of a pay-per-usage SQL Server VM to use your own license. For more information, see [How to change the licensing model for a SQL Server VM](licensing-model-azure-hybrid-benefit-ahb-change.md).

Azure only maintains one virtual machine image for each supported operating system, version, and edition combination. This means that over time images are refreshed, and older images are removed. For more information, see the **Images** section of the [SQL Server VMs FAQ](./frequently-asked-questions-faq.yml).

> [!TIP]  
> For more information about how to understand pricing for SQL Server images, see [Pricing guidance for SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](pricing-guidance.md).

The following table provides a matrix of pay-as-you-go SQL Server images.

| Version | Operating System | 
| --- | --- | 
| **SQL Server 2022** | [Windows Server 2022](https://portal.azure.com/#create/microsoftsqlserver.sql2022-ws2022enterprise-gen2) | 
| **SQL Server 2019** | [Windows Server 2022](https://portal.azure.com/#create/microsoftsqlserver.sql2019-ws2022enterprise-gen2), [Windows Server 2019](https://portal.azure.com/#create/microsoftsqlserver.sql2019-ws2019enterprise-ARM) |

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlvm](../../includes/virtual-machines-2008-end-of-support.md)]

To see the available SQL Server on Linux virtual machine images, see [Overview of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (Linux)](../linux/sql-server-on-linux-vm-what-is-iaas-overview.md).

It's possible to deploy an older image of SQL Server that isn't available in the Azure portal by using PowerShell. To view all available images by using PowerShell, use the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzVMImageOffer -Location $Location -Publisher 'MicrosoftSQLServer'
  ```

For more information about deploying SQL Server VMs using PowerShell, view [How to provision SQL Server virtual machines with Azure PowerShell](create-sql-vm-powershell.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Older images might be outdated. Remember to apply all SQL Server and Windows updates before using them for production.

## Customer experience improvement program (CEIP)

The Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) is enabled by default. This periodically sends reports to Microsoft to help improve SQL Server. There's no management task required with CEIP unless you want to disable it after provisioning. You can customize or disable the CEIP by connecting to the VM with remote desktop. Then run the **SQL Server Error and Usage Reporting** utility. Follow the instructions to disable reporting. For more information about data collection, see the [SQL Server Privacy Statement](/sql/sql-server/sql-server-privacy).
