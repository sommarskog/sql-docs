# Checklist: Best practices for SQL Server on Azure VMs

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlvm](../../includes/appliesto-sqlvm.md)]

This article provides a quick checklist as a series of best practices and guidelines to optimize performance of your SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs).

For comprehensive details, see the other articles in this series: [VM size](performance-guidelines-best-practices-vm-size.md), [Storage](performance-guidelines-best-practices-storage.md), [Security](security-considerations-best-practices.md), [HADR configuration](hadr-cluster-best-practices.md), [Collect baseline](performance-guidelines-best-practices-collect-baseline.md).

Enable [SQL Assessment for SQL Server on Azure VMs](sql-assessment-for-sql-vm.md) and your SQL Server will be evaluated against known best practices with results  on the [SQL VM management page](manage-sql-vm-portal.md) of the Azure portal.

## Overview

While running SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, continue using the same database performance tuning options that are applicable to SQL Server in on-premises server environments. However, the performance of a relational database in a public cloud depends on many factors, such as the size of a virtual machine, and the configuration of the data disks.

There's typically a trade-off between optimizing for costs and optimizing for performance. This performance best practices series is focused on getting the *best* performance for SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. If your workload is less demanding, you might not require every recommended optimization. Consider your performance needs, costs, and workload patterns as you evaluate these recommendations.

## VM size

The checklist in this section covers the [VM size best practices](performance-guidelines-best-practices-vm-size.md) for SQL Server on Azure VMs.

[!INCLUDE[security best practices](../../includes/virtual-machines-best-practices-security.md)]


## SQL Server features

The following is a quick checklist of best practices for SQL Server configuration settings when running your SQL Server instances in an Azure virtual machine in production:

- Enable [database page compression](/sql/relational-databases/data-compression/data-compression) where appropriate.
- Enable [backup compression](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/backup-compression-sql-server).
- Enable [instant file initialization](/sql/relational-databases/databases/database-instant-file-initialization) for data files.
- Limit [autogrowth](/troubleshoot/sql/admin/considerations-autogrow-autoshrink#considerations-for-autogrow) of the database.
- Disable [autoshrink](/troubleshoot/sql/admin/considerations-autogrow-autoshrink#considerations-for-auto_shrink) of the database.
- Disable autoclose of the database.
- Move all databases to data disks, including [system databases](/sql/relational-databases/databases/move-system-databases).
- Move SQL Server error log and trace file directories to data disks.
- Configure default backup and database file locations.
- Set max [SQL Server memory limit](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/server-memory-server-configuration-options#use-) to leave enough memory for the Operating System. ([Leverage Memory\Available Bytes](/sql/relational-databases/performance-monitor/monitor-memory-usage) to monitor the operating system memory health).
- Enable [lock pages in memory](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-the-lock-pages-in-memory-option-windows).
- Enable [optimize for adhoc workloads](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/optimize-for-ad-hoc-workloads-server-configuration-option) for OLTP heavy environments.
- Evaluate and apply the [latest cumulative updates](/sql/database-engine/install-windows/latest-updates-for-microsoft-sql-server) for the installed versions of SQL Server.
- Enable [Query Store](/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store) on all production SQL Server databases [following best practices](/sql/relational-databases/performance/best-practice-with-the-query-store).
- Enable [automatic tuning](/sql/relational-databases/automatic-tuning/automatic-tuning) on mission critical application databases.
- Ensure that all [tempdb best practices](/sql/relational-databases/databases/tempdb-database#optimizing-tempdb-performance-in-sql-server) are followed.
- [Use the recommended number of files](/troubleshoot/sql/performance/recommendations-reduce-allocation-contention#resolution), using multiple `tempdb` data files starting with one file per core, up to eight files.
- Schedule SQL Server Agent jobs to run [DBCC CHECKDB](/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkdb-transact-sql#a-checking-both-the-current-and-another-database), [index reorganize](/sql/relational-databases/indexes/reorganize-and-rebuild-indexes#reorganize-an-index), [index rebuild](/sql/relational-databases/indexes/reorganize-and-rebuild-indexes#rebuild-an-index), and [update statistics](/sql/t-sql/statements/update-statistics-transact-sql#examples) jobs.
- Monitor and manage the health and size of the SQL Server [transaction log file](/sql/relational-databases/logs/manage-the-size-of-the-transaction-log-file#Recommendations).
- Take advantage of any new [SQL Server features](/sql/sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-ver15) available for the version being used.
- Be aware of the differences in [supported features](/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-version-15) between the editions you're considering deploying.
- [Exclude SQL Server files](/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/security/antivirus-and-sql-server) from antivirus software scanning. This includes data files, log files, and backup files.

## Azure features

The following is a quick checklist of best practices for Azure-specific guidance when running your SQL Server on Azure VM:

- Register with [the SQL IaaS Agent Extension](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md) to unlock a number of [feature benefits](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#feature-benefits).
- Leverage the best [backup and restore strategy](backup-restore.md#decision-matrix) for your SQL Server workload.
- Ensure [Accelerated Networking is enabled](/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli#portal-creation) on the virtual machine.
- Leverage [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/security-center/index) to improve the overall security posture of your virtual machine deployment.
- Leverage [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/security-center/azure-defender), integrated with [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/), for specific [SQL Server VM coverage](/azure/security-center/defender-for-sql-introduction) including vulnerability assessments, and just-in-time access, which reduces the attack service while allowing legitimate users to access virtual machines when necessary. To learn more, see [vulnerability assessments](/azure/security-center/defender-for-sql-on-machines-vulnerability-assessment), [enable vulnerability assessments for SQL Server VMs](/azure/security-center/defender-for-sql-on-machines-vulnerability-assessment) and [just-in-time access](/azure/security-center/just-in-time-explained).
- Leverage [Azure Advisor](/azure/advisor/advisor-overview) to address [performance](/azure/advisor/advisor-performance-recommendations), [cost](/azure/advisor/advisor-cost-recommendations), [reliability](/azure/advisor/advisor-high-availability-recommendations), [operational excellence](/azure/advisor/advisor-operational-excellence-recommendations), and [security recommendations](/azure/advisor/advisor-security-recommendations).
- Leverage [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/vm/monitor-virtual-machine) to collect, analyze, and act on telemetry data from your SQL Server environment. This includes identifying infrastructure issues with [VM insights](/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-overview) and monitoring data with [Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview) for deeper diagnostics.
- Enable [Autoshutdown](/azure/automation/automation-solution-vm-management) for development and test environments.
- Implement a high availability and disaster recovery (HADR) solution that meets  your business continuity SLAs, see the [HADR options](business-continuity-high-availability-disaster-recovery-hadr-overview.md#deployment-architectures) options available for SQL Server on Azure VMs.
- Use the Azure portal (support + troubleshooting) to evaluate [resource health](/azure/service-health/resource-health-overview) and history; submit new support requests when needed.
