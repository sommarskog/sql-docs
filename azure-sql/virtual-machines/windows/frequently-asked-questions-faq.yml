    questions:
      - question: |
          What SQL Server virtual machine gallery images are available? 
        answer: |
             Azure maintains virtual machine images for all supported major releases of SQL Server on all editions for both Windows and Linux. For more information, see the complete list of [Windows VM images](sql-server-on-azure-vm-iaas-what-is-overview.md#licensing) and [Linux VM images](../linux/sql-server-on-linux-vm-what-is-iaas-overview.md#create).
          
      - question: |
          Are existing SQL Server virtual machine gallery images updated?
        answer:    Every two months, SQL Server images in the virtual machine gallery are updated with the latest Windows and Linux updates. For Windows images, this includes any updates that are marked important in Windows Update, including important SQL Server security updates and service packs. For Linux images, this includes the latest system updates. SQL Server cumulative updates are handled differently for Linux and Windows. For Linux, SQL Server cumulative updates are also included in the refresh. But at this time, Windows VMs aren't updated with SQL Server or Windows Server cumulative updates.

      - question: |
          Can SQL Server virtual machine images get removed from the gallery?
        answer: |
             Yes. Azure only maintains one image per major version and edition. For example, when a new SQL Server service pack is released, Azure adds a new image to the gallery for that service pack. The SQL Server image for the previous service pack is immediately removed from the Azure portal. However, it is still available for provisioning from PowerShell for the next three months. After three months, the previous service pack image is no longer available. This removal policy would also apply if a SQL Server version becomes unsupported when it reaches the end of its lifecycle.
                
      - question: |
          Is it possible to deploy an older image of SQL Server that isn't visible in the Azure portal?
        answer: |
             Yes, by using PowerShell. For more information about deploying SQL Server VMs using PowerShell, see [How to provision SQL Server virtual machines with Azure PowerShell](create-sql-vm-powershell.md).
             
      - question: |
          Is it possible to create a generalized Azure Marketplace SQL Server image of my SQL Server VM and use it to deploy VMs?
        answer: |
             Yes, but you must then [register each SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md) to manage your SQL Server VM in the portal, as well as utilize features such as automated patching and automatic backups. When registering with the extension, you will also need to specify the license type for each SQL Server VM.
          
      - question: |
          How do I generalize SQL Server on Azure VM and use it to deploy new VMs?
        answer: |
             You can deploy a Windows Server VM (without SQL Server installed on it) and use the [SQL sysprep](/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-using-sysprep) process to generalize SQL Server on Azure VM (Windows) with the SQL Server installation media. Customers who have [Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-default?rtc=1&activetab=software-assurance-default-pivot%3aprimaryr3) can obtain their installation media from the [Volume Licensing Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx). Customers who don't have Software Assurance can use the setup media from an Azure Marketplace SQL Server VM image that has the desired edition.
          
             Alternatively, use one of the SQL Server images from Azure Marketplace to generalize SQL Server on Azure VM. You must delete the following registry key in the source image before creating your own image. Failure to do so can result in the bloating of the SQL Server setup bootstrap folder and/or SQL IaaS Agent extension in failed state.
          
             Registry Key path:  
             `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\SysPrepExternal\Specialize`
          
             > [!NOTE]
             > SQL Server on Azure VMs, including those deployed from custom generalized images, should be [registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension](./sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md?tabs=azure-cli%252cbash) to meet compliance requirements and to utilize optional features such as automated patching and automatic backups. The extension also allows you to [specify the license type](./licensing-model-azure-hybrid-benefit-ahb-change.md?tabs=azure-portal) for each SQL Server VM.
          
      - question: |
          Can I use my own VHD to deploy a SQL Server VM?
        answer: |
             Yes, but you must then [register each SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md) to manage your SQL Server VM in the portal, as well as utilize features such as automated patching and automatic backups.
          
      - question: |
          Is it possible to set up configurations not shown in the virtual machine gallery (for example Windows 2008 R2 + SQL Server 2012)?
        answer: |
             No. For virtual machine gallery images that include SQL Server, you must select one of the provided images either through the Azure portal or via [PowerShell](create-sql-vm-powershell.md). However, you have the ability to deploy a [supported](/lifecycle/products/?terms=windows%20server) Windows VM and self-install a [supported](/lifecycle/products/?terms=sql%20server) SQL Server version to it. You must then [register your SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md) to manage your SQL Server VM in the Azure portal, as well as utilize features such as automated patching and automatic backups. 

      - question: |
          I can't find the version and edition of SQL Server that I want from the images available on Azure Marketplace. 
        answer: |
             If the version and edition of SQL Server you're looking for isn't available in the **Images** drop-down on Azure Marketplace, deploy a Windows-only Azure virtual machine, and then manually install the version and edition of SQL Server you want. Register your SQL Server VM with the [SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md) if you want to manage your SQL Server VM from the Azure portal. 

      - question: |
          I can't find the version of Windows, such as Azure Edition, among the SQL Server images available on Azure Marketplace.
        answer: |
             If the version of Windows you're looking for isn't available in the SQL Server images found in the **Images** drop-down of Azure Marketplace, deploy a Windows-only Azure virtual machine with the desired edition, and then manually install the version and edition of SQL Server you want. Register your SQL Server VM with the [SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md) if you want to manage your SQL Server VM from the Azure portal. 
 
      - question: |
          Is there a free edition of SQL Server available on Azure Marketplace? 
        answer: |
             Developer and Express editions of SQL Server are available on Azure Marketplace, which doesn't charge you for the SQL Server license. If the Express or Developer edition isn't available for the version of SQL Server you're looking for, deploy a Windows-only Azure virtual machine, and then manually install the version and edition of SQL Server you want. Register your SQL Server VM with the [SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md) if you want to manage your SQL Server VM from the Azure portal.
 

          
  - name: Creation
    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I create an Azure virtual machine with SQL Server?
        answer: |
             The easiest method is to create a virtual machine that includes SQL Server. For a tutorial on signing up for Azure and creating a SQL Server VM from the portal, see [Provision a SQL Server virtual machine in the Azure portal](create-sql-vm-portal.md). You can select a virtual machine image that uses pay-per-second SQL Server licensing, or you can use an image that allows you to bring your own SQL Server license. You also have the option of manually installing SQL Server on a VM with either a freely licensed edition (Developer or Express) or by reusing an on-premises license. Be sure to [register your SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md) to manage your SQL Server VM in the portal, as well as utilize features such as automated patching and automatic backups. If you bring your own license, you must have [License Mobility through Software Assurance on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/license-mobility/). For more information, see [Pricing guidance for SQL Server Azure VMs](pricing-guidance.md).
          
      - question: |
          How can I migrate my on-premises SQL Server database to the cloud?
        answer: |
             First create an Azure virtual machine with a SQL Server instance. Then migrate your on-premises databases to that instance. For data migration strategies, see [Migration guide: SQL Server to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](../../migration-guides/virtual-machines/sql-server-to-sql-on-azure-vm-individual-databases-guide.md).
          
  - name: Licensing
    questions:
      - question: |
          How can I install my licensed copy of SQL Server on an Azure VM?
        answer: |
             There are three ways to do this. If you're an Enterprise Agreement (EA) customer, you can provision one of the [virtual machine images](sql-server-on-azure-vm-iaas-what-is-overview.md#licensing). If you have [Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-default), you can enable the [Azure Hybrid Benefit](licensing-model-azure-hybrid-benefit-ahb-change.md) on an existing pay-as-you-go (PAYG) image. Or you can copy the SQL Server installation media to a Windows Server VM, and then install SQL Server on the VM. Be sure to register your SQL Server VM with the [extension](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md) for features such as portal management, automated backup and automated patching. 
          
          
      - question: |
          Does a customer need SQL Server Client Access Licenses (CALs) to connect to a SQL Server pay-as-you-go image that is running on Azure Virtual Machines?
        answer:    No. Customers need CALs when they use bring-your-own-license and move their SQL Server SA server / CAL VM to Azure VMs. 

      - question: |
          Can I change a VM to use my own SQL Server license if it was created from one of the pay-as-you-go gallery images?
        answer: |
             Yes. You can easily switch a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) gallery image to bring-your-own-license (BYOL) by enabling the [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/faq/).  For more information, see [How to change the licensing model for a SQL Server VM](licensing-model-azure-hybrid-benefit-ahb-change.md). Currently, this facility is only available for public and Azure Government cloud customers.
          
          
      - question: |
          Will switching licensing models require any downtime for SQL Server?
        answer: |
             No. [Changing the licensing model](licensing-model-azure-hybrid-benefit-ahb-change.md) doesn't require any downtime for SQL Server as the change is effective immediately and doesn't require a restart of the VM.  
             
      - question: |
          Is it possible to switch licensing models on a SQL Server VM deployed using classic model?
        answer:    No. Changing licensing models isn't supported on a classic VM. You may migrate your VM to the Azure Resource Manager model and register with the SQL IaaS Agent extension. Once the VM is registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension, licensing model changes are available on the VM.

      - question: |
          Can I use the Azure portal to manage multiple instances on the same VM?
        answer: |
             No. Portal management is a feature provided by the SQL IaaS Agent extension, which relies on the SQL Server IaaS Agent extension. As such, the same limitations apply to the extension as to the extension. The portal can either only manage one default instance, or one named instance, as long as it was configured correctly. For more information on these limitations, see [SQL Server IaaS agent extension](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md). 
          
      - question: |
          Can CSP subscriptions activate the Azure Hybrid Benefit?
        answer: |
             Yes, Azure Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) customers can use the Azure Hybrid Benefit by first deploying a pay-as-you-go VM and then converting it to [bring-your-own-license](licensing-model-azure-hybrid-benefit-ahb-change.md), if they have active Software Assurance.
           
      - question: |
          Do I have to pay to license SQL Server on an Azure VM if it is only being used for standby/failover?
        answer: |
             To have a free passive license for a standby secondary availability group or failover clustered instance, you must meet all of the following criteria as outlined by the [Product Licensing Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products):
          
             1. You have [license mobility](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-license-mobility?activetab=software-assurance-license-mobility-pivot:primaryr2) through [Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-default?activetab=software-assurance-default-pivot%3aprimaryr3). 
             1. The passive SQL Server instance doesn't serve SQL Server data to clients or run active SQL Server workloads. It is only used to synchronize with the primary server and otherwise maintain the passive database in a warm standby state. If it is serving data, such as reports to clients running active SQL Server workloads, or performing any work  other than what is specified in the product terms, it must be a paid licensed SQL Server instance. The following activity is permitted on the secondary instance: database consistency checks or CheckDB, full backups, transaction log backups, and monitoring resource usage data. You may also run the primary and corresponding disaster recovery instance simultaneously for brief periods of disaster recovery testing every 90 days. 
             1. The active SQL Server license is covered by Software Assurance and allows for **one** passive secondary SQL Server instance, with up to the same amount of compute as the licensed active server, only. 
             1. The secondary SQL Server VM utilizes the [Disaster Recovery](business-continuity-high-availability-disaster-recovery-hadr-overview.md#free-dr-replica-in-azure) license in the Azure portal.
             
      - question: |
          What is considered a passive instance?
        answer: |
             The passive SQL Server instance doesn't serve SQL Server data to clients or run active SQL Server workloads. It is only used to synchronize with the primary server and otherwise maintain the passive database in a warm standby state. If it is serving data, such as reports to clients running active SQL Server workloads, or performing any work other than what is specified in the product terms, it must be a paid licensed SQL Server instance. The following activity is permitted on the secondary instance: database consistency checks or CheckDB, full backups, transaction log backups, and monitoring resource usage data. You may also run the primary and corresponding disaster recovery instance simultaneously for brief periods of disaster recovery testing every 90 days.
             
          
      - question: |
          What scenarios can utilize the Disaster Recovery (DR) benefit?
        answer: |
             The [licensing guide](https://aka.ms/sql2019licenseguide) provides scenarios in which the Disaster Recovery Benefit can be utilized. Refer to your Product Terms and talk to your licensing contacts or account manager for more information.
          
      - question: |
          Which subscriptions support the Disaster Recovery (DR) benefit?
        answer: |
             Comprehensive programs that offer Software Assurance equivalent subscription rights as a fixed benefit support the DR benefit. This includes. but isn't limited to, the Open Value (OV), Open Value Subscription (OVS), Enterprise Agreement (EA), Enterprise Agreement Subscription (EAS), and the Server and Cloud Enrollment (SCE). Refer to the [product terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products) and talk to your licensing contacts or account manager for more information. 
          
         
  - name: Administration
    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I install a second instance of SQL Server on the same VM? Can I change installed features of the default instance?
        answer: |
             Yes. The SQL Server installation media is located in a folder on the **C** drive. Run **Setup.exe** from that location to add new SQL Server instances or to change other installed features of SQL Server on the machine. Some features, such as Automated Backup, Automated Patching, and Azure Key Vault Integration, only operate against the default instance, or a named instance that was configured properly (See Question 3). Customers using [Software Assurance through the Azure Hybrid Benefit](licensing-model-azure-hybrid-benefit-ahb-change.md) or the **pay-as-you-go** licensing model can install multiple instances of SQL Server on the virtual machine without incurring extra licensing costs. Additional SQL Server instances may strain system resources unless configured correctly. 
          
      - question: |
          What is the maximum number of instances on a VM?
        answer: |
             SQL Server 2012 to SQL Server 2019 can support [50 instances](/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-version-15#RDBMSSP) on a stand-alone server. This is the same limit regardless of in Azure on-premises. See [best practices](./performance-guidelines-best-practices-checklist.md) to learn how to better prepare your environment. 
      
      - question: |
          Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installed with SQL Server is flagged as end of life or obsolete
        answer: |
             When you provision SQL Server on Azure VM, the SQL Server setup program installs a Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable, which is required for SQL Server components to run properly. Your security software may send alerts about end of life (EOL) or obsolete software components due to the version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable components that were installed by SQL Server, particularly for older versions of SQL Server (SQL Server 2016 and earlier). According to the support lifecycle policy, Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable components are supported [as long as the product that installed them is supported](/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/install/windows/visual-c-redistributable-installed-sql-server-flagged-end-of-life-obsolete). As long as your installed version of SQL Server is still supported, you can safely ignore this warning. We recommend not removing VC++ as it may break some SQL Server functionality.

      - question: |
          Can I uninstall the default instance of SQL Server?
        answer: |
             Yes, but there are some considerations. First, SQL Server-associated billing may continue to occur depending on the license model for the VM. Second, as stated in the previous answer, there are features that rely on the [SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md). If you uninstall the default instance without removing the IaaS extension also, the extension continues to look for the default instance and may generate event log errors. These errors are from the following two sources: **Microsoft SQL Server Credential Management** and **Microsoft SQL Server IaaS Agent**. One of the errors might be similar to the following:
          
                A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server wasn't found or wasn't accessible.
          
             If you do decide to uninstall the default instance, also uninstall the [SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md) as well. 
          
      - question: |
          Can I use a named instance of SQL Server with the IaaS extension?
        answer: |
             Yes, if the named instance is the only instance on the SQL Server, and if the original default instance was [uninstalled properly](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#named-instance-support). If there is no default instance, and there are multiple named instances on a single SQL Server VM, the SQL Server IaaS agent extension fails to install.  
          
      - question: |
          Can I remove SQL Server and the associated license billing from a SQL Server VM?
        answer: |
             Yes, but you'll need to take additional steps to avoid being charged for your SQL Server instance as described in [Pricing guidance](pricing-guidance.md). If you want to completely remove the SQL Server instance, you can migrate to another Azure VM without SQL Server preinstalled on the VM and delete the current SQL Server VM. If you want to keep the VM but stop SQL Server billing, follow these steps: 
          
             1. Back up all of your data, including system databases, if necessary. 
             1. Uninstall SQL Server completely, including the SQL IaaS Agent extension (if present).
             1. Install the free [SQL Express edition](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
             1. Register with the SQL IaaS Agent extension. 
             1. [Change the edition of SQL Server](change-sql-server-edition.md#change-edition-property-for-billing) in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to Express to stop billing.  
             1. (optional) Disable the Express SQL Server service by disabling service startup. 
          
      - question: |
          Can I use the Azure portal to manage multiple instances on the same VM?
        answer: |
             No. Portal management is provided by the SQL IaaS Agent extension, which relies on the SQL Server IaaS Agent extension. As such, the same limitations apply to the portal as the extension. The portal can either only manage one default instance, or one named instance as long as it's configured correctly. For more information, see [SQL Server IaaS Agent extension](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md) 
      
      - question: |
          Is Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) supported with SQL Server on Azure VMs? 
        answer: |
             No. Using Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) isn't currently supported with SQL Server on Azure VMs. Use an Active Directory domain account instead. 
          
  - name: Updating and patching
    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I change to a different version/edition of SQL Server in an Azure VM?
        answer: |
             Customers can change their version/edition of SQL Server by using setup media that contains their desired version or edition of SQL Server. Once the edition has been changed, use the Azure portal to modify the edition property of the VM to accurately reflect billing for the VM. For more information, see [change edition of a SQL Server VM](change-sql-server-edition.md). There is no billing difference for different versions of SQL Server, so once the version of SQL Server has been changed, no further action is needed.
          
      - question: |
          How do I get the SQL Server installation media? 
        answer: |             
             For SQL Server VMs deployed through Azure Marketplace, the installation media is at `C:\SQLServerFull`. Run Setup.exe from that location to add new SQL Server instances or to change other installed features of SQL Server on the machine. You can also copy this setup media to other virtual machines to install, or upgrade, that same version and edition of SQL Server.  Customers who have [Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-default?rtc=1&activetab=software-assurance-default-pivot%3aprimaryr3) can obtain their installation media from the [Volume Licensing Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx). 
             
      - question: |
          How are updates and service packs applied on a SQL Server VM?
        answer: |
             Virtual machines give you control over the host machine, including when and how you apply updates. For the operating system, you can manually apply windows updates, or you can enable a scheduling service called [Automated Patching](automated-patching.md). Automated Patching installs any updates that are marked important, including SQL Server updates in that category. Other optional updates to SQL Server must be installed manually.
          
      - question: |
          Can I upgrade my SQL Server instance after registering it with the SQL IaaS Agent extension?
        answer: |
             If the OS is Windows Server 2008 R2 or later, yes. You can use any setup media to upgrade the version and edition of SQL Server, and then you can [register with the SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md#register-with-extension).  Doing so gives you access to all the [benefits](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#feature-benefits) of the SQL IaaS Agent extension such as portal manageability, automated backups, and automated patching. If the OS version is Windows Server 2008, the extension is only supported with limited functionality. 
          
      - question: |
          How can I get free extended security updates for my end of support instances?
        answer: |
             You can get [free extended security updates](sql-server-extend-end-of-support.md) by moving your SQL Server as-is to an Azure virtual machine. Updates are available through the Windows Update channel. For more information, see [end of support options](/sql/sql-server/end-of-support/sql-server-end-of-support-overview).

    questions:
      - question: |
          Are SQL Server failover cluster instances (FCI) supported on Azure VMs?
        answer: |
             Yes. You can configure a [failover cluster instance](failover-cluster-instance-overview.md) using [Azure shared disks](failover-cluster-instance-azure-shared-disks-manually-configure.md), [premium file shares (PFS)](failover-cluster-instance-premium-file-share-manually-configure.md), or [storage spaces direct (S2D)](failover-cluster-instance-storage-spaces-direct-manually-configure.md) for the storage subsystem. Premium file shares provide IOPS and throughput capacities that meet the needs of many workloads. For IO-intensive workloads, consider using storage spaces direct based on managed premium or ultra-disks. Alternatively, you can use third-party clustering or storage solutions as described in [High availability and disaster recovery for SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](business-continuity-high-availability-disaster-recovery-hadr-overview.md#azure-only-high-availability-solutions).
          
             > [!IMPORTANT]
             > SQL Server FCIs registered with the extension don't support features that require the agent, such as automated backup, patching, and advanced portal management. Review [feature benefits](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#feature-benefits) to learn more. 
          
      - question: |
          What is the difference between SQL Server VMs and the SQL Database service?
        answer: |
             Conceptually, running SQL Server on an Azure virtual machine isn't that different from running SQL Server in a remote datacenter. In contrast, [Azure SQL Database](../../database/sql-database-paas-overview.md) offers database-as-a-service. With SQL Database, you don't have access to the machines that host your databases. For a full comparison, see [Choose a cloud SQL Server option: Azure SQL (PaaS) Database or SQL Server on Azure VMs (IaaS)](../../azure-sql-iaas-vs-paas-what-is-overview.md).
          
      - question: |
          How do I install SQL Data tools on my Azure VM?
        answer: |
              Download and install the SQL Data tools from [Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools - Business Intelligence for Visual Studio 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42313).
          
      - question: |
          Are distributed transactions with MSDTC supported on SQL Server VMs?
        answer:     Yes. Local DTC is supported for SQL Server 2016 SP2 and greater. However, applications must be tested when utilizing Always On availability groups, as transactions in-flight during a failover will fail and must be retried. Clustered DTC is available starting with Windows Server 2019. 

      - question: |
          Does Azure SQL virtual machine move or store customer data out of region?
        answer:    No. In fact, Azure SQL virtual machine and the SQL IaaS Agent extension don't store any customer data. Review the [SQL IaaS Agent extension privacy statements](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#in-region-data-residency) to learn more. 
        
      - question: |
          What Azure Load Balancer SKU should be used for a cross-cluster migration of an availability group? 
        answer:    To perform a [cross-cluster migration of an availability group](http://download.microsoft.com/download/d/2/0/d20e1c5f-72ea-4505-9f26-fef9550efd44/alwayson%20ag%20os%20upgrade.docx) on SQL Server on Azure VMs, use the standard [Azure Load Balancer SKU](/azure/load-balancer/skus). 

      - question: |
          Can I use Azure premium file share to host my database files on a standalone instance of SQL Server?  
        answer:    Yes. Azure premium file shares are supported for both failover cluster instances and standalone instances of SQL Server using the [SMB protocol](/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-with-smb-fileshare-as-a-storage-option).

  - name: SQL Server IaaS Agent extension
    questions:
      - question: |
          Should I register my SQL Server VM provisioned from a SQL Server image in Azure Marketplace?
        answer:    No. Microsoft automatically registers VMs provisioned from the SQL Server images in Azure Marketplace. Registering with the extension is required only if the VM was *not* provisioned from the SQL Server images in Azure Marketplace and SQL Server was self-installed.

      - question: |
          Is the SQL IaaS Agent extension available for all customers? 
        answer:    Yes. Customers should register their SQL Server VMs with the extension if they didn't use a SQL Server image from Azure Marketplace and instead self-installed SQL Server, or if they brought their custom VHD. VMs owned by all types of subscriptions (Direct, Enterprise Agreement, and Cloud Solution Provider) can register with the SQL IaaS Agent extension.
       
      - question: |
          What are the prerequisites to register with the SQL IaaS Agent extension?
        answer:    Check the [prerequisites](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md#prerequisites) for details. 
      
      - question: | 
         What Azure permissions are necessary to register with the extension? 
        answer: The client credentials used to register the virtual machine should exist in any of the following Azure roles - **Virtual Machine contributor**, **Contributor**, or **Owner**. 

      - question: |
          Will registering with the SQL IaaS Agent extension install an agent on my VM?
        answer: |
             Not initially. When you first register with the SQL IaaS Agent extension, binaries are copied to the SQL Server VM providing you with limited functionality. Once you enable a feature that relies on it, the SQL IaaS Agent is installed to the VM. Check the [table of benefits](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#feature-benefits) for information about limited functionality. 
                
      - question: | 
           What permissions does the SQL Server IaaS agent extension use? 
        answer: October 2022 introduced the least privilege permissions model for the extension, granting minimal permissions necessary for each feature used by the extension. SQL Server VMs deployed after October 2022 via Azure Marketplace have the least privilege permissions model enabled by default. The extension uses sysadmin rights for SQL Server VMs that were deployed prior to October 2022, or self-installed SQL Server VMs that haven't manually enabled the least privilege model in the Azure portal. Review [SQL IaaS Agent extension permissions](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#permissions-models) to learn more. 

      - question: | 
           Why do I see SQL virtual machines resource in the Azure portal? Who created it? Do I get billed for this?
        answer: The [SQL virtual machines resource](manage-sql-vm-portal.md) is a free resource that allows you to manage your SQL Server VM from the Azure portal. The SQL virtual machines resource is created when you deploy a SQL Server VM image from Azure Marketplace, or manually register a SQL Server VM with the [SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md). Azure can also create this resource automatically for existing VMs if a SQL Server instance is detected. There is no cost associated with SQL virtual machines resource.

      - question: |
          Will registering with the SQL IaaS Agent extension restart SQL Server on my VM?
        answer:   No, starting September 2021, restarting the SQL Server service is no longer required when registering with the [SQL IaaS Agent extension](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md).   
       
      - question: |
          Can I register with the SQL IaaS Agent extension without specifying the SQL Server license type?
        answer:    No. The SQL Server license type isn't an optional property when you're registering with the SQL IaaS Agent extension. You have to set the SQL Server license type as pay-as-you-go or Azure Hybrid Benefit when registering with the SQL IaaS Agent extension. If you have any of the free versions of SQL Server installed, such as Developer or Evaluation edition, you must register with pay-as-you-go licensing. Azure Hybrid Benefit is only available for paid versions of SQL Server such as Enterprise and Standard editions.

      - question: |
          What is the default license type when using the automatic registration feature?
        answer:    The license type automatically defaults to that of the VM image. If you use a pay-as-you-go image for your VM, then your license type is `PAYG`, otherwise your license type is `AHUB` by default. 

      - question: |
          Is it possible to register self-deployed SQL Server VMs with the SQL IaaS Agent extension?
        answer: |
              Yes. If you deployed SQL Server from your own media, and installed the SQL IaaS Agent extension you can register your SQL Server VM with the extension to get the manageability benefits provided by the SQL IaaS Agent extension.    
      - question: |
          Is it possible to repair the SQL IaaS Agent extension? 
        answer: |
              Yes. Navigate to the **SQL virtual machines** resource for your SQL Server VM, and choose **Repair** under **Support & troubleshooting** to open the [repair](sql-agent-extension-troubleshoot-known-issues.md#repair-extension) page and repair the extension. 

      - question: |
          Can I register with the SQL IaaS Agent extension from the Azure portal?
        answer:    No. Registering a single VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension isn't available in the Azure portal. Registering with the SQL IaaS Agent extension is only supported with the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell. 

      - question: |
          Can I register a VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension before SQL Server is installed?
        answer:    No. A VM must have at least one SQL Server (Database Engine) instance to successfully register with the SQL IaaS Agent extension. If there is no SQL Server instance on the VM, the new Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine resource is in a failed state.

      - question: |
          Can I register a VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension if there are multiple SQL Server instances?
        answer:    Yes, provided there is a default instance on the VM. The SQL IaaS Agent extension registers only one SQL Server (Database Engine) instance. The SQL IaaS Agent extension registers the default SQL Server instance in the case of multiple instances.

      - question: |
          Can I register a SQL Server failover cluster instance with the SQL IaaS Agent extension?
        answer:    Yes. SQL Server failover cluster instances on an Azure VM can be registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension with [limited functionality](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#feature-benefits). 

      - question: |
          Can I register my VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension if an Always On availability group is configured?
        answer:    Yes. There are no restrictions to registering a SQL Server instance on an Azure VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension if you're participating in an Always On availability group configuration.

      - question: |
          What is the cost for registering with the SQL IaaS Agent extension?
        answer:    None. There is no fee associated with registering with the SQL IaaS Agent extension. Managing your SQL Server VM with the extension is free. 

      - question: |
          What is the performance impact of using SQL IaaS Agent extension? 
        answer: |
             Once you enable a feature that requires installing the agent, there is minimal impact from the two services that are installed to the OS. These can be monitored via task manager and seen in the built-in Windows Services console. 
          
             The two service names are:
             - `SQLIaaSExtension` (Display name - `Microsoft SQL Server IaaS Agent`)
             - `SqlIaaSExtensionQuery` (Display name - `Microsoft SQL Server IaaS Query Service`)
          
      - question: |
          How do I remove the extension?
        answer: |
             Remove the extension by [unregistering](sql-agent-extension-manually-register-single-vm.md#unregister-from-extension) the SQL Server VM from the SQL IaaS Agent extension. 
      - question: |
          Will registering my VM with the new SQL IaaS Agent extension bring additional costs?
        answer:    No. The SQL IaaS Agent extension just enables additional manageability for SQL Server on Azure VM with no additional charges. 

      - question: |
          Is the SQL IaaS Agent extension available for all customers?
        answer: |
             Yes, as long as the SQL Server VM was deployed on the public cloud using the Resource Manager model, and not the classic model. All other customers are able to register with the new SQL IaaS Agent extension. However, only customers with the [Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-default?activetab=software-assurance-default-pivot%3aprimaryr3) benefit can use their own license by activating the [Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/) on a SQL Server VM. 
          
      - question: |
          What happens to the extension ('Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine') resource if the VM resource is moved or dropped? 
        answer:    When the Microsoft.Compute/VirtualMachine resource is dropped or moved, then the associated Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine resource is notified to asynchronously replicate the operation.

      - question: |
          What happens to the VM if the extension ('Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine') resource is dropped?
        answer:     The Microsoft.Compute/VirtualMachine resource isn't impacted when the Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine resource is dropped. However, the licensing changes default back to the original image source. 
      
      - question: |
          Is the extension necessary to receive Extended Security Updates (ESU)?
        answer: No. [Extended Security Updates (ESU)](/sql/sql-server/end-of-support/sql-server-extended-security-updates) are applied automatically to the VM whether or not your SQL Server VM has registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension. 

      - question: |
          What happened to management modes of the SQL IaaS Agent extension? 
        answer: Management modes were removed from the SQL IaaS Agent extension architecture. Starting in March 2023, registering with the SQL IaaS Agent extension initially just copies the binaries to the SQL Server VM and offers [limited functionality](sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#feature-benefits). Once you enable a feature that relies on it, the SQL IaaS Agent is installed to the SQL Server VM. 

      - question: |
          Can I register my virtual machine image if I'm using Reporting Services, Power BI Report Server, or Analysis Services? 
        answer: No. The SQL IaaS Agent extension isn't supported with the following images - SQL Server Reporting Services, SQL Server Power BI Report Server, SQL Server Analysis Services.
