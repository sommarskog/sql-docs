# Tutorial: Manually configure an availability group - SQL Server on Azure VMs
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlvm](../../includes/appliesto-sqlvm.md)]

[!INCLUDE[tip-for-multi-subnet-ag](../../includes/virtual-machines-ag-listener-multi-subnet.md)]

This tutorial shows how to create an Always On availability group for SQL Server on Azure VMs within a single subnet. The complete tutorial creates an availability group with a database replica on two SQL Server instances.

This article manually configures the availability group environment. It's also possible to automate the steps by using the [Azure portal](availability-group-azure-portal-configure.md), [PowerShell or the Azure CLI](availability-group-az-commandline-configure.md), or [Azure Quickstart Templates](availability-group-quickstart-template-configure.md).

**Time estimate**: This tutorial takes about 30 minutes to complete after you meet the [prerequisites](availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-single-subnet.md).

## Prerequisites

The tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of SQL Server Always On availability groups. If you need more information, see [Overview of Always On availability groups (SQL Server)](/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/overview-of-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server).

Before you begin the procedures in this tutorial, you need to complete [prerequisites for creating Always On availability groups in Azure virtual machines](availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-single-subnet.md). If you completed these prerequisites already, you can jump to [Create the cluster](#create-the-cluster).

The following table summarizes the prerequisites that you need before you can complete this tutorial:

| Requirement |Description |

## <a name="create-the-cluster"></a> Create the cluster

The first task is to create a Windows Server failover cluster with both SQL Server VMs and a witness server:

1. Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to the first SQL Server VM. Use a domain account that's an administrator on both SQL Server VMs and the witness server.

   >[!TIP]
   >In the [prerequisites](availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-single-subnet.md), you created an account called **CORP\Install**. Use this account.

1. On the **Server Manager** dashboard, select **Tools**, and then select **Failover Cluster Manager**.
1. On the left pane, right-click **Failover Cluster Manager**, and then select **Create Cluster**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/40-createcluster.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Failover Cluster Manager and the option for creating a cluster on the shortcut menu.":::

1. In the **Create Cluster Wizard**, create a one-node cluster by stepping through the pages with the settings in the following table:

   | Page | Setting |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Before You Begin** |Use defaults. |
   | **Select Servers** |Enter the first SQL Server VM name in **Enter server name**, and then select **Add**. |
   | **Validation Warning** |Select **No. I do not require support from Microsoft for this cluster, and therefore do not want to run the validation tests. When I select Next, continue Creating the cluster**. |
   | **Access Point for Administering the Cluster** |In **Cluster Name**, enter a cluster name (for example, **SQLAGCluster1**).|
   | **Confirmation** |Use defaults unless you're using Storage Spaces. |

### Set the Windows Server failover cluster's IP address

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows Server 2019, the cluster creates a **Distributed Server Name** value instead of the **Cluster Network Name** value. If you're using Windows Server 2019, skip any steps that refer to the cluster core name in this tutorial. You can create a cluster network name by using [PowerShell](failover-cluster-instance-storage-spaces-direct-manually-configure.md#create-windows-failover-cluster). For more information, review the blog post [Failover Cluster: Cluster Network Object](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/08/14/announcing-windows-server-2019-insider-preview-build-17733/#W0YAxO8BfwBRbkzG.97).

1. In **Failover Cluster Manager**, scroll down to **Cluster Core Resources** and expand the cluster details. Both the **Name** and **IP Address** resources should be in the **Failed** state. 

   The IP address resource can't be brought online because the cluster is assigned the same IP address as the machine itself. It's a duplicate address.

1. Right-click the failed **IP Address** resource, and then select **Properties**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/42-ip-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Failover Cluster Manager that shows selections for opening properties for the IP address." lightbox="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/42-ip-properties.png":::

1. Select **Static IP Address**. Specify an available address from the same subnet as your virtual machines.

1. In the **Cluster Core Resources** section, right-click the cluster name and select **Bring Online**. Wait until both resources are online.

   When the cluster name resource comes online, it updates the domain controller server with a new Active Directory computer account. Use this Active Directory account to run the availability group's clustered service later.

### <a name="addNode"></a> Add the other SQL Server instance to the cluster

1. In the browser tree, right-click the cluster and select **Add Node**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/44-add-node.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Failover Cluster Manager that shows selections for adding a node to a cluster.":::

1. In the **Add Node Wizard**, select **Next**.

1. On the **Select Servers** page, add the second SQL Server VM. Enter the VM name in **Enter server name**, and then select **Add** > **Next**.

1. On the **Validation Warning** page, select **No**. (In a production scenario, you should perform the validation tests.) Then, select **Next**.

1. On the **Confirmation** page, if you're using Storage Spaces, clear the **Add all eligible storage to the cluster** checkbox.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/46-add-node-confirmation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page in the Add Node Wizard that confirms the addition of a node to the cluster.":::

   >[!WARNING]
   >If you don't clear **Add all eligible storage to the cluster**, Windows detaches the virtual disks during the clustering process. As a result, they don't appear in **Disk Manager** or **Object Explorer** until the storage is removed from the cluster and reattached via PowerShell.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Select **Finish**.

   **Failover Cluster Manager** shows that your cluster has a new node and lists it in the **Nodes** container.

1. Sign out of the remote desktop session.

### Add a file share for a cluster quorum

In this example, the Windows cluster uses a file share to create a cluster quorum. This tutorial uses a `NodeAndFileShareMajority` quorum. For more information, see [Configure and manage quorum](/windows-server/failover-clustering/manage-cluster-quorum).

1. Connect to the file share witness server VM by using a remote desktop session.

1. In **Server Manager**, select **Tools**. Open **Computer Management**.

1. Select **Shared Folders**.

1. Right-click **Shares**, and then select **New Share**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/48-new-share.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selections for creating a new share in Computer Management. ":::

   Use the **Create a Shared Folder Wizard** to create a share.

1. On the **Folder Path** page, select **Browse**. Locate or create a path for the shared folder, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Name, Description, and Settings** page, verify the share name and path. Select **Next**.

1. On the **Shared Folder Permissions** page, set **Customize permissions**. Select **Custom**.

1. In the **Customize Permissions** dialog, select **Add**.

1. Make sure that the account that's used to create the cluster has full control.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/50-file-share-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dialog for customizing permissions, showing that the Install account has full control of the share. ":::

1. Select **OK**.

1. On the **Shared Folder Permissions** page, select **Finish**. Then select **Finish** again.  

1. Sign out of the server.

### Configure the cluster quorum

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the configuration of your availability group, it might be necessary to change the quorum vote of a node that's participating in the Windows Server failover cluster. For more information, see [Configure cluster quorum for SQL Server on Azure VMs](hadr-cluster-quorum-configure-how-to.md).

1. Connect to the first cluster node by using a remote desktop session.

1. In **Failover Cluster Manager**, right-click the cluster, point to **More Actions**, and then select **Configure Cluster Quorum Settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/52-configure-quorum.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Failover Cluster Manager that shows selections for configuring cluster quorum settings.":::

1. In the **Configure Cluster Quorum Wizard**, select **Next**.

1. On the **Select Quorum Configuration Option** page, choose **Select the quorum witness**, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Select Quorum Witness** page, select **Configure a file share witness**.

   >[!TIP]
   >Windows Server 2016 supports a cloud witness. If you choose this type of witness, you don't need a file share witness. For more information, see [Deploy a cloud witness for a failover cluster](/windows-server/failover-clustering/deploy-cloud-witness). This tutorial uses a file share witness, which previous operating systems support.

1. In **Configure File Share Witness**, enter the path for the share that you created. Then select **Next**.

1. On the **Confirmation** page, verify the settings. Then select **Next**.

1. Select **Finish**.

The cluster core resources are configured with a file share witness.

## Enable availability groups

Next, enable Always On availability groups. Complete these steps on both SQL Server VMs.

1. From the **Start** screen, open **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.
1. In the browser tree, select **SQL Server Services**. Then right-click the **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** service and select **Properties**.
1. Select the **Always On High Availability** tab, and then select **Enable Always On availability groups**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/54-enable-always-on.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selections for enabling Always On availability groups.":::

1. Select **Apply**. Select **OK** in the pop-up dialog.

1. Restart the SQL Server service.

<!-----------------
## <a name="endpoint-firewall"></a>Open a firewall for the database mirroring endpoint

Each instance of SQL Server that participates in an availability group requires a database mirroring endpoint. This endpoint is a TCP port for the instance of SQL Server that's used to synchronize the database replicas in the availability groups on that instance.

On both SQL Server VMs, open the firewall for the TCP port for the database mirroring endpoint:

1. On the **Start** screen for the first SQL Server VM, open **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security**.
2. On the left pane, select **Inbound Rules**. On the right pane, select **New Rule**.
3. For **Rule Type**, select **Port**.
1. For the port, specify **TCP** and choose an unused TCP port number. For example, enter *5022*. Then select **Next**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >The example in this tutorial uses TCP port 5022. You can use any available port.

5. On the **Action** page, keep **Allow the connection** selected and select **Next**.
6. On the **Profile** page, accept the default settings and select **Next**.
7. On the **Name** page, in the **Name** box, specify a rule name such as **Default Instance Mirroring Endpoint**. Then select **Finish**.

-------------------------->

## Create a database on the first SQL Server instance

1. Open the RDP file to the first SQL Server VM with a domain account that's a member of **sysadmin** fixed server role.
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to the first SQL Server instance.
1. In **Object Explorer**, right-click **Databases** and select **New Database**.
1. In **Database name**, enter **MyDB1**, and then select **OK**.

### <a name="backupshare"></a> Create a backup share

1. On the first SQL Server VM in **Server Manager**, select **Tools**. Open **Computer Management**.

1. Select **Shared Folders**.

1. Right-click **Shares**, and then select **New Share**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/48-new-share.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selections for starting the process of creating a backup share. ":::

   Use the **Create a Shared Folder Wizard** to create a share.

1. On the **Folder Path** page, select **Browse**. Locate or create a path for the database backup's shared folder, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Name, Description, and Settings** page, verify the share name and path. Then select **Next**.

1. On the **Shared Folder Permissions** page, set **Customize permissions**. Then select **Custom**.

1. In the **Customize Permissions** dialog, select **Add**.

1. Make sure that the accounts for the SQL Server and SQL Server Agent service on both servers have full control.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/68-backup-share-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Customize Permissions dialog with two SQL Server service accounts that have full control of the share.":::

1. Select **OK**.

1. On the **Shared Folder Permissions** page, select **Finish**. Select **Finish** again.  

### Take a full backup of the database

You need to back up the new database to initialize the log chain. If you don't take a backup of the new database, it can't be included in an availability group.

1. In **Object Explorer**, right-click the database, point to **Tasks**, and then select **Back Up**.

1. Select **OK** to take a full backup to the default backup location.

## Create an availability group

You're now ready to create and configure an availability group by doing the following tasks:

* Create a database on the first SQL Server instance.
* Take both a full backup and a transaction log backup of the database.
* Restore the full and log backups to the second SQL Server instance by using the `NO RECOVERY` option.
* Create the availability group (**MyTestAG**) with synchronous commit, automatic failover, and readable secondary replicas.

### Create the availability group

1. Connect to your SQL Server VM by using remote desktop, and open SQL Server Management Studio. 
1. In **Object Explorer** in SSMS, right-click **Always On High Availability** and select **New Availability Group Wizard**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/56-new-availability-group-wizard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Object Explorer in SSMS, with the shortcut command for starting the New Availability Group Wizard.":::

1. On the **Introduction** page, select **Next**. On the **Specify Availability Group Options** page, enter a name for the availability group in the **Availability group name** box. For example, enter **MyTestAG**. Then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/58-new-availability-group-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows specifying an availability group name in the New Availability Group Wizard in SSMS.":::

1. On the **Select Databases** page, select your database, and then select **Next**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >The database meets the prerequisites for an availability group because you've taken at least one full backup on the intended primary replica.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/60-new-availability-group-select-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting databases in the New Availability Group Wizard in SSMS.":::

1. On the **Specify Replicas** page, select **Add Replica**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/62-new-availability-group-add-replica.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the button for adding a replica in the New Availability Group Wizard in SSMS.":::

1. In the **Connect to Server** dialog, for **Server name**, enter the name of the second SQL Server instance. Then select **Connect**.

   Back on the **Specify Replicas** page, you should now see the second server listed under **Availability Replicas**. Configure the replicas as follows.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/64-new-availability-group-replica.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows two servers listed as replicas in the New Availability Group Wizard in SSMS.":::

1. Select **Endpoints** to see the database mirroring endpoint for this availability group. Use the same port that you used when you set the [firewall rule for database mirroring endpoints](availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-single-subnet.md#endpoint-firewall).

    :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/66-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Endpoints tab in the New Availability Group Wizard in SSMS.":::

1. On the **Select Initial Data Synchronization** page, select **Full** and specify a shared network location. For the location, use the [backup share that you created](#backupshare). In the example, it was **\\\\<First SQL Server Instance\>\Backup\\**. Select **Next**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Full synchronization takes a full backup of the database on the first instance of SQL Server and restores it to the second instance. For large databases, we don't recommend full synchronization because it might take a long time.
   >
   > You can reduce this time by manually taking a backup of the database and restoring it with `NO RECOVERY`. If the database is already restored with `NO RECOVERY` on the second SQL Server instance before you configure the availability group, select **Join only**. If you want to take the backup after configuring the availability group, select **Skip initial data synchronization**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/70-data-synchronization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the options for data synchronization in the New Availability Group Wizard in SSMS.":::

1. On the **Validation** page, select **Next**. This page should look similar to the following image:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/72-validation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page that shows the results of validation in the New Availability Group Wizard in SSMS.":::

    >[!NOTE]
    >There's a warning for the listener configuration because you haven't configured an availability group listener. You can ignore this warning because on Azure virtual machines, you create the listener after you create the Azure load balancer.

1. On the **Summary** page, select **Finish**, and then wait while the wizard configures the new availability group. On the **Progress** page, you can select **More details** to view the detailed progress.

   After the wizard finishes the configuration, inspect the **Results** page to verify that the availability group is successfully created.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/74-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows successful completion of the New Availability Group Wizard in SSMS.":::

1. Select **Close** to close the wizard.

### Check the availability group

1. In **Object Explorer**, expand **Always On High Availability**, and then expand **Availability Groups**. You should now see the new availability group in this container. Right-click the availability group and select **Show Dashboard**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/76-show-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Object Explorer in SSMS that shows selections for opening a dashboard for an availability group.":::

   Your availability group dashboard should look similar to the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/78-availability-group-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the availability group dashboard in SSMS.":::

   The dashboard shows the replicas, the failover mode of each replica, and the synchronization state.

1. In **Failover Cluster Manager**, select your cluster. Select **Roles**.

   The availability group name that you used is a role on the cluster. That availability group doesn't have an IP address for client connections because you didn't configure a listener. You'll configure the listener after you create an Azure load balancer.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/80-cluster-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an availability group in Failover Cluster Manager.":::

   > [!WARNING]
   > Don't try to fail over the availability group from Failover Cluster Manager. All failover operations should be performed on the availability group dashboard in SSMS. [Learn more about restrictions on using Failover Cluster Manager with availability groups](/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/failover-clustering-and-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server).
    >

At this point, you have an availability group with two SQL Server replicas. You can move the availability group between instances. You can't connect to the availability group yet because you don't have a listener.

In Azure virtual machines, the listener requires a load balancer. The next step is to create the load balancer in Azure.

## <a name="configure-internal-load-balancer"></a> Create an Azure load balancer

[!INCLUDE [sql-ag-use-dnn-listener](../../includes/sql-ag-use-dnn-listener.md)]

On Azure virtual machines in a single subnet, a SQL Server availability group requires a load balancer. The load balancer holds the IP addresses for the availability group listeners and the Windows Server failover cluster. This section summarizes how to create the load balancer in the Azure portal.

A load balancer in Azure can be either *standard* or *basic*. A standard load balancer has more features than the basic load balancer. For an availability group, the standard load balancer is required if you use an availability zone (instead of an availability set). For details on the difference between the SKUs, see [Azure Load Balancer SKUs](/azure/load-balancer/skus).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On September 30, 2025, the Basic SKU for Azure Load Balancer will be retired. For more information, see the [official announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-basic-load-balancer-will-be-retired-on-30-september-2025-upgrade-to-standard-load-balancer/). If you're currently using Basic Load Balancer, upgrade to Standard Load Balancer before the retirement date. For guidance, review [Upgrade Load Balancer](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-basic-upgrade-guidance).

1. In the Azure portal, go to the resource group that contains your SQL Server VMs and select **+ Add**.
1. Search for **load balancer**. Choose the load balancer that Microsoft publishes.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/82-azure-load-balancer.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting a Microsoft-published load balancer.":::

1. Select **Create**.
1. On the **Create load balancer** page, configure the following parameters for the load balancer:

   | Setting | Entry or selection |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Subscription** |Use the same subscription as the virtual machine. |
   | **Resource group** |Use the same resource group as the virtual machine. |
   | **Name** |Use a text name for the load balancer, such as **sqlLB**. |
   | **Region** |Use the same region as the virtual machine. |
   | **SKU** |Select **Standard**.|
   | **Type** |Select **Internal**. |

   The page should look like this:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/84-create-load-balancer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows selected parameters for a load balancer." lightbox="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/84-create-load-balancer.png":::

1. Select **Next: Frontend IP configuration**.

1. Select **+ Add a frontend IP configuration**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/add-fe-ip-config.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the button for creating a frontend IP configuration in the Azure portal.":::

1. Set up the frontend IP address by using the following values:

   - **Name**: Enter a name that identifies the frontend IP configuration.
   - **Virtual network**: Select the same network as the virtual machines.
   - **Subnet**: Select the same subnet as the virtual machines.
   - **Assignment**: Select **Static**.
   - **IP address**: Use an available address from the subnet. *Use this address for your availability group listener*. This address is different from your cluster IP address.
   - **Availability zone**: Optionally, choose an availability zone to deploy your IP address to.

   The following image shows the **Add frontend IP configuration** dialog:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/add-fe-ip-config-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the dialog for frontend IP configuration.":::

1. Select **Add**.

1. Choose **Review + Create** to validate the configuration. Then select  **Create** to create the load balancer and the frontend IP address.

To configure the load balancer, you need to create a backend pool, create a probe, and set the load-balancing rules.

### Add a backend pool for the availability group listener

1. In the Azure portal, go to your availability group. You might need to refresh the view to see the newly created load balancer.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/86-find-load-balancer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows a load balancer in an availability group.":::

1. Select the load balancer, select **Backend pools**, and then select **+Add**.

1. For **Name**, provide a name for the backend pool.

1. For **Backend Pool Configuration**, select **NIC**.

1. Select **Add** to associate the backend pool with the availability set that contains the VMs.

1. Under **Virtual machine**, choose the virtual machines that will host availability group replicas. Don't include the file share witness server.

   >[!NOTE]
   >If both virtual machines are not specified, only connections to the primary replica will succeed.

1. Select **Add** to add the virtual machines to the backend pool.

1. Select **Save** to create the backend pool.

### Set the probe

1. In the Azure portal, select the load balancer, select **Health probes**, and then select **+Add**.

1. Set the listener health probe as follows:

   | Setting | Description | Example
   | --- | --- |---
   | **Name** | Text | **SQLAlwaysOnEndPointProbe** |
   | **Protocol** | Choose TCP | **TCP** |
   | **Port** | Any unused port | **59999** |
   | **Interval**  | The amount of time between probe attempts, in seconds |**5** |

1. Select **Add**.

### Set the load balancing rules

1. In the Azure portal, select the load balancer, select **Load balancing rules**, and then select **+Add**.

1. Set the listener's load-balancing rules as follows:

   | Setting | Description | Example
   | --- | --- |---
   | **Name** | Text | **SQLAlwaysOnEndPointListener** |
   | **Frontend IP address** | Choose an address |Use the address that you created when you created the load balancer. |
   | **Backend pool** | Choose the backend pool |Select the backend pool that contains the virtual machines targeted for the load balancer. |
   | **Protocol** | Choose TCP |**TCP** |
   | **Port** | Use the port for the availability group listener | **1433** |
   | **Backend Port** | This field isn't used when a floating IP is set for direct server return | **1433** |
   | **Health Probe** |The name that you specified for the probe | **SQLAlwaysOnEndPointProbe** |

### Add the cluster core IP address for the Windows Server failover cluster

The IP address for the Windows Server failover cluster also needs to be on the load balancer. If you're using Windows Server 2019, skip this process because the cluster creates a **Distributed Server Name** value instead of the **Cluster Network Name** value.

1. In the Azure portal, go to the same Azure load balancer. Select **Frontend IP configuration**, and then select **+Add**. Use the IP address that you configured for the Windows Server failover cluster in the cluster core resources. Set the IP address as **Static**.

1. On the load balancer, select **Health probes**, and then select **+Add**.

1. Set the cluster core IP address health probe for the Windows Server failover cluster as follows:

   | Setting | Description | Example
   | --- | --- |---
   | **Name** | Text | **WSFCEndPointProbe** |
   | **Protocol** | Choose TCP | **TCP** |
   | **Port** | Any unused port | **58888** |
   | **Interval**  | The amount of time between probe attempts, in seconds |**5** |

1. Select **Add** to set the health probe.

1. Select **Load balancing rules**, and then select **+Add**.

1. Set the load-balancing rules for the cluster core IP address as follows:

   | Setting | Description | Example
   | --- | --- |---
   | **Name** | Text | **WSFCEndPoint** |
   | **Frontend IP address** | Choose an address |Use the address that you created when you configured the IP address for the Windows Server failover cluster. This is different from the listener IP address. |
   | **Backend pool** | Choose the backend pool |Select the backend pool that contains the virtual machines targeted for the load balancer. |
   | **Protocol** | Choose TCP |**TCP** |
   | **Port** | Use the port for the cluster IP address. This is an available port that isn't used for the listener probe port. | **58888** |
   | **Backend Port** | This field isn't used when a floating IP is set for direct server return | **58888** |
   | **Probe** |The name that you specified for the probe | **WSFCEndPointProbe** |
   | **Session Persistence** | Dropdown list | **None** |
   | **Idle Timeout** | Minutes to keep a TCP connection open | **4** |
   | **Floating IP (direct server return)** |A flow topology and an IP address mapping scheme |**Enabled** |

   > [!WARNING]
   > Direct server return is set during creation. You can't change it.

1. Select **OK**.

## <a name="configure-listener"></a> Configure the listener

The next thing to do is configure an availability group listener on the failover cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial shows how to create a single listener, with one IP address for the internal load balancer. To create listeners by using one or more IP addresses, see [Configure one or more Always On availability group listeners](availability-group-listener-powershell-configure.md).

[!INCLUDE [ag-listener-configure](../../includes/virtual-machines-ag-listener-configure.md)]

## Set the listener port

In SQL Server Management Studio, set the listener port:

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the primary replica.

1. Go to **Always On High Availability** > **Availability groups** > **Availability group listeners**.

1. Right-click the listener name that you created in Failover Cluster Manager, and then select **Properties**.

1. In the **Port** box, specify the port number for the availability group listener. The default is 1433. Select **OK**.

You now have an availability group for SQL Server on Azure VMs running in Azure Resource Manager mode.

## Test the connection to the listener

To test the connection:

1. Use RDP to connect to a SQL Server VM that's in the same virtual network but doesn't own the replica, such as the other replica.

1. Use the **sqlcmd** utility to test the connection. For example, the following script establishes a **sqlcmd** connection to the primary replica through the listener by using Windows authentication:

   ```cmd
   sqlcmd -S <listenerName> -E
   ```

   If the listener is using a port other than the default port (1433), specify the port in the connection string. For example, the following command connects to a listener at port 1435:

   ```cmd
   sqlcmd -S <listenerName>,1435 -E
   ```

The **sqlcmd** utility automatically connects to whichever SQL Server instance is the current primary replica of the availability group.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure that the port you specify is open on the firewall of both SQL Server VMs. Both servers require an inbound rule for the TCP port that you use. For more information, see [Add or edit firewall rules](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.11/cc753558(v=ws.11)).
