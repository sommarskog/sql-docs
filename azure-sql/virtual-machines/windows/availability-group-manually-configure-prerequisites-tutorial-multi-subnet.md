# Tutorial: Prerequisites for availability groups in multiple subnets (SQL Server on Azure VMs) 
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlvm](../../includes/appliesto-sqlvm.md)]

[!INCLUDE[tip-for-multi-subnet-ag](../../includes/virtual-machines-ag-listener-multi-subnet.md)]

In this tutorial, complete the prerequisites for creating an [Always On availability group for SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) in multiple subnets](availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-multi-subnet.md). At the end of this tutorial, you will have a domain controller on two Azure virtual machines, two SQL Server VMs in multiple subnets, and a storage account in a single resource group.

**Time estimate**: This tutorial creates several resources in Azure and may take up to 30 minutes to complete.

The following diagram illustrates the resources you deploy in this tutorial:

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

- An Azure subscription. You can [open a free Azure account](https://signup.azure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p&appId=102&ref=azureplat-generic) or [activate Visual Studio subscriber benefits](/visualstudio/subscriptions/subscriber-benefits).
- A basic understanding of, and familiarity with, [Always On availability groups in SQL Server](/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/overview-of-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server).

## Create resource group

To create the resource group in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **+ Create a resource** to create a new resource in the portal.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/01-portal-plus.png" alt-text="Select +Create a resource to create a new resource in the portal.":::

1. Search for **resource group** in the **Marketplace** search box and choose the **Resource group** tile from Microsoft. Select **Create** on the **Resource group** page.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/01-resource-group-search.png" alt-text="Search for resource group in the Marketplace and then choose to create the Resource group. ":::

1. On the **Create a resource group** page, fill out the values to create the resource group:
   1. Choose the appropriate Azure subscription from the drop-down.
   1. Provide a name for your resource group, such as **SQL-HA-RG**.
   1. Choose a region from the drop-down, such as **West US 2**. Be sure to deploy all subsequent resources to this location as well.
   1. Select **Review + create** to review your resource parameters, and then select **Create** to create your resource group.  

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/01-resource-group-create-complete.png" alt-text="Fill out the values to create your resource group in the Azure portal. ":::

## Create network and subnets

Next, create the virtual network and three subnets. To learn more, see [Virtual network overview](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview).

To create the virtual network in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Go to your resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **+ Create**

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/02-create-resource-rg.png" alt-text="Create new resource in your resource group":::

1. Search for **virtual network** in the **Marketplace** search box and choose the **virtual network** tile from Microsoft. Select **Create** on the **Virtual network** page.  
1. On the **Create virtual network** page, enter the following information on the **Basics** tab:
   1. Under **Project details**, choose the appropriate Azure **Subscription**, and the **Resource group** you created previously, such as **SQL-HA-RG**.
   1. Under **Instance details**, provide a name for your virtual network, such as **SQLHAVNET**, and choose the same region as your resource group from the drop-down.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/03-create-vnet-basics.png" alt-text="Choose the resource group you made previously, then provide a name for your virtual network, such as SQLHAVNET":::

1. On the **IP addresses** tab, select the **default** subnet to open the **Edit subnet** page. Change the name to **DC-subnet** to use for the domain controller subnet. Select **Save**.  

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/04-create-vnet-ip-address-rename-default-subnet.png" alt-text="On the IP addresses tab, select the default subnet to open the Edit subnet page. Change the name to DC-subnet to use for the domain controller subnet. Select Save":::

1. Select **+ Add subnet** to add an additional subnet for your first SQL Server VM, and fill in the following values:
   1. Provide a value for the **Subnet name**, such as **SQL-subnet-1**.
   1. Provide a unique subnet address range within the virtual network address space. For example, you can iterate the third octet of DC-subnet address range by 1.
      - For example, if your **DC-subnet** range is *10.38.0.0/24*, enter the IP address range `10.38.1.0/24` for **SQL-subnet-1**.
      - Likewise, if your **DC-subnet** IP range is *10.5.0.0/24*, then enter `10.5.1.0/24` for the new subnet.
   1. Select **Add** to add your new subnet.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/05-create-vnet-ip-address-add-sql-subnet-1.png" alt-text="Name your first subnet, such as sql-subnet-1, and then iterate the third octet by 1, so that if your DC-subnet IP address is 10.5.0.0, your new subnet should be 10.5.1.0":::

1. Repeat the previous step to add an additional unique subnet range for your second SQL Server VM with a name such as **SQL-subnet-2**. You can iterate the third octet by one again.
   - For example, if your **DC-subnet** IP range is *10.38.0.0/24*, and your **SQL-subnet-1** is *10.38.1.0/24*, then enter `10.38.2.0/24` for the new subnet.
   - Likewise, if your **DC-subnet** IP range is *10.5.0.0/24*, and your **SQL-subnet-1** is *10.5.1.0/24*, then enter the IP address range `10.5.2.0/24` for **SQL-subnet-2**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/06-create-vnet-ip-address-add-sql-subnet-2.png" alt-text="Name your second subnet, such as sql-subnet-2, and then iterate the third octet by 2, so that if your DC-subnet IP address is 10.38.0.0/24, your new subnet should be 10.38.2.0/24":::

1. After you've added the second subnet, review your subnet names and ranges (your IP address ranges may differ from the image). If everything looks correct, select **Review + create**, then **Create** to create your new virtual network.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/07-create-vnet-ip-address.png" alt-text="After you've added the second subnet, review your subnet names and ranges, like the image example (though your IP addresses may be different). If everything looks correct, select Review + create, then Create to create your new virtual network.":::

   Azure returns you to the portal dashboard and notifies you when the new network is created.

## Create domain controllers

After your network and subnets are ready, create a virtual machine (or two optionally, for high availability) and configure it as your domain controller.

### Create DC virtual machines

To create your domain controller (DC) virtual machines in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Go to your resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **+ Create**

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/02-create-resource-rg.png" alt-text="Create new resource in your resource group":::

1. Search for **Windows Server** in the **Marketplace** search box.
1. On the **Windows Server** tile from Microsoft, select the **Create** drop-down and choose the **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter** image.
1. Fill out the values on the **Create a virtual machine** page to create your domain controller VM, such as **DC-VM-1**. Optionally, create an additional VM, such as **DC-VM-2** to provide high availability for the Active Directory Domain Services. Use the values in the following tablet to create your VM(s):

    | **Field** | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Subscription** |*Your subscription* |
    | **Resource group** |SQL-HA-RG |
    | **Virtual machine name** |First domain controller: *DC-VM-1*.</br>Second domain controller *DC-VM-2*. |
    | **Region** |*The location where you deployed your resource group and virtual network.* |
    | **Availability options** |Availability zone </br> *For Azure regions that do not support Availability zones, use Availability sets instead. Create a new availability set and place all VMs created in this tutorial inside the availability set.* |
    | **Availability zone** |Specify 1 for DC-VM-1. </br> Specify 2 for DC-VM-2. |
    | **Size** |D2s_v3 (2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM) |
    | **User name** |DomainAdmin |
    | **Password** |Contoso!0000 |
    | **Public inbound ports** | *Allow selected ports* |
    | **Select inbound ports** | *RDP (3389)* |
    | **OS disk type** | Premium SSD (locally redundant storage) |
    | **Virtual network** |SQLHAVNET |
    | **Subnet** |DC-subnet |
    | **Public IP** |*Same name as the VM, such as DC-VM-1 or DC-VM-2* |
    | **NIC network security group**| Basic |
    | **Public inbound ports**| Allow selected ports |
    | **Select inbound ports**| RDP (3389) |
    | **Boot diagnostics** |Enable with managed storage account (recommended). |

    Azure notifies you when your virtual machines are created and ready to use.

### Configure the domain controller

After your DC virtual machines are ready, configure the domain controller for corp.contoso.com.

To configure **DC-VM-1** as the domain controller, follow these steps:

1. Go to your resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **DC-VM-1** machine.
1. On the **DC-VM-1** page, select **Connect** to download an RDP file for remote desktop access and then open the file.  

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/08-dc-vm-1-rdp-connect.png" alt-text="Connect to a virtual machine":::

1. Connect to the RDP session using your configured administrator account (**DomainAdmin**) and password (**Contoso!0000**).
1. Open the **Server Manager** dashboard (which may open by default) and choose to **Add roles and features**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/09-add-features.png" alt-text="Server Manager - Add roles":::

1. Select **Next** until you get to the **Server Roles** section.
1. Select the **Active Directory Domain Services** and **DNS Server** roles. When you're prompted, add any additional features that are required by these roles.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Windows warns you that there is no static IP address. If you're testing the configuration, select **Continue**. For production scenarios, set the IP address to static in the Azure portal, or [use PowerShell to set the static IP address of the domain controller machine](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-static-private-ip-arm-ps).
   >

    :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/10-add-roles.png" alt-text="Add Roles dialog":::

1. Select **Next** until you reach the **Confirmation** section. Select the **Restart the destination server automatically if required** check box.
1. Select **Install**.
1. After the features finish installing, return to the **Server Manager** dashboard.
1. Select the new **AD DS** option on the left-hand pane.
1. Select the **More** link on the yellow warning bar.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/11-ad-ds-more.png" alt-text="AD DS dialog on the DNS Server VM":::
    
1. In the **Action** column of the **All Server Task Details** dialog, select **Promote this server to a domain controller**.
1. In the **Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard**, use the following values:

    | **Page** | Setting |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Deployment Configuration** |**Add a new forest**<br/> **Root domain name** = corp.contoso.com |
    | **Domain Controller Options** |**DSRM Password** = Contoso!0000<br/>**Confirm Password** = Contoso!0000 |

1. Select **Next** to go through the other pages in the wizard. On the **Prerequisites Check** page, verify that you see the following message: **All prerequisite checks passed successfully**. You can review any applicable warning messages, but it's possible to continue with the installation.
1. Select **Install**. The **DC-VM-1** virtual machine automatically restarts.

### Identify DNS IP address

Use the primary domain controller for DNS. To do so, identify the private IP address of the VM used for the primary domain controller.

To identify the private IP address of the VM in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Go to your resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the primary domain controller, **DC-VM-1**.
1. On the **DC-VM-1** page, choose **Networking** in the **Settings** pane.
1. Note the **NIC Private IP** address. Use this IP address as the DNS server for the other virtual machines.  In the example image, the private IP address is **10.38.0.4**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/12-dc-vm-1-private-ip.png" alt-text="On the DC-VM-1 page, choose Networking in the Settings pane, and then note the NIC private IP address. Use this IP address as the DNS server. ":::

### Configure virtual network DNS

After you create the first domain controller and enable DNS, configure the virtual network to use this VM for DNS.

To configure your virtual network for DNS, follow these steps:

1. Go to your resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and select your virtual network, such as **SQLHAVNET**.
1. Select **DNS servers** under the **Settings** pane and then select **Custom**.
1. Enter the private IP address you identified previously in the **IP Address** field, such as `10.38.0.4`.
1. Select **Save**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/12-identify-dns-ip-address.png" alt-text=" Select DNS servers under the Settings pane and then select Custom. Enter the private IP address you identified previously in the IP Address field, such as 10.38.0.4. ":::

### Configure second domain controller

After the primary domain controller restarts, you can optionally configure the second domain controller for the purpose of high availability. If you do not want to configure a second domain controller, skip this step. However, a second domain controller is recommended in production environments.

Set the preferred DNS server address, join the domain, and then configure the secondary domain controller.

#### Set preferred DNS server address

The preferred DNS server address [should not be updated](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances#specify-dns-servers) directly within a VM, it should be edited from the [Azure portal, or PowerShell, or Azure CLI](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface?tabs=network-interface-portal#change-dns-servers). The steps below are to make the change inside of the Azure portal:

1. Sign-in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Network interface**. Select **Network interfaces** in the search results.

1. Select the network interface for the second domain controller that you want to view or change settings for from the list.

1. In **Settings**, select **DNS servers**.

1. Select either:
   
    - **Inherit from virtual network**: Choose this option to inherit the DNS server setting defined for the virtual network the network interface is assigned to. This would automatically inherit the primary domain controller as the DNS server.
   
    - **Custom**: You can configure your own DNS server to resolve names across multiple virtual networks. Enter the IP address of the server you want to use as a DNS server. The DNS server address you specify is assigned only to this network interface and overrides any DNS setting for the virtual network the network interface is assigned to. If you select custom, then input the IP address of the primary domain controller, such as `10.38.0.4`.

1. Select **Save**.
1. If using a **Custom** DNS Server, return to the virtual machine in the Azure portal and restart the VM.

### Join the domain

Next, join the **corp.contoso.com** domain. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Remotely connect to the virtual machine using the **BUILTIN\DomainAdmin** account. This account is the same one used when [creating the domain controller virtual machines](availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet.md?#create-dc-virtual-machines).
1. Open **Server Manager**, and select **Local Server**.
1. Select **WORKGROUP**.
1. In the **Computer Name** section, select **Change**.
1. Select the **Domain** checkbox and type **corp.contoso.com** in the text box. Select **OK**.
1. In the **Windows Security** popup dialog, specify the credentials for the default domain administrator account (**CORP\DomainAdmin**) and the password (**Contoso!0000**).
1. When you see the "Welcome to the corp.contoso.com domain" message, select **OK**.
1. Select **Close**, and then select **Restart Now** in the popup dialog.

#### Configure domain controller

Once your server has joined the domain, you can configure it as the second domain controller. To do so, follow these steps:

1. If you're not already connected, open an RDP session to your secondary domain controller, and open **Server Manager Dashboard** (which may be open by default).
1. Select the **Add roles and features** link on the dashboard.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/09-add-features.png" alt-text="Server Manager - Add roles":::

1. Select **Next** until you get to the **Server Roles** section.
1. Select the **Active Directory Domain Services** and **DNS Server** roles. When you're prompted, add any additional features that are required by these roles.
1. After the features finish installing, return to the **Server Manager** dashboard.
1. Select the new **AD DS** option on the left-hand pane.
1. Select the **More** link on the yellow warning bar.
1. In the **Action** column of the **All Server Task Details** dialog, select **Promote this server to a domain controller**.
1. Under **Deployment Configuration**, select **Add a domain controller to an existing domain**.
1. Click **Select**.
1. Connect by using the administrator account (**CORP.CONTOSO.COM\domainadmin**) and password (**Contoso!0000**).
1. In **Select a domain from the forest**, choose your domain and then select **OK**.
1. In **Domain Controller Options**, use the default values and set a DSRM password.

    >[!NOTE]
    >The **DNS Options** page might warn you that a delegation for this DNS server can't be created. You can ignore this warning in non-production environments.
    >

1. Select **Next** until the dialog reaches the **Prerequisites** check. Then select **Install**.

After the server finishes the configuration changes, restart the server.

### Add second DC IP address to DNS

After your second domain controller is configured, follow the same steps as before to [identify the private IP address of the VM](#identify-dns-ip-address), and [add the private IP address as a secondary custom DNS server](#configure-virtual-network-dns) in the virtual network of your resource group. Adding the secondary DNS server in the Azure portal enables redundancy of the DNS service.

## Configure domain accounts

After your domain controller(s) have been configured, and you've set your DNS server(s) in the Azure portal, create domain accounts for the user who is installing SQL Server, and for the SQL Server service account.

Configure two accounts in total, one installation account and then a service account for both SQL Server VMs. For example, use the values in the following table for the accounts:

|Account  | VM  |Full domain name  |Description   |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Install    |Both| Corp\Install        |Log in to either VM with this account to configure the cluster and availability group. |
|SQLSvc     |Both |Corp\SQLSvc | Use this account for the SQL Server service on both SQL Server VMs. |

Follow these steps to create each account:

1. Connect to your primary domain controller machine, such as **DC-VM-1**.
1. In **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **Active Directory Administrative Center**.
1. Select **corp (local)** from the left pane.
1. On the right **Tasks** pane, select **New**, and then select **User**.
1. Enter in the new user account and set a complex password. For non-production environments, set the user account to never expire.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/14-ad-dc-new-user.png" alt-text="Active Directory Administrative Center":::

1. Select **OK** to create the user.
1. Repeat these steps to create all accounts.

### Grant installation account permissions

Once the accounts are created, grant required domain permissions to the installation account so the account is able to create objects in AD.

To grant the permissions to the installation account, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Active Directory Administrative Center** from **Server Manager**, if it's not open already.
1. Select **corp (local)** in the left pane.
1. In the right-hand **Tasks** pane, verify you see **corp (local)** in the drop-down, and then select **Properties** underneath.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/15-ad-dc-properties.png" alt-text="CORP user properties":::

1. Select **Extensions**, and then select the **Advanced** button on the **Security** tab.
1. On the **Advanced Security Settings for corp** dialog box, select **Add**.
1. Select **Select a principal**, search for **CORP\Install**, and then select **OK**.
1. Check the boxes next to **Read all properties** and **Create Computer Objects**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/16-add-permissions.png" alt-text="Corp user permissions":::

1. Select **OK**, and then select **OK** again. Close the **corp** properties window.

Now that you've finished configuring Active Directory and the user objects, you are ready to create your SQL Server VMs.

## Create SQL Server VMs

Once your AD, DNS, and user accounts are configured, you are ready to create your SQL Server VMs. For simplicity, use the SQL Server VM images in the marketplace.

However, before creating your SQL Server VMs, consider the following design decisions:

**Availability - Availability Zones**

For the highest level of redundancy, resiliency and availability deploy the VMs within separate Availability Zones. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters with independent power, cooling, and networking. For Azure regions that do not support Availability Zones yet, use Availability Sets instead. Place all the VMs within the same Availability Set.

**Storage - Azure Managed Disks**

For the virtual machine storage, use Azure Managed Disks. Microsoft recommends Managed Disks for SQL Server virtual machines as they handle storage behind the scenes. For more information, see [Azure Managed Disks Overview](/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview).

**Network - Private IP addresses in production**

For the virtual machines, this tutorial uses public IP addresses. A public IP address enables remote connection directly to the virtual machine over the internet and makes configuration steps easier. In production environments, Microsoft recommends only private IP addresses in order to reduce the vulnerability footprint of the SQL Server instance VM resource.

**Network - Single NIC per server**

Use a single NIC per server (cluster node). Azure networking has physical redundancy, which makes additional NICs unnecessary on a failover cluster deployed to an Azure virtual machine. The cluster validation report warns you that the nodes are reachable only on a single network. You can ignore this warning when your failover cluster is on Azure virtual machines.

To create your VMs, follow these steps:

1. Go to your resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **+ Create**.
1. Search for **Azure SQL** and select the **Azure SQL** tile from Microsoft.
1. On the **Azure SQL** page, select **Create** and then choose the **SQL Server 2016 SP2 Enterprise on Windows Server 2016** image from the drop-down.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/18-select-sql-vm-image.png" alt-text=" On the Azure SQL page of the portal, select Create and then choose the SQL Server 2016 SP2 Enterprise on Windows Server 2016 image from the drop-down.":::

Use the following table to fill out the values on the **Create a virtual machine** page to create both SQL Server VMs, such as **SQL-VM-1** and **SQL-VM-2** (your IP addresses may differ from the examples in the table):

| Configuration | SQL-VM-1 | SQL-VM-2 |

## Configure SQL Server VMs

After VM creation completes, configure your SQL Server VMs by adding a secondary IP address to each VM, and joining them to the domain.

### Add secondary IPs to SQL Server VMs

In the multi-subnet environment, assign secondary IP addresses to each SQL Server VM to use for the availability group listener, and for Windows Server 2016 and earlier, assign secondary IP addresses to each SQL Server VM for the cluster IP address as well. Doing this negates the need for an Azure Load Balancer, as is the requirement in a single subnet environment.  

On Windows Server 2016 and earlier, you need to assign an additional secondary IP address to each SQL Server VM to use for the windows cluster IP since the cluster uses the **Cluster Network Name** rather than the default Distributed Network Name (DNN) introduced in Windows Server 2019. With a DNN, the cluster name object (CNO) is automatically registered with the IP addresses for all the nodes of the cluster, eliminating the need for a dedicated windows cluster IP address.

If you're on Windows Server 2016 and prior, follow the steps in this section to assign a secondary IP address to each SQL Server VM for *both* the availability group listener, *and* the cluster.

If you're on Windows Server 2019 or later, only assign a secondary IP address for the availability group listener, and skip the steps to assign a windows cluster IP, unless you plan to configure your cluster with a virtual network name (VNN), in which case assign both IP addresses to each SQL Server VM as you would for Windows Server 2016.

To assign additional secondary IPs to the VMs, follow these steps:

1. Go to your resource group in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select the first SQL Server VM, such as **SQL-VM-1**.
1. Select **Networking** in the **Settings** pane, and then select the **Network Interface**:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/19-sql-vm-network-interface.png" alt-text="Select Networking in the Settings pane, and then select the Network Interface":::

1. On the **Network Interface** page, select **IP configurations** in the **Settings** pane and then choose **+ Add** to add an additional IP address:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/20-ip-configurations-add.png" alt-text="IP configurations":::

1. On the **Add IP configuration** page, do the following:
   1. Specify the **Name** as the Windows Cluster IP, such as **windows-cluster-ip** for Windows 2016 and earlier. Skip this step if you're on Windows Server 2019 or later.  
   1. Set the **Allocation** to **Static**.
   1. Enter an unused **IP address** in the same subnet (**SQL-subnet-1**) as the SQL Server VM (**SQL-VM-1**), such as `10.38.1.10`.
   1. Leave the **Public IP address** at the default of **Disassociate**.
   1. Select **OK** to finish adding the IP configuration.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/21-add-ip-windows-cluster.png" alt-text="Add Cluster IP by entering in an used IP address in the subnet of the first SQL Server VM":::

1. Select **+ Add** again to configure an additional IP address for the availability group listener (with a name such as **availability-group-listener**), again specifying an unused IP address in **SQL-subnet-1** such as `10.38.1.11`:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/22-add-ip-ag-listener.png" alt-text="Select + Add again to configure an additional IP address for the availability group listener (with a name such as availability-group-listener), again using an unused IP address in SQL-subnet-1 such as 10.31.1.11":::

1. Repeat these steps again for the second SQL Server VM, such as **SQL-VM-2**. Assign two unused secondary IP addresses within **SQL-subnet-2**. Use the values from the following table to add the IP configuration:

   
    | **Field** | Input | Input |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Name** |windows-cluster-ip | availability-group-listener |
    | **Allocation** | Static | Static |
    | **IP address** | 10.38.2.10 | 10.38.2.11 |

Now you are ready to join the **corp.contoso.com**.

### Join the servers to the domain

Once your two secondary IP addresses have been assigned to both SQL Server VMs, join each SQL Server VM to the **corp.contoso.com** domain.

To join the corp.contoso.com domain, follow the same steps for the SQL Server VM as you did when you [joined the domain](#join-the-domain) with the secondary domain controller.

Wait for each SQL Server VM to restart, and then you can add your accounts.

## Add accounts

Add the installation account as an administrator on each VM, grant permission to the installation account and local accounts within SQL Server, and update the SQL Server service account.

### Add install account

Once both SQL Server VMs have joined the domain, add **CORP\Install** as a member of the local administrators group.

>[!TIP]
> Be sure you sign in with the *domain* administrator account. In previous steps, you were using the **BUILTIN** administrator account. Now that the server is part of the domain, use the domain account. In your RDP session, specify *DOMAIN*\\*username*, such as **CORP\DomainAdmin**.

To add the account as an admin, follow these steps:

1. Wait until the VM is restarted, then launch the RDP file again from the first SQL Server VM to sign in to **SQL-VM-1** by using the **CORP\DomainAdmin** account.
1. In **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **Computer Management**.
1. In the **Computer Management** window, expand **Local Users and Groups**, and then select **Groups**.
1. Double-click the **Administrators** group.
1. In the **Administrators Properties** dialog, select the **Add** button.
1. Enter the user **CORP\Install**, and then select **OK**.
1. Select **OK** to close the **Administrator Properties** dialog.
1. Repeat these steps on **SQL-VM-2**.

### Add account to sysadmin

The installation account (CORP\install) used to configure the availability group must be part of the **sysadmin** fixed server role on each SQL Server VM.

To grant **sysadmin** rights to the installation account, follow these steps:

1. Connect to the server through the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by using the *\<MachineName\>\DomainAdmin* account, such as `SQL-VM-1\DomainAdmin`.
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the local instance of SQL Server.
1. In **Object Explorer**, select **Security**.
1. Right-click **Logins**. Select **New Login**.
1. In **Login - New**, select **Search**.
1. Select **Locations**.
1. Enter the domain administrator network credentials.
1. Use the installation account (CORP\install).
1. Set the sign-in to be a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Repeat these steps on the second SQL Server VM, such as **SQL-VM-2**, connecting with the relevant machine name account, such as `SQL-VM-2\DomainAdmin`.

### Add system account

In later versions of SQL Server, the [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM] account does not have permissions to SQL Server by default, and must be granted manually.

To add the [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM] and grant appropriate permissions, follow these steps:

1. Connect to the first SQL Server VM through the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by using the *\<MachineName\>\DomainAdmin* account, such as `SQL-VM-1\DomainAdmin`.
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the local instance of SQL Server.
1. Create an account for `[NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM]` on each SQL Server instance by using the following Transact-SQL (T-SQL) command:

   ```sql
   USE [master]
   GO
   CREATE LOGIN [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM] FROM WINDOWS WITH DEFAULT_DATABASE=[master]
   GO 
   ```

1. Grant the following permissions to `[NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM]` on each SQL Server instance:

   - `ALTER ANY AVAILABILITY GROUP`
   - `CONNECT SQL`
   - `VIEW SERVER STATE`

   To grant these permissions, use the following Transact-SQL (T-SQL) command:

   ```sql
   GRANT ALTER ANY AVAILABILITY GROUP TO [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM]
   GO
   GRANT CONNECT SQL TO [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM]
   GO
   GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM]
   GO 
   ```

1. Repeat these steps on the second SQL Server VM, such as **SQL-VM-2**, connecting with the relevant machine name account, such as `SQL-VM-2\DomainAdmin`.

### Set the SQL Server service accounts

The SQL Server service on each VM needs to use a dedicated domain account.  Use the domain accounts you created earlier: **Corp\SQLSvc** for both **SQL-VM-1** and **SQL-VM-2**.

To set the service account, follow these steps:

1. Connect to the first SQL Server VM through the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by using the *\<MachineName\>\DomainAdmin* account, such as `SQL-VM-1\DomainAdmin`.
1. Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.
1. Right-click the SQL Server service, and then select **Properties**.
1. Provide the account (**Corp\SQLSvc**) and password.
1. Select **Apply** to commit your change and restart the SQL Server service. 
1. Repeat these steps on the other SQL Server VM (SQL-VM-1), signing in with the machine domain account, such as `SQL-VM-2\DomainAdmin`, and providing the service account (**Corp\SQLSvc**). 

## Create Azure Storage Account

To deploy a two-node Windows Server Failover Cluster, a third member is necessary to establish quorum. On Azure VMs, the cloud witness is the recommended quorum option. To configure a cloud witness, you need an Azure Storage account. To learn more, see [Deploy a Cloud Witness for a Failover Cluster](/windows-server/failover-clustering/deploy-cloud-witness).

To create the Azure Storage Account in the portal:

1. In the portal, open the **SQL-HA-RG** resource group and select **+ Create**
1. Search for **storage account**.
1. Select **Storage account** and select **Create**, configuring it with the following values:

    1. Select your subscription and select the resource group **SQL-HA-RG.**
    1. Enter a **Storage Account Name** for your storage account.
       Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only. The storage account name must also be unique within Azure.
    1. Select your **Region.**
    1. For **Performance**, select **Standard: Recommended for most scenarios (general-purpose v2 account)**. Azure Premium Storage is not supported for a cloud witness.
    1. For **Redundancy**, select **Locally redundant storage (LRS).**
       Failover Clustering uses the blob file as the arbitration point, which requires some consistency guarantees when reading the data. Therefore you must select Locally redundant storage for the Replication type.
    1. Select **Review + create**

## Configure the firewall

The availability group feature relies on traffic through the following TCP ports:

- **SQL Server VM**: Port 1433 for a default instance of SQL Server.
- **Database mirroring endpoint:** Any available port. Examples frequently use 5022.

Open these firewall ports on both SQL Server VMs. The method of opening the ports depends on the firewall solution that you use, and may vary from the Windows Firewall example provided in this section.

To open these ports on a Windows Firewall, follow these steps:

1. On the first SQL Server **Start** screen, launch **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security**.
1. On the left pane, select **Inbound Rules**. On the right pane, select **New Rule**.
1. For **Rule Type**, choose **Port**.
1. For the port, specify **TCP** and type the appropriate port numbers. See the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet/17-firewall-tcp-ports.png" alt-text="SQL firewall":::

1. Select **Next**.
1. On the **Action** page, select **Allow the connection** , and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Profile** page, accept the default settings, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Name** page, specify a rule name (such as **SQL Inbound**) in the **Name** text box, and then select **Finish**.
1. Repeat these steps on the second SQL Server VM.
