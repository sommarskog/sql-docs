# Configure an Azure load balancer for an FCI VNN - SQL Server on Azure VMs
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlvm](../../includes/appliesto-sqlvm.md)]

[!INCLUDE[tip-for-multi-subnet-ag](../../includes/virtual-machines-ag-listener-multi-subnet.md)]

On Azure virtual machines, clusters use a load balancer to hold an IP address that needs to be on one cluster node at a time. In this solution, the load balancer holds the IP address for the virtual network name (VNN) that the clustered resource uses in Azure. 

This article teaches you to configure a load balancer by using the Azure Load Balancer service. The load balancer will route traffic to your [failover cluster instance](failover-cluster-instance-overview.md) with SQL Server on Azure VMs for high availability and disaster recovery (HADR). 

For an alternative connectivity option for SQL Server 2019 CU2 and later, consider a [distributed network name (DNN)](failover-cluster-instance-distributed-network-name-dnn-configure.md) instead. A DNN offers simplified configuration and improved failover. 

## Prerequisites

Before you complete the steps in this article, you should already have:

- Determined that Azure Load Balancer is the appropriate [connectivity option for your FCI](hadr-windows-server-failover-cluster-overview.md#virtual-network-name-vnn).
- Configured your [FCI](failover-cluster-instance-overview.md). 
- Installed the latest version of [PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows). 

## Create a load balancer

You can create either of these types of load balancers:

- **Internal**: An internal load balancer can be accessed only from private resources that are internal to the network. When you configure an internal load balancer and its rules, use the FCI IP address as the front-end IP address. 
- **External**: An external load balancer can route traffic from the public to internal resources. When you configure an external load balancer, you can't use a public IP address like the FCI IP address. 

  To use an external load balancer, logically allocate an IP address in the same subnet as the FCI that doesn't conflict with any other IP address. Use this address as the front-end IP address for the load-balancing rules. 

To create the load balancer:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to the resource group that contains the virtual machines.

1. Select **Add**. Search Azure Marketplace for **load balancer**. Select **Load Balancer**.

1. Select **Create**.

1. In **Create load balancer**, on the **Basics** tab, set up the load balancer by using the following values:

   - **Subscription**: Your Azure subscription.
   - **Resource group**: The resource group that contains your virtual machines.
   - **Name**: A name that identifies the load balancer.
   - **Region**: The Azure location that contains your virtual machines.
   - **SKU**: **Standard**.
   - **Type**: Either **Public** or **Internal**. An internal load balancer can be accessed from within the virtual network. Most Azure applications can use an internal load balancer. If your application needs access to SQL Server directly over the internet, use a public load balancer.
   - **Tier**: **Regional**.

1. Select **Next: Frontend IP configuration**.

1. Select **Add a frontend IP configuration**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/availability-group-manually-configure-tutorial-single-subnet/add-fe-ip-config.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the button for adding a front-end IP configuration.":::

1. Set up the front-end IP address by using the following values:

   - **Name**: A name that identifies the front-end IP configuration.
   - **Virtual network**: The same network as the virtual machines.
   - **Subnet**: The same subnet as the virtual machines.
   - **Assignment**: **Static**.
   - **IP address**: The IP address that you assigned to the clustered network resource.
   - **Availability zone**: An optional availability zone to deploy your IP address to.

1. Select **Add** to create the front-end IP address.

1. Choose **Review + Create** to create the load balancer.

## Configure a backend pool

1. Return to the Azure resource group that contains the virtual machines and locate the new load balancer. You might need to refresh the view on the resource group. Select the load balancer.

1. Select **Backend pools**, and then select **+Add**.

1. For **Name**, provide a name for the backend pool.

1. For **Backend Pool Configuration**, select **NIC**.

1. Select **Add** to associate the backend pool with the availability set that contains the VMs.

1. Under **Virtual machine**, choose the virtual machines that will participate as cluster nodes. Be sure to include all virtual machines that will host the FCI. 

   Add only the primary IP address of each VM. Don't add any secondary IP addresses.

1. Select **Add** to add the virtual machines to the backend pool.

1. Select **Save** to create the backend pool.

## Configure a health probe

1. On the pane for the load balancer, select **Health probes**.

1. On the **Add health probe** pane, <span id="probe"> </span> set the following parameters:

   - **Name**: A name for the health probe.
   - **Protocol**: **TCP**.
   - **Port**: The port that you created in the firewall for the health probe [when preparing the VM](failover-cluster-instance-prepare-vm.md#uninstall-sql-server-1). In this article, the example uses TCP port **59999**.
   - **Interval**: **5 Seconds**.

1. Select **Add**.

## Set load-balancing rules

1. On the pane for the load balancer, select **Load-balancing rules**.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Set these parameters:

   - **Name**: A name for the load-balancing rule.
   - **Frontend IP address**: The IP address that you set when you configured the frontend.
   - **Backend pool**: The backend pool that contains the virtual machines targeted for the load balancer.
   - **HA Ports**: Enables load balancing on all ports for TCP and UDP protocols.
   - **Protocol**: **TCP**.
   - **Port**: The SQL Server TCP port. The default is **1433**.
   - **Backend port**: The same port as the **Port** value when you enable **Floating IP (direct server return)**.
   - **Health probe**: The health probe that you configured earlier.
   - **Session persistence**: **None**.
   - **Idle timeout (minutes)**: **4**.
   - **Floating IP (direct server return)**: Enabled.

1. Select **Save**.

## Configure a cluster probe

Set the cluster probe's port parameter in PowerShell.

# [Private load balancer](#tab/ilb)

Update the variables in the following script with values from your environment. Remove the angle brackets (`<` and `>`) from the script.

```powershell
$ClusterNetworkName = "<Cluster Network Name>"
$IPResourceName = "<SQL Server FCI IP Address Resource Name>" 
$ILBIP = "<n.n.n.n>" 
[int]$ProbePort = <nnnnn>

Import-Module FailoverClusters

Get-ClusterResource $IPResourceName | Set-ClusterParameter -Multiple @{"Address"="$ILBIP";"ProbePort"=$ProbePort;"SubnetMask"="255.255.255.255";"Network"="$ClusterNetworkName";"EnableDhcp"=0}
```

The following table describes the values that you need to update:

|**Variable**|**Value**|
|---------|---------|
|`ClusterNetworkName`| The name of the Windows Server failover cluster for the network. In **Failover Cluster Manager** > **Networks**, right-click the network and select **Properties**. The correct value is under **Name** on the **General** tab.|
|`IPResourceName`|The resource name for the IP address of the SQL Server FCI. In **Failover Cluster Manager** > **Roles**, under the SQL Server FCI role, under **Server Name**, right-click the IP address resource and select **Properties**. The correct value is under **Name** on the **General** tab.|
|`ILBIP`|The IP address of the internal load balancer. This address is configured in the Azure portal as the internal load balancer's frontend address. This is also the IP address of the SQL Server FCI. You can find it in **Failover Cluster Manager**, on the same properties page where you located the value for `IPResourceName`.|
|`ProbePort`|The probe port that you configured in the load balancer's health probe. Any unused TCP port is valid.|
|`SubnetMask`| The subnet mask for the cluster parameter. It must be the TCP/IP broadcast address: `255.255.255.255`.| 

After you set the cluster probe, you can see all the cluster parameters in PowerShell. Run this script:

```powershell
Get-ClusterResource $IPResourceName | Get-ClusterParameter
```

# [Public load balancer](#tab/elb)

Update the variables in the following script with values from your environment. Remove the angle brackets (`<` and `>`) from the script.

```powershell
$ClusterNetworkName = "<Cluster Network Name>"
$IPResourceName = "<SQL Server FCI IP Address Resource Name>" 
$ELBIP = "<n.n.n.n>" 
[int]$ProbePort = <nnnnn>

Import-Module FailoverClusters

Get-ClusterResource $IPResourceName | Set-ClusterParameter -Multiple @{"Address"="$ELBIP";"ProbePort"=$ProbePort;"SubnetMask"="255.255.255.255";"Network"="$ClusterNetworkName";"EnableDhcp"=0}
```

The following table describes the values that you need to update:

|**Variable**|**Value**|
|---------|---------|
|`ClusterNetworkName`| The name of the Windows Server failover cluster for the network. In **Failover Cluster Manager** > **Networks**, right-click the network and select **Properties**. The correct value is under **Name** on the **General** tab.|
|`IPResourceName`|The resource name for the IP address of the SQL Server FCI. In **Failover Cluster Manager** > **Roles**, under the SQL Server FCI role, under **Server Name**, right-click the IP address resource and select **Properties**. The correct value is under **Name** on the **General** tab.|
|`ELBIP`|The IP address of the external load balancer. This address is configured in the Azure portal as the frontend address of the external load balancer. It's used to connect to the public load balancer from external resources. |
|`ProbePort`|The probe port that you configured in the health probe of the load balancer. Any unused TCP port is valid.|
|`SubnetMask`| The subnet mask for the cluster parameter. It must be the TCP/IP broadcast address: `255.255.255.255`.| 

After you set the cluster probe, you can see all the cluster parameters in PowerShell. Run this script:

```powershell
Get-ClusterResource $IPResourceName | Get-ClusterParameter
```

> [!NOTE]
> Because there is no private IP address for the external load balancer, users can't directly use the VNN DNS name as it resolves the IP address within the subnet. Use the public IP address of the public load balancer, or configure another DNS mapping on the DNS server.

## Modify the connection string 

For clients that support it, add `MultiSubnetFailover=True` to the connection string. Although the `MultiSubnetFailover` connection option isn't required, it provides the benefit of a faster subnet failover. This is because the client driver tries to open a TCP socket for each IP address in parallel. The client driver waits for the first IP address to respond with success. After the successful response, the client driver uses that IP address for the connection. 

If your client doesn't support the `MultiSubnetFailover` parameter, you can modify the `RegisterAllProvidersIP` and `HostRecordTTL` settings to prevent connectivity delays upon failover. 

Use PowerShell to modify the `RegisterAllProvidersIp` and `HostRecordTTL` settings: 

```powershell
Get-ClusterResource yourFCIname | Set-ClusterParameter RegisterAllProvidersIP 0  
Get-ClusterResource yourFCIname | Set-ClusterParameter HostRecordTTL 300 
```

To learn more, see the [documentation about listener connection timeout in SQL Server](/troubleshoot/sql/availability-groups/listener-connection-times-out). 

> [!TIP]
> - Set the `MultiSubnetFailover` parameter to `true` in the connection string, even for HADR solutions that span a single subnet. This setting supports future spanning of subnets without the need to update connection strings.  
> - By default, clients cache cluster DNS records for 20 minutes. By reducing `HostRecordTTL`, you reduce the time to live (TTL) for the cached record. Legacy clients can then reconnect more quickly. As such, reducing the `HostRecordTTL` setting might increase traffic to the DNS servers.

## Test failover

Test failover of the clustered resource to validate cluster functionality:

1. Connect to one of the SQL Server cluster nodes by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
1. Open **Failover Cluster Manager**. Select **Roles**. Notice which node owns the SQL Server FCI role.
1. Right-click the SQL Server FCI role. 
1. Select **Move**, and then select **Best Possible Node**.

**Failover Cluster Manager** shows the role, and its resources go offline. The resources then move and come back online in the other node.

## Test connectivity

To test connectivity, sign in to another virtual machine in the same virtual network. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the SQL Server FCI name. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to, you can [download SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).
