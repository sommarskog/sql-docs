# Azure CLI script to enable transparent data encryption using your own key

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

This Azure CLI script example configures transparent data encryption (TDE) in Azure SQL Managed Instance, using a customer-managed key from Azure Key Vault. This is often referred to as a bring-your-own-key (BYOK) scenario for TDE. To learn more about TDE with customer-managed key, see [TDE Bring Your Own Key to Azure SQL](../../database/transparent-data-encryption-byok-overview.md).

This sample requires an existing managed instance, see [Use Azure CLI to create an Azure SQL Managed Instance](create-configure-managed-instance-cli.md).
