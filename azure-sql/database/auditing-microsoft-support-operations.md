# Auditing Microsoft support operations

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-asa](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-asa.md)]

Auditing of Microsoft support operations for your [logical server](logical-servers.md) in Azure SQL Database allows you to audit Microsoft support engineers' operations when they need to access your server during a support request. The use of this capability, along with your auditing, enables more transparency into your workforce and allows for anomaly detection, trend visualization, and data loss prevention.

## Enable auditing

To enable auditing of Microsoft support operations, Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).Navigate to **Auditing** under the **Security** heading in your Azure **SQL server** pane, and switch **Enable Auditing of Microsoft support operations** to **ON**.

To review the audit logs of Microsoft support operations in your Log Analytics workspace, use the following query:

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where Category == "DevOpsOperationsAudit"
```

You have the option of choosing a different storage destination for this auditing log, or use the same auditing configuration for your server.
