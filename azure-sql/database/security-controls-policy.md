[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance)
provides Microsoft created and managed initiative definitions, known as _built-ins_, for the
**compliance domains** and **security controls** related to different compliance standards. This
page lists the **compliance domains** and **security controls** for Azure SQL Database and SQL
Managed Instance. You can assign the built-ins for a **security control** individually to help make
your Azure resources compliant with the specific standard.
