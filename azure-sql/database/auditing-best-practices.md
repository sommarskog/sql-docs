# Auditing best practices for production environments

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-asa](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-asa.md)]

Here are some recommendations for using Azure SQL Auditing in production environments.

## Auditing for geo-replicated databases

With geo-replicated databases, the secondary database has an identical auditing policy to the primary database when enabling auditing on the primary database. It's also possible to set up auditing on the secondary database by enabling auditing on the **secondary server**, independently from the primary database.

- Server-level (**recommended**): Turn on auditing on both the **primary server** and the **secondary server** - the primary and secondary databases are audited independently based on their respective server-level policy.
- Database-level: Database-level auditing for secondary databases can only be configured from the primary database auditing settings.
  - Auditing must be enabled on the *primary database itself*, not the server.
  - After auditing is enabled on the primary database, it will also become enabled on the secondary database.

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > With database-level auditing, the storage settings for the secondary database will be identical to those of the primary database, causing cross-regional traffic. We recommend that you enable only server-level auditing, and leave the database-level auditing disabled for all databases.

## Storage key regeneration

In production, you're likely to refresh your storage keys periodically. When writing audit logs to Azure storage, you need to resave your auditing policy when refreshing your keys. The process is as follows:

1. Open **Advanced properties** under **Storage**. In the **Storage Access Key** section, select **Secondary**. Then select **Save** at the top of the auditing configuration page.

1. Go to the Azure **Storage account** that holds the key, and navigate to **Access keys**. Regenerate the primary access key.

1. Go back to the auditing configuration page, switch the storage access key from secondary to primary, and then select **OK**. Then select **Save** at the top of the auditing configuration page.
1. Go back to the storage configuration page and regenerate the secondary access key (in preparation for the next key's refresh cycle).
