# Use PowerShell to create a single database and configure a server-level firewall rule

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

This Azure PowerShell script example creates a single database in Azure SQL Database and configures a server-level firewall rule. After the script has been successfully run, the database can be accessed from all Azure services and the allowed IP address range.

If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires Az PowerShell 1.4.0 or later. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Sample script

[!code-powershell-interactive[main](~/../powershell_scripts/sql-database/create-and-configure-database/create-and-configure-database.ps1?highlight=15-16 "Create SQL Database")]

## Clean up deployment

Use the following command to remove  the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourcegroupname
```

| [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [New-AzSqlServer](/powershell/module/az.sql/new-azsqlserver) | Creates a server that hosts databases and elastic pools. |
| [New-AzSqlServerFirewallRule](/powershell/module/az.sql/new-azsqlserverfirewallrule) | Creates a server-level firewall rule for a server. |
| [New-AzSqlDatabase](/powershell/module/az.sql/new-azsqldatabase) | Creates a database in a server. |
| [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Configure managed identities

For more information on the benefits of using a user-assigned managed identity for the server identity in Azure SQL Database, see [User-assigned managed identity in Azure AD for Azure SQL](../authentication-azure-ad-user-assigned-managed-identity.md).

To configure the system-assigned managed identity (SMI) or user-assigned managed identity or identities (UMI) of an Azure SQL Database, see [Get or set a managed identity for a logical server or managed instance](../authentication-azure-ad-user-assigned-managed-identity.md#get-or-set-a-managed-identity-for-a-logical-server-or-managed-instance).
