# Azure Policy for Azure Active Directory only authentication with Azure SQL

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi.md)]

Azure Policy can enforce the creation of an Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance with [Azure AD-only authentication](authentication-azure-ad-only-authentication.md) enabled during provisioning. With this policy in place, any attempts to create a [logical server in Azure](logical-servers.md) or managed instance will fail if it isn't created with Azure AD-only authentication enabled.

The Azure Policy can be applied to the whole Azure subscription, or just within a resource group.

Two new built-in policies have been introduced in Azure Policy:

- Azure SQL Database should have Azure Active Directory Only Authentication enabled
- Azure SQL Managed Instance should have Azure Active Directory Only Authentication enabled

For more information on Azure Policy, see [What is Azure Policy?](/azure/governance/policy/overview) and [Azure Policy definition structure](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure).

## Permissions

For an overview of the permissions needed to manage Azure Policy, see [Azure RBAC permissions in Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview#azure-rbac-permissions-in-azure-policy).

### Actions

If you're using a custom role to manage Azure Policy, the following [Actions](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-definitions#actions) are needed.

- */read
- Microsoft.Authorization/policyassignments/*
- Microsoft.Authorization/policydefinitions/*
- Microsoft.Authorization/policyexemptions/*
- Microsoft.Authorization/policysetdefinitions/*
- Microsoft.PolicyInsights/*

For more information on custom roles, see [Azure custom roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles).

## Manage Azure Policy for Azure AD-only authentication

The Azure AD-only authentication policies can be managed by going to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and searching for the **Policy** service. Under **Definitions**, search for *Azure Active Directory only authentication*.

For a guide on how to add an Azure Policy for Azure AD-only authentication, see [Using Azure Policy to enforce Azure Active Directory only authentication with Azure SQL](authentication-azure-ad-only-authentication-policy-how-to.md).

There are three effects for these policies:

- **Audit** - The default setting, and will only capture an audit report in the Azure Policy activity logs
- **Deny** - Prevents logical server or managed instance creation without [Azure AD-only authentication](authentication-azure-ad-only-authentication.md) enabled
- **Disabled** - Will disable the policy, and won't restrict users from creating a logical server or managed instance without Azure AD-only authentication enabled

If the Azure Policy for Azure AD-only authentication is set to **Deny**, Azure SQL logical server or managed instance creation will fail. The details of this failure will be recorded in the **Activity log** of the resource group.

## Policy compliance

You can view the **Compliance** setting under the **Policy** service to see the compliance state. The **Compliance state** will tell you whether the server or managed instance is currently in compliance with having Azure AD-only authentication enabled. 

The Azure Policy can prevent a new logical server or managed instance from being created without having Azure AD-only authentication enabled, but the feature can be changed after server or managed instance creation. If a user has disabled Azure AD-only authentication after the server or managed instance was created, the compliance state will be `Non-compliant` if the Azure Policy is set to **Deny**.

## Limitations

- Azure Policy enforces Azure AD-only authentication during logical server or managed instance creation. Once the server is created, authorized Azure AD users with special roles (for example, SQL Security Manager) can disable the Azure AD-only authentication feature. The Azure Policy allows it, but in this case, the server or managed instance will be listed in the compliance report as `Non-compliant` and the report will indicate the server or managed instance name.
