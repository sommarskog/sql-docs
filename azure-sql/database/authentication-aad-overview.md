# Use Azure Active Directory authentication

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi-asa](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi-asa.md)]

This article provides an overview of using Azure Active Directory to authenticate to [Azure SQL Database](sql-database-paas-overview.md), [Azure SQL Managed Instance](../managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md), [SQL Server on Windows Azure VMs](../virtual-machines/windows/sql-server-on-azure-vm-iaas-what-is-overview.md), [Synapse SQL in Azure Synapse Analytics](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is) and [SQL Server for Windows and Linux](/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/azure-ad-authentication-sql-server-overview) by using identities in Azure AD.

To learn how to create and populate Azure AD, and then configure Azure AD with Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Synapse SQL in Azure Synapse Analytics, review [Configure Azure AD](authentication-aad-configure.md) and [Azure AD with SQL Server on Azure VMs](../virtual-machines/windows/configure-azure-ad-authentication-for-sql-vm.md).

## Overview

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication is a mechanism to connect to your SQL resource by using identities in Azure AD.

With Azure AD authentication, you can centrally manage the identities of database users and other Microsoft services in one central location. Central ID management provides a single place to manage database users and simplifies permission management. Benefits include the following:

- It provides an alternative to SQL Server authentication.
- It helps stop the proliferation of user identities across servers.
- It allows password rotation in a single place.
- Customers can manage database permissions using external (Azure AD) groups.
- It can eliminate storing passwords by enabling integrated Windows authentication and other forms of authentication supported by Azure Active Directory.
- Azure AD authentication uses contained database users to authenticate identities at the database level.
- Azure AD supports token-based authentication for applications connecting to SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance.
- Azure AD authentication supports:
  - Azure AD cloud-only identities.
  - Azure AD hybrid identities that support:
    - Cloud authentication with two options coupled with seamless single sign-on (SSO) **Pass-through** authentication and **password hash** authentication.
    - Federated authentication.
  - For more information on Azure AD authentication methods and which one to choose, see the following article:
    - [Choose the right authentication method for your Azure Active Directory hybrid identity solution](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/choose-ad-authn)

- Azure AD supports connections from SQL Server Management Studio that use Active Directory Universal Authentication, which includes Multi-Factor Authentication. Multi-Factor Authentication includes strong authentication with a range of easy verification options â€” phone call, text message, smart cards with pin, or mobile app notification. For more information, see [SSMS support for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication with Azure SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse](authentication-mfa-ssms-overview.md)

- Azure AD supports similar connections from SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) that use Active Directory Interactive Authentication. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory support in SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](/sql/ssdt/azure-active-directory)

The configuration steps include the following procedures to configure and use Azure Active Directory authentication.

1. Create and populate Azure AD.
1. Optional: Associate or change the active directory that is currently associated with your Azure Subscription.
1. Create an Azure Active Directory administrator.
1. Configure your client computers.
1. Create contained database users in your database mapped to Azure AD identities.
1. Connect to your database by using Azure AD identities.

> [!NOTE]  
> For Azure SQL, Azure VMs and SQL Server 2022, Azure AD authentication only supports access tokens which originate from Azure AD and doesn't support third-party access tokens. Azure AD also doesn't support redirecting Azure AD queries to third-party endpoints. This applies to all SQL platforms and all operating systems that support Azure AD authentication.

## Trust architecture

- Only the cloud portion of Azure AD, SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance, [SQL Server on Windows Azure VMs](../virtual-machines/windows/configure-azure-ad-authentication-for-sql-vm.md), and Azure Synapse is considered to support Azure AD native user passwords.
- To support Windows single sign-on credentials (or user/password for Windows credential), use Azure Active Directory credentials from a federated or managed domain that is configured for seamless single sign-on for pass-through and password hash authentication. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory seamless single sign-on](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sso).
- To support Federated authentication (or user/password for Windows credentials), the communication with ADFS block is required.

For more information on Azure AD hybrid identities, the setup, and synchronization, see the following articles:

- Password hash authentication - [Implement password hash synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization)
- Pass-through authentication - [Azure Active Directory Pass-through Authentication](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-pta-quick-start)
- Federated authentication - [Deploying Active Directory Federation Services in Azure](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs) and [Azure AD Connect and federation](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-whatis)

For a sample federated authentication with ADFS infrastructure (or user/password for Windows credentials), see the diagram below. The arrows indicate communication pathways.

The following diagram indicates the federation, trust, and hosting relationships that allow a client to connect to a database by submitting a token. The token is authenticated by an Azure AD, and is trusted by the database. Customer 1 can represent an Azure Active Directory with native users or an Azure AD with federated users. Customer 2 represents a possible solution including imported users, in this example coming from a federated Azure Active Directory with ADFS being synchronized with Azure Active Directory. It's important to understand that access to a database using Azure AD authentication requires that the hosting subscription is associated to the Azure AD. The same subscription must be used to create the Azure SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance, or Azure Synapse resources.

## Administrator structure

When using Azure AD authentication, there are two Administrator accounts: the original Azure SQL Database administrator and the Azure AD administrator. The same concepts apply to Azure Synapse. Only the administrator based on an Azure AD account can create the first Azure AD contained database user in a user database. The Azure AD administrator login can be an Azure AD user or an Azure AD group. When the administrator is a group account, it can be used by any group member, enabling multiple Azure AD administrators for the server. Using group account as an administrator enhances manageability by allowing you to centrally add and remove group members in Azure AD without changing the users or permissions in SQL Database or Azure Synapse. Only one Azure AD administrator (a user or group) can be configured at any time.

![admin structure][3]

> [!NOTE]  
> Azure AD authentication with Azure SQL supports only a single Azure AD tenant where the Azure SQL resource currently resides. All Azure AD objects from this tenant can be set up as users allowing access to Azure SQL in this tenant. Only an Azure AD admin from this tenant can be configured to enable access to Azure SQL in this tenant . Azure AD multi-tenant authentication accessing Azure SQL from different tenants are not supported. Multi-tenant Azure AD admins cannot be set up for an Azure SQL resource.

## Permissions

To create new users, you must have the `ALTER ANY USER` permission in the database. The `ALTER ANY USER` permission can be granted to any database user. The `ALTER ANY USER` permission is also held by the server administrator accounts, and database users with the `CONTROL ON DATABASE` or `ALTER ON DATABASE` permission for that database, and by members of the `db_owner` database role.

To create a contained database user in Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, or Azure Synapse, you must connect to the database or instance using an Azure AD identity. To create the first contained database user, you must connect to the database by using an Azure AD administrator (who is the owner of the database). This is demonstrated in [Configure and manage Azure Active Directory authentication with SQL Database or Azure Synapse](authentication-aad-configure.md). Azure AD authentication is only possible if the Azure AD admin was created for Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, or Azure Synapse. If the Azure Active Directory admin was removed from the server, existing Azure Active Directory users created previously inside SQL Server can no longer connect to the database using their Azure Active Directory credentials.

## Azure AD features and limitations

- The following members of Azure AD can be provisioned for Azure SQL Database:

  - Native members: A member created in Azure AD in the managed domain or in a customer domain. For more information, see [Add your own domain name to Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-custom-domain).
  - Members of an Active Directory domain federated with Azure Active Directory on a managed domain configured for seamless single sign-on with pass-through or password hash authentication. For more information, see [Federation with Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/connect/whatis-fed) and [Azure Active Directory seamless single sign-on](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sso).
  - Imported members from other Azure ADs who are native or federated domain members.
  - Active Directory groups created as security groups.

- Azure AD users that are part of a group that is member of the `db_owner` database role cannot use the **[CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-database-scoped-credential-transact-sql)** syntax against Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse. You'll see the following error:

    `SQL Error [2760] [S0001]: The specified schema name 'user@mydomain.com' either doesn't exist or you do not have permission to use it.`

    To mitigate the **CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL** issue add the individual Azure AD user the `db_owner` role directly.

- These system functions aren't supported and return NULL values when executed under Azure AD principals:

  - `SUSER_ID()`
  - `SUSER_NAME(<ID>)`
  - `SUSER_SNAME(<SID>)`
  - `SUSER_ID(<name>)`
  - `SUSER_SID(<name>)`

- Azure SQL Database doesn't create implicit users for users logged in as part of an Azure AD group membership. Because of this, various operations that require assigning ownership will fail, even if the Azure AD group is added as a member to a role with those permissions.

   For example, a user signed into a database via an Azure AD group with the **db_ddladmin** role, will not be able to execute CREATE SCHEMA, ALTER SCHEMA, and other object creation statements without a schema explicitly defined (such as table, view, or type, for example). To resolve this, an Azure AD user must be created for that user, or the Azure AD group must be altered to assign the DEFAULT_SCHEMA to **dbo**.

### SQL Managed Instance

- Azure AD server principals (logins) and users are supported for [SQL Managed Instance](../managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md).
- Setting Azure AD server principals (logins) mapped to an Azure AD group as database owner isn't supported in [SQL Managed Instance](../managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md).

  - An extension of this is that when a group is added as part of the `dbcreator` server role, users from this group can connect to the SQL Managed Instance and create new databases, but won't be able to access the database. This is because the new database owner is SA, and not the Azure AD user. This issue doesn't manifest if the individual user is added to the `dbcreator` server role.

- SQL Agent management and jobs execution are supported for Azure AD server principals (logins).
- Database backup and restore operations can be executed by Azure AD server principals (logins).
- Auditing of all statements related to Azure AD server principals (logins) and authentication events is supported.
- Dedicated administrator connection for Azure AD server principals (logins) which are members of sysadmin server role is supported.
  - Supported through SQLCMD Utility and SQL Server Management Studio.
- Logon triggers are supported for logon events coming from Azure AD server principals (logins).
- Service Broker and DB mail can be setup using an Azure AD server principal (login).

## Connect by using Azure AD identities

Azure Active Directory authentication supports the following methods of connecting to a database using Azure AD identities:

- Azure Active Directory Password
- Azure Active Directory Integrated
- Azure Active Directory Universal with Multi-Factor Authentication
- Using Application token authentication

The following authentication methods are supported for Azure AD server principals (logins):

- Azure Active Directory Password
- Azure Active Directory Integrated
- Azure Active Directory Universal with Multi-Factor Authentication

### Additional considerations

- To enhance manageability, we recommend you provision a dedicated Azure AD group as an administrator.
- Only one Azure AD administrator (a user or group) can be configured for a server in SQL Database or Azure Synapse at any time.
  - The addition of Azure AD server principals (logins) for SQL Managed Instance allows the possibility of creating multiple Azure AD server principals (logins) that can be added to the `sysadmin` role.
- Only an Azure AD administrator for the server can initially connect to the server or managed instance using an Azure Active Directory account. The Active Directory administrator can configure subsequent Azure AD database users.
- Azure AD users and service principals (Azure AD applications) that are members of more than 2048 Azure AD security groups aren't supported to login into the database in SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance, or Azure Synapse.
- We recommend setting the connection timeout to 30 seconds.
- SQL Server 2016 Management Studio and SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2015 (version 14.0.60311.1April 2016 or later) support Azure Active Directory authentication. (Azure AD authentication is supported by the **.NET Framework Data Provider for SqlServer**; at least version .NET Framework 4.6). Therefore the newest versions of these tools and data-tier applications (DAC and BACPAC) can use Azure AD authentication.
- Beginning with version 15.0.1, [sqlcmd utility](/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility) and [bcp utility](/sql/tools/bcp-utility) support Active Directory Interactive authentication with Multi-Factor Authentication.
- SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2015 requires at least the April 2016 version of the Data Tools (version 14.0.60311.1). Currently, Azure AD users aren't shown in SSDT Object Explorer. As a workaround, view the users in [sys.database_principals](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-database-principals-transact-sql).
- [Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=11774) supports Azure AD authentication. Also, see [Setting the Connection Properties](/sql/connect/jdbc/setting-the-connection-properties).
- PolyBase cannot authenticate by using Azure AD authentication.
- Azure AD authentication is supported for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse by using the Azure portal **Import Database** and **Export Database** blades. Import and export using Azure AD authentication is also supported from a PowerShell command.
- Azure AD authentication is supported for SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse with using the CLI. For more information, see [Configure and manage Azure AD authentication with SQL Database or Azure Synapse](authentication-aad-configure.md) and [SQL Server - az sql server](/cli/azure/sql/server).
