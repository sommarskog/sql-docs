> [!NOTE]
> SQL Server VMs deployed via the Azure marketplace after October 2022 have the [least privileged model](../virtual-machines/windows/sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#permissions-models) enabled by default. 
> [Management modes](../virtual-machines/windows/sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-automate-management.md#management-modes) for the SQL IaaS Agent extension were removed in March 2023.
