> [!NOTE]
> Azure has two different deployment models you can use to create and work with resources: [Azure Resource Manager and classic](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/deployment-models). This article covers the use of the Resource Manager deployment model. We recommend the Resource Manager deployment model for new deployments instead of the classic deployment model.
