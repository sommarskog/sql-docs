# SQL Statements Entered by the User
Applications that perform ad hoc analysis also commonly allow the user to enter SQL statements directly. For example:  
  
```  
SQLCHAR *     Statement, SqlState[6], Msg[SQL_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH];  
SQLSMALLINT   i, MsgLen;  
SQLINTEGER    NativeError;  
SQLRETURN     rc1, rc2;  
  
// Prompt user for SQL statement.  
GetSQLStatement(Statement);  
  
// Execute the statement directly. Because it will be executed only once,  
// do not prepare it.  
rc1 = SQLExecDirect(hstmt, Statement, SQL_NTS);  
  
// Process any errors or returned information.  
if ((rc1 == SQL_ERROR) || rc1 == SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO) {  
   i = 1;  
   while ((rc2 = SQLGetDiagRec(SQL_HANDLE_STMT, hstmt, i, SqlState, &NativeError,  
         Msg, sizeof(Msg), &MsgLen)) != SQL_NO_DATA) {  
      DisplayError(SqlState, NativeError, Msg, MsgLen);  
      i++;  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 This approach simplifies application coding; the application relies on the user to build the SQL statement and on the data source to check the statement's validity. Because it's difficult to write a graphical user interface that adequately exposes the intricacies of SQL, simply asking the user to enter the SQL statement text may be a preferable alternative. However, this requires the user to know not only SQL but also the schema of the data source being queried. Some applications provide a graphical user interface by which the user can create a basic SQL statement and also provide a text interface with which the user can modify it.
