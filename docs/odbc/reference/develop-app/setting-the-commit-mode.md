# Setting the Commit Mode
Applications specify the transaction mode with the SQL_ATTR_AUTOCOMMIT connection attribute. By default, ODBC transactions are in auto-commit mode (unless **SQLSetConnectAttr** and **SQLSetConnectOption** are not supported, which is unlikely). Switching from manual-commit mode to auto-commit mode automatically commits any open transaction on the connection.
