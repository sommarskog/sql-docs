# Features to Watch For
This section describes a number of features that application developers often take for granted. In fact, these features vary widely in support and manner of support among DBMSs; failure to code for them is likely to cause problems in interoperable applications.  
  
 This section does not list all features that application developers need to consider. For that information, see the [SQLGetInfo](../../../odbc/reference/syntax/sqlgetinfo-function.md), [SQLSetStmtAttr](../../../odbc/reference/syntax/sqlsetstmtattr-function.md), and [SQLSetConnectAttr](../../../odbc/reference/syntax/sqlsetconnectattr-function.md) function descriptions, [Appendix C: SQL Grammar](../../../odbc/reference/appendixes/appendix-c-sql-grammar.md), and the sections of this manual that discuss each feature.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Version Number](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/version-number.md)  
  
-   [Multiple Active Statements and Connections](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/multiple-active-statements-and-connections.md)  
  
-   [Transaction Support in DBMSs](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/transaction-support-in-dbmss.md)  
  
-   [Commit and Rollback Behavior](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/commit-and-rollback-behavior.md)  
  
-   [NOT NULL in CREATE TABLE Statements](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/not-null-in-create-table-statements.md)  
  
-   [Supported Data Types](../../../odbc/microsoft/supported-data-types-odbc-driver-for-oracle.md)  
  
-   [ODBC SQL Grammar](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/odbc-sql-grammar.md)  
  
-   [Batch Processing](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/batch-processing.md)
