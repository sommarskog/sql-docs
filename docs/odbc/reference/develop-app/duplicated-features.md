# Duplicated Features
The following ODBC *2.x* functions have been duplicated by ODBC *3.x* functions. As a result, the ODBC *2.x* functions are deprecated in ODBC *3.x*. The ODBC *3.x* functions are referred to as replacement functions.  
  
 When an application uses a deprecated ODBC *2.x* function and the underlying driver is an ODBC *3.x* driver, the Driver Manager maps the function call to the corresponding replacement function. The only exception to this rule is **SQLExtendedFetch**. (See the footnote at the end of the following table.) For more information about these mappings, see [Mapping Deprecated Functions](../../../odbc/reference/appendixes/mapping-deprecated-functions.md) in Appendix G: Driver Guidelines for Backward Compatibility.  
  
 When an application uses a replacement function and the underlying driver is an ODBC *2.x* driver, the Driver Manager maps the function call to the corresponding deprecated function.  
  
|ODBC *2.x* function|ODBC *3.x* function|  
|-------------------------|-------------------------|  
|**SQLAllocConnect**|**SQLAllocHandle**|  
|**SQLAllocEnv**|**SQLAllocHandle**|  
|**SQLAllocStmt**|**SQLAllocHandle**|  
|**SQLColAttributes**|**SQLColAttribute**|  
|**SQLError**|**SQLGetDiagRec**|  
|**SQLExtendedFetch**[1]|**SQLFetchScroll**|  
|**SQLFreeConnect**|**SQLFreeHandle**|

 [1]   The function **SQLExtendedFetch** is duplicated functionality; **SQLFetchScroll** provides the same functionality in ODBC *3.x*. However, the Driver Manager does not map **SQLExtendedFetch** to **SQLFetchScroll** when going against an ODBC *3.x* driver. For more information, see [What the Driver Manager Does](../../../odbc/reference/appendixes/what-the-driver-manager-does.md) in Appendix G: Driver Guidelines for Backward Compatibility. The Driver Manager maps **SQLFetchScroll** to **SQLExtendedFetch** when going against an ODBC *2.x* driver.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The function **SQLBindParam** is a special case. **SQLBindParam** is duplicated functionality. This is not an ODBC *2.x* function, but a function that is present in the Open Group and ISO standards. The functionality provided by this function is completely subsumed by that of **SQLBindParameter**. As a result, the Driver Manager maps a call to **SQLBindParam** to **SQLBindParameter** when the underlying driver is an ODBC *3.x* driver. However, when the underlying driver is an ODBC *2.x* driver, the Driver Manager does not perform this mapping.
