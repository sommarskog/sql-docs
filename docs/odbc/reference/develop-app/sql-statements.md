# SQL Statements
ODBC applications perform almost all database access by executing SQL statements. The form of these statements - hard-coded or constructed at run time, interoperable or data source-specific, and so on - depends on the needs of the application.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Constructing SQL Statements](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/constructing-sql-statements.md)  
  
-   [Interoperability of SQL Statements](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/interoperability-of-sql-statements.md)  
  
-   [Escape Sequences in ODBC](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/escape-sequences-in-odbc.md)
