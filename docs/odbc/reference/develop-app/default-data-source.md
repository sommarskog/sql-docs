# Default Data Source
The driver may select a data source, called the default data source, in certain cases where the application does not explicitly specify one:  
  
-   In a call to **SQLConnect** where the *ServerName* argument is a zero-length string, a null pointer, or DEFAULT.  
  
-   In a call to **SQLDriverConnect** where *InConnectionString* either specifies **DSN**=DEFAULT or specifies with the **DSN** keyword a data source that is not contained in the system information.  
  
 It is driver-defined how the default data source is specified. This may involve administrative action and may depend on the user.
