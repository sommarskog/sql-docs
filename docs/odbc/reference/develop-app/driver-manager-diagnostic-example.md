# Driver Manager Diagnostic Example
The Driver Manager can also generate diagnostic messages. For example, if an application passed an invalid direction option to **SQLDataSources**, the Driver Manager might format and return the following values from **SQLGetDiagRec**:  
  
```  
SQLSTATE:         "HY103"  
Native Error:      0  
Diagnostic Msg:   "[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager]Direction option out of range"  
```  
  
 Because the error occurred in the Driver Manager, it added prefixes to the diagnostic message for its vendor ([Microsoft]) and its identifier ([ODBC Driver Manager]).
