# Types of Drivers
ODBC drivers can be classified as follows:  
  
-   **32-bit ODBC 2.**  
     **_x_ Driver** A 32-bit driver that:  
  
    -   Exports only ODBC *2.x* functions.  
  
    -   Exhibits ODBC *2.x* behavior for behavioral changes.  
  
-   **ISO and Open Group-Compliant Driver** A 32-bit driver that:  
  
    -   Exports all functions that are documented in the Open Group or ISO CLI documents. This will include some of functions that are deprecated in ODBC.  
  
    -   Exhibits ODBC 3.0 behavior for behavioral changes.  
  
    -   Does not necessarily go through the ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager.  
  
-   **ODBC 3.0 Driver** A 32-bit driver that:  
  
    -   Exports only functions that are in ODBC 3.0 minus deprecated functions.  
  
    -   Is capable of exhibiting ODBC *2.x* behavior or ODBC 3.0 behavior with respect to behavioral changes, based on the SQL_ATTR_APP_ODBC_VERSION environment attribute.  
  
-   **ODBC 3.5 (or later) ANSI Driver** A 32-bit driver that:  
  
    -   Exports only functions that are in ODBC 3.5 minus deprecated functions.  
  
    -   Is capable of exhibiting ODBC *2.x* behavior or ODBC 3.0 behavior, or ODBC 3.5 behavior with respect to behavioral changes, based on the SQL_ATTR_APP_ODBC_VERSION environment attribute.  
  
-   **ODBC 3.5 (or later) Unicode Driver** A 32-bit driver that:  
  
    -   Supports all the features of an ODBC 3.5 ANSI driver.  
  
    -   Exports Unicode versions of all ODBC string APIs.  
  
    -   Can store and process Unicode data on the data source.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  16-bit ODBC drivers will not work directly with the ODBC *3.x* Driver Manager. However, it is possible for 16-bit drivers to work with the 2.0 ODBC Driver Manager, which subsequently thunks up to the *3.x* Driver Manager.
