# State Transition Checks
The Driver Manager checks that the state of the environment, connection, or statement is appropriate for the function being called. For example, a connection must be in an allocated state when **SQLConnect** is called; a statement must be in a prepared state when **SQLExecute** is called. The Driver Manager returns SQL_ERROR for state transition errors.
