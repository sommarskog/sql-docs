# Calling SQLCloseCursor
Because **SQLCloseCursor** is almost the same as **SQLFreeStmt** with SQL_CLOSE, the Driver Manager does not map this function. Replacement functions are mapped so that existing ODBC *2.x* applications can easily move to ODBC *3.x* by using the new functions. Such a move makes it easier for such applications to begin using new ODBC *3.x* functionality inside of conditional code in a modular fashion. **SQLCloseCursor** does not represent any new functionality. An application does not gain any advantage by moving to **SQLCloseCursor** from **SQLFreeStmt** with SQL_CLOSE.
