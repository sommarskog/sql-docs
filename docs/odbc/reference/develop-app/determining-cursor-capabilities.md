# Determining Cursor Capabilities
The following four options in **SQLGetInfo** describe what types of cursors are supported and what their capabilities are:  
  
-   SQL_CURSOR_SENSITIVITY. Indicates whether a cursor is sensitive to changes made by another cursor.  
  
-   SQL_SCROLL_OPTIONS. Lists the supported cursor types (forward-only, static, keyset-driven, dynamic, or mixed). All data sources must support forward-only cursors.  
  
-   SQL_DYNAMIC_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES1, SQL_FORWARD_ONLY_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES1, SQL_KEYSET_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES1, or SQL_STATIC_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES1 (depending on the type of the cursor). Lists the fetch types supported by scrollable cursors. The bits in the return value correspond to the fetch types in **SQLFetchScroll**.  
  
-   SQL_KEYSET_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES2 or SQL_STATIC_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES2 (depending on the type of the cursor). Lists whether static and keyset-driven cursors can detect their own updates, deletes, and inserts.  
  
 An application can determine cursor capabilities at run time by calling **SQLGetInfo** with these options. This is commonly done by generic applications. Cursor capabilities also can be determined during application development and their use hard-coded into the application. This is commonly done by vertical and custom applications but can also be done by generic applications that use a client-side cursor implementation such as the ODBC cursor library.
