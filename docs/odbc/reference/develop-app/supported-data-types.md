# Supported Data Types
The data types supported by DBMSs vary considerably. An application can determine the names and characteristics of supported data types by calling **SQLGetTypeInfo**. Because of wide variation in data type names, the application must use the data type names returned by **SQLGetTypeInfo** in **CREATE TABLE** statements. For more information, see [Data Types in ODBC](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/data-types-in-odbc.md).
