# Header Record
The fields in the header record contain general information about a function's execution, including the return code, row count, number of status records, and type of statement executed. The header record is always created unless the function returns SQL_INVALID_HANDLE. For a complete list of fields in the header record, see the [SQLGetDiagField](../../../odbc/reference/syntax/sqlgetdiagfield-function.md) function description.
