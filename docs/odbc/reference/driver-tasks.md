# Driver Tasks
Specific tasks performed by drivers include:  
  
-   Connecting to and disconnecting from the data source.  
  
-   Checking for function errors not checked by the Driver Manager.  
  
-   Initiating transactions; this is transparent to the application.  
  
-   Submitting SQL statements to the data source for execution. The driver must modify ODBC SQL to DBMS-specific SQL; this is often limited to replacing escape clauses defined by ODBC with DBMS-specific SQL.  
  
-   Sending data to and retrieving data from the data source, including converting data types as specified by the application.  
  
-   Mapping DBMS-specific errors to ODBC SQLSTATEs.
