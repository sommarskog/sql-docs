# Fixed-Length Bookmarks
If an ODBC *3.x* driver should work with an ODBC *2.x* application that uses fixed-length bookmarks, the driver must support the following:  
  
-   SQL_UB_ON as a value for the SQL_USE_BOOKMARKS statement option. (SQL_UB_ON is deprecated in ODBC *3.x*.)  
  
-   The SQL_GET_BOOKMARK statement option.
