# Loading by Ordinal
In ODBC *2.x*, loading by ordinal could be performed to improve the performance of the connection process. An ODBC *2.x* driver exports a dummy function with the ordinal 199; when the Driver Manager detects it, it resolves the addresses of the ODBC functions by ordinal, not by name. This functionality is still supported for ODBC *2.x* drivers but is not supported for ODBC *3.x* drivers.
