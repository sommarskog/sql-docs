# Interval Escape Sequences
ODBC uses escape sequences for interval literals. The syntax of this escape sequence is as follows:  
  
 {*interval-literal*}  
  
 For the BNF syntax of *interval-literal*, see the [Interval Literal Syntax](../../../odbc/reference/appendixes/interval-literal-syntax.md) section later in this appendix.  
  
 The interval literal escape sequence is supported if the interval data types are supported by the data source. An application should call **SQLGetTypeInfo** to determine whether these data types are supported.
