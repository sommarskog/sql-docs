# SQL_C_TCHAR
The SQL_C_TCHAR type identifier does not actually identify a data type; it is a macro that exists within the header file for Unicode conversion. It is replaced by SQL_C_CHAR or SQL_C_WCHAR depending on the setting of the UNICODE **#define**. It is useful for an application transferring character data that is compiled as both an ANSI and a Unicode application.
