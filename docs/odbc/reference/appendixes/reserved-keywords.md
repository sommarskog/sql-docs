# Reserved Keywords
The following words are reserved for use in ODBC function calls. These words do not constrain the minimum SQL grammar; however, to ensure compatibility with drivers that support the core SQL grammar, applications should avoid using any of these keywords. The #**define** value SQL_ODBC_KEYWORDS contains a comma-separated list of these keywords.
