# Data Type Support
ODBC drivers must support at least one of SQL_CHAR and SQL_VARCHAR. Support for other data types is determined by the driver's or data source's SQL-92 conformance level. An application should call **SQLGetTypeInfo** to determine the data types supported by the driver.  
  
 For more information on data types, see [Appendix D: Data Types](../../../odbc/reference/appendixes/appendix-d-data-types.md).
