# SQLAllocStmt Mapping
When an application calls **SQLAllocStmt** through an ODBC *3.x* driver, the call to:  
  
```  
SQLAllocStmt(hdbc, phstmt)  
```  
  
 is mapped to **SQLAllocHandle** by the Driver Manager in the driver as follows:  
  
```  
SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_STMT, InputHandle, OutputHandlePtr)  
```  
  
 with *InputHandle* set to *hdbc* and *OutputHandlePtr* set to *phstmt*.
