# SQLGetInfo Function

**Conformance**  
 Version Introduced: ODBC 1.0 Standards Compliance: ISO 92  
  
 **Summary**  
 **SQLGetInfo** returns general information about the driver and data source associated with a connection.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
  
SQLRETURN SQLGetInfo(  
     SQLHDBC         ConnectionHandle,  
     SQLUSMALLINT    InfoType,  
     SQLPOINTER      InfoValuePtr,  
     SQLSMALLINT     BufferLength,  
     SQLSMALLINT *   StringLengthPtr);  
```  
  
## Arguments  

 *ConnectionHandle*  
 [Input] Connection handle.  
  
 *InfoType*  
 [Input] Type of information.  
  
 *InfoValuePtr*  
 [Output] Pointer to a buffer in which to return the information. Depending on the *InfoType* requested, the information returned will be one of the following: a null-terminated character string, an SQLUSMALLINT value, an SQLUINTEGER bitmask, an SQLUINTEGER flag, a SQLUINTEGER binary value, or a SQLULEN value.  
  
 If the *InfoType* argument is SQL_DRIVER_HDESC or SQL_DRIVER_HSTMT, the *InfoValuePtr* argument is both input and output. (See the SQL_DRIVER_HDESC or SQL_DRIVER_HSTMT descriptors later in this function description for more information.)  
  
 If *InfoValuePtr* is NULL, *StringLengthPtr* will still return the total number of bytes (excluding the null-termination character for character data) available to return in the buffer pointed to by *InfoValuePtr*.  
  
 *BufferLength*  
 [Input] Length of the \**InfoValuePtr* buffer. If the value in *\*InfoValuePtr* is not a character string or if *InfoValuePtr* is a null pointer, the *BufferLength* argument is ignored. The driver assumes that the size of *\*InfoValuePtr* is SQLUSMALLINT or SQLUINTEGER, based on the *InfoType*. If *\*InfoValuePtr* is a Unicode string (when calling **SQLGetInfoW**), the *BufferLength* argument must be an even number; if not, SQLSTATE HY090 (Invalid string or buffer length) is returned.  
  
 *StringLengthPtr*  
 [Output] Pointer to a buffer in which to return the total number of bytes (excluding the null-termination character for character data) available to return in **InfoValuePtr*.  
  
 For character data, if the number of bytes available to return is greater than or equal to *BufferLength*, the information in \**InfoValuePtr* is truncated to *BufferLength* bytes minus the length of a null-termination character and is null-terminated by the driver.  
  
 For all other types of data, the value of *BufferLength* is ignored and the driver assumes the size of \**InfoValuePtr* is SQLUSMALLINT or SQLUINTEGER, depending on the *InfoType*.  
  
## Returns  

 SQL_SUCCESS, SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, SQL_ERROR, or SQL_INVALID_HANDLE.  
  
## Diagnostics  

 When **SQLGetInfo** returns either SQL_ERROR or SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, an associated SQLSTATE value can be obtained by calling **SQLGetDiagRec** with a *HandleType* of SQL_HANDLE_DBC and a *Handle* of *ConnectionHandle*. The following table lists the SQLSTATE values typically returned by **SQLGetInfo** and explains each one in the context of this function; the notation "(DM)" precedes the descriptions of SQLSTATEs returned by the Driver Manager. The return code associated with each SQLSTATE value is SQL_ERROR, unless noted otherwise.  
  
|SQLSTATE|Error|Description|  
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|  
|01000|General warning|Driver-specific informational message. (Function returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO.)|  
|01004|String data, right truncated|The buffer \**InfoValuePtr* was not large enough to return all the requested information. Therefore, the information was truncated. The length of the requested information in its untruncated form is returned in **StringLengthPtr*. (Function returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO.)|  
|08003|Connection not open|(DM) The type of information requested in *InfoType* requires an open connection. Of the information types reserved by ODBC, only SQL_ODBC_VER can be returned without an open connection.|  
|08S01|Communication link failure|The communication link between the driver and the data source to which the driver was connected failed before the function completed processing.|  
|HY000|General error|An error occurred for which there was no specific SQLSTATE and for which no implementation-specific SQLSTATE was defined. The error message returned by **SQLGetDiagRec** in the *\*MessageText* buffer describes the error and its cause.|  
|HY001|Memory allocation error|The driver was unable to allocate memory that is required to support execution or completion of the function.|  
|HY010|Function sequence error|(DM) **SQLExecute**, **SQLExecDirect**, or **SQLMoreResults** was called for the *StatementHandle* and returned SQL_PARAM_DATA_AVAILABLE. This function was called before data was retrieved for all streamed parameters.|  
|HY013|Memory management error|The function call could not be processed because the underlying memory objects could not be accessed, possibly because of low memory conditions.|  
|HY024|Invalid attribute value|(DM) The *InfoType* argument was SQL_DRIVER_HSTMT, and the value pointed to by *InfoValuePtr* was not a valid statement handle.<br /><br /> (DM) The *InfoType* argument was SQL_DRIVER_HDESC, and the value pointed to by *InfoValuePtr* was not a valid descriptor handle.|  
|HY090|Invalid string or buffer length|(DM) The value specified for argument *BufferLength* was less than 0.<br /><br /> (DM) The value specified for *BufferLength* was an odd number, and *\*InfoValuePtr* was of a Unicode data type.|  
|HY096|Information type out of range|The value specified for the argument *InfoType* was not valid for the version of ODBC supported by the driver.|  
|HY117|Connection is suspended due to unknown transaction state. Only disconnect and read-only functions are allowed.|(DM) For more information about suspended state, see [SQLEndTran Function](sqlendtran-function.md).|  
|HYC00|Optional field not implemented|The value specified for the argument *InfoType* was a driver-specific value that is not supported by the driver.|  
|HYT01|Connection timeout expired|The connection timeout period expired before the data source responded to the request. The connection timeout period is set through **SQLSetConnectAttr**, SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT.|  
|IM001|Driver does not support this function|(DM) The driver that corresponds to the *ConnectionHandle* does not support the function.|  
  
## Comments  

 The currently defined information types are shown in "Information Types," later in this section; it is expected that more will be defined to take advantage of different data sources. A range of information types is reserved by ODBC; driver developers must reserve values for their own driver-specific use from Open Group. **SQLGetInfo** performs no Unicode conversion or *thunking* (see [Appendix A: ODBC Error Codes](../appendixes/appendix-a-odbc-error-codes.md) of the *ODBC Programmer's Reference*) for driver-defined *InfoTypes*. For more information, see [Driver-Specific Data Types, Descriptor Types, Information Types, Diagnostic Types, and Attributes](../develop-app/driver-specific-data-types-descriptor-information-diagnostic.md). The format of the information returned in \**InfoValuePtr* depends on the *InfoType* requested. **SQLGetInfo** will return information in one of five different formats:  
  
- A null-terminated character string  
  
- An SQLUSMALLINT value  
  
- An SQLUINTEGER bitmask  
  
- An SQLUINTEGER value  
  
- A SQLUINTEGER binary value  
  
 The format of each of the following information types is noted in the type's description. The application must cast the value returned in **InfoValuePtr* accordingly. For an example of how an application could retrieve data from a SQLUINTEGER bitmask, see "Code Example."  
  
 A driver must return a value for each information type that is defined in the following tables. If an information type does not apply to the driver or data source, the driver returns one of the values listed in the following table.  

|Information type|Value|
|-|-|
|Character string ("Y" or "N")|"N"|
|Character string (not "Y" or "N")|Empty string|
|SQLUSMALLINT|0|
|SQLUINTEGER bitmask or SQLUINTEGER binary value|0L|
  
 For example, if a data source does not support procedures, **SQLGetInfo** returns the values listed in the following table for the values of *InfoType* that are related to procedures.  

|InfoType|Value|
|-|-|
|SQL_PROCEDURES|"N"|
|SQL_ACCESSIBLE_PROCEDURES|"N"|
|SQL_MAX_PROCEDURE_NAME_LEN|0|
|SQL_PROCEDURE_TERM|Empty string|
  
 **SQLGetInfo** returns SQLSTATE HY096 (Invalid argument value) for values of *InfoType* that are in the range of information types reserved for use by ODBC but are not defined by the version of ODBC supported by the driver. To determine what version of ODBC a driver complies with, an application calls **SQLGetInfo** with the SQL_DRIVER_ODBC_VER information type. **SQLGetInfo** returns SQLSTATE HYC00 (Optional feature not implemented) for values of *InfoType* that are in the range of information types reserved for driver-specific use but are not supported by the driver.  
  
 All calls to **SQLGetInfo** require an open connection, except when the *InfoType* is SQL_ODBC_VER, which returns the version of the Driver Manager.

## Supported SQL  

 The following values of the *InfoType* argument return information about the SQL statements supported by the data source. The SQL syntax of each feature described by these information types is the SQL-92 syntax. These information types do not exhaustively describe the entire SQL-92 grammar. Instead, they describe those parts of the grammar for which data sources typically offer different levels of support. Specifically, most of the DDL statements in SQL-92 are covered.  
  
 Applications should determine the general level of supported grammar from the SQL_SQL_CONFORMANCE information type and use the other information types to determine variations from the stated standards compliance level.

## Information Type Descriptions  

The following table alphabetically lists each information type, the version of ODBC in which it was introduced, and its description.  
  
|Information Type|ODBC Version|Description|
|-|-|-|
|SQL_ACCESSIBLE_PROCEDURES|1.0|A character string: "Y" if the user can execute all procedures returned by **SQLProcedures**; "N" if there may be procedures returned that the user cannot execute.|

|SQL_DATA_SOURCE_READ_ONLY|1.0|A character string. "Y" if the data source is set to READ ONLY mode, "N" if it is otherwise.<br/><br/>This characteristic pertains only to the data source itself; it is not a characteristic of the driver that enables access to the data source.

|SQL_DEFAULT_TXN_ISOLATION|1.0|An SQLUINTEGER value that indicates the default transaction isolation level supported by the driver or data source, or zero if the data source does not support transactions. The following terms are used to define transaction isolation levels:<br/>**Dirty Read** Transaction 1 changes a row. Transaction 2 reads the changed row before transaction 1 commits the change. If transaction 1 rolls back the change, transaction 2 will have read a row that is considered to have never existed.<br/>**Non-repeatable Read** Transaction 1 reads a row. Transaction 2 updates or deletes that row and commits this change. If transaction 1 tries to reread the row, it will receive different row values or discover that the row has been deleted.<br/>**Phantom** Transaction 1 reads a set of rows that satisfy some search criteria. Transaction 2 generates one or more rows (through either inserts or updates) that match the search criteria. If transaction 1 re-executes the statement that reads the rows, it receives a different set of rows.<br/><br/>If the data source supports transactions, the driver returns one of the following bitmasks:<br/>SQL_TXN_READ_UNCOMMITTED = Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantoms are possible.<br/>SQL_TXN_READ_COMMITTED = Dirty reads are not possible.

|SQL_DESCRIBE_PARAMETER|3.0|A character string: "Y" if parameters can be described; "N", if not.<br/><br/>An SQL-92 Full level-conformant driver will usually return "Y" because it will support the **DESCRIBE INPUT** statement. Because this does not directly specify the underlying SQL support, however, describing parameters might not be supported, even in a SQL-92 Full level-conformant driver.|
|SQL_DM_VER|3.0|A character string with the version of the Driver Manager. The version is of the form ##.##.####.####, where:<br/>The first set of two digits is the major ODBC version, as given by the constant SQL_SPEC_MAJOR.<br/>The second set of two digits is the minor ODBC version, as given by the constant SQL_SPEC_MINOR.<br/>The third set of four digits is the Driver Manager major build number.<br/>The last set of four digits is the Driver Manager minor build number.<br/>The Windows 7 Driver Manager version is 03.80. The Windows 8 Driver Manager version is 03.81.|
|SQL_DRIVER_AWARE_POOLING_SUPPORTED|3.8|A SQLUINTEGER value that indicates if the driver support driver-aware pooling. (For more information, see [Driver-Aware Connection Pooling](../develop-app/driver-aware-connection-pooling.md).<br/><br/>SQL_DRIVER_AWARE_POOLING_CAPABLE indicates that the driver can support driver-aware pooling mechanism.<br/>SQL_DRIVER_AWARE_POOLING_NOT_CAPABLE indicates that the driver cannot support driver-aware pooling mechanism.<br/><br/>A driver does not need to implement SQL_DRIVER_AWARE_POOLING_SUPPORTED and the Driver Manager will not honor to the driver's return value.|
|SQL_DRIVER_HDBCSQL_DRIVER_HENV|1.0|An SQLULEN value, the driver's environment handle or connection handle, determined by the argument *InfoType*.<br/><br/>These information types are implemented by the Driver Manager alone.|
|SQL_DRIVER_HDESC|3.0|An SQLULEN value, the driver's descriptor handle determined by the Driver Manager's descriptor handle, which must be passed on input in \**InfoValuePtr* from the application. In this case, *InfoValuePtr* is both an input and output argument. The input descriptor handle passed in \**InfoValuePtr* must have been either explicitly or implicitly allocated on the *ConnectionHandle*.<br/><br/>The application should make a copy of the Driver Manager's descriptor handle before it calls **SQLGetInfo** with this information type, to make sure that the handle is not overwritten on output.<br/><br/>This information type is implemented by the Driver Manager alone.|
|SQL_DRIVER_HLIB|2.0|An SQLULEN value, the *hinst* from the load library returned to the Driver Manager when it loaded the driver DLL on a Microsoft Windows operating system, or its equivalent on another operating system. The handle is valid only for the connection handle specified in the call to **SQLGetInfo**.<br/><br/>This information type is implemented by the Driver Manager alone.|
|SQL_DRIVER_HSTMT|1.0|An SQLULEN value, the driver's statement handle determined by the Driver Manager statement handle, which must be passed on input in \**InfoValuePtr* from the application. In this case, *InfoValuePtr* is both an input and an output argument. The input statement handle passed in \**InfoValuePtr* must have been allocated on the argument *ConnectionHandle*.<br/><br/>The application should make a copy of the Driver Manager's statement handle before it calls **SQLGetInfo** with this information type, to ensure that the handle is not overwritten on output.<br/><br/>This information type is implemented by the Driver Manager alone.|
|SQL_DRIVER_NAME|1.0|A character string with the file name of the driver used to access the data source.|
|SQL_DRIVER_ODBC_VER|2.0|A character string with the version of ODBC that the driver supports. The version is of the form ##.##, where the first two digits are the major version and the next two digits are the minor version. SQL_SPEC_MAJOR and SQL_SPEC_MINOR define the major and minor version numbers. For the version of ODBC described in this manual, these are 3 and 0, and the driver should return "03.00".<br/><br/>The ODBC Driver Manager will not modify the return value of SQLGetInfo(SQL_DRIVER_ODBC_VER) to maintain backward compatibility for existing applications. The driver specifies which value will be returned. However, a driver that supports C data type extensibility must return 3.8 (or higher) when an application calls **SQLSetEnvAttr** to set SQL_ATTR_ODBC_VERSION to 3.8. For more information, see [C Data Types in ODBC](../develop-app/c-data-types-in-odbc.md).|

|SQL_DYNAMIC_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES1|3.0|An SQLUINTEGER bitmask that describes the attributes of a dynamic cursor that are supported by the driver. This bitmask contains the first subset of attributes; for the second subset, see SQL_DYNAMIC_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES2.<br/><br/>The following bitmasks are used to determine which attributes are supported:<br/>SQL_CA1_NEXT = A *FetchOrientation* argument of SQL_FETCH_NEXT is supported in a call to **SQLFetchScroll** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_ABSOLUTE = *FetchOrientation* arguments of SQL_FETCH_FIRST, SQL_FETCH_LAST, and SQL_FETCH_ABSOLUTE are supported in a call to **SQLFetchScroll** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor. (The rowset that will be fetched is independent of the current cursor position.)<br/>SQL_CA1_RELATIVE = *FetchOrientation* arguments of SQL_FETCH_PRIOR and SQL_FETCH_RELATIVE are supported in a call to **SQLFetchScroll** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor. (The rowset that will be fetched depends on the current cursor position. Note that this is separated from SQL_FETCH_NEXT because in a forward-only cursor, only SQL_FETCH_NEXT is supported.)<br/>SQL_CA1_BOOKMARK = A *FetchOrientation* argument of SQL_FETCH_BOOKMARK is supported in a call to **SQLFetchScroll** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE = A *LockType* argument of SQL_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE is supported in a call to **SQLSetPos** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_LOCK_NO_CHANGE = A *LockType* argument of SQL_LOCK_NO_CHANGE is supported in a call to **SQLSetPos** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_LOCK_UNLOCK = A *LockType* argument of SQL_LOCK_UNLOCK is supported in a call to **SQLSetPos** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_POS_POSITION = An *Operation* argument of SQL_POSITION is supported in a call to **SQLSetPos** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_POS_UPDATE = An *Operation* argument of SQL_UPDATE is supported in a call to **SQLSetPos** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_POS_DELETE = An *Operation* argument of SQL_DELETE is supported in a call to **SQLSetPos** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_POS_REFRESH = An *Operation* argument of SQL_REFRESH is supported in a call to **SQLSetPos** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_POSITIONED_UPDATE = An UPDATE WHERE CURRENT OF SQL statement is supported when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.

(An SQL-92 Entry level-conformant driver will always return this option as supported.)<br/>SQL_CA1_SELECT_FOR_UPDATE = A SELECT FOR UPDATE SQL statement is supported when the cursor is a dynamic cursor. (An SQL-92 Entry level-conformant driver will always return this option as supported.)<br/>SQL_CA1_BULK_ADD = An *Operation* argument of SQL_ADD is supported in a call to **SQLBulkOperations** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_BULK_UPDATE_BY_BOOKMARK = An *Operation* argument of SQL_UPDATE_BY_BOOKMARK is supported in a call to **SQLBulkOperations** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_BULK_DELETE_BY_BOOKMARK = An *Operation* argument of SQL_DELETE_BY_BOOKMARK is supported in a call to **SQLBulkOperations** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA1_BULK_FETCH_BY_BOOKMARK = An *Operation* argument of SQL_FETCH_BY_BOOKMARK is supported in a call to **SQLBulkOperations** when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/><br/>An SQL-92 Intermediate level-conformant driver will usually return the SQL_CA1_NEXT, SQL_CA1_ABSOLUTE, and SQL_CA1_RELATIVE options as supported, because it supports scrollable cursors through the embedded SQL FETCH statement. Because this does not directly determine the underlying SQL support, however, scrollable cursors may not be supported, even for an SQL-92 Intermediate level-conformant driver.|
|SQL_DYNAMIC_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES2|3.0|An SQLUINTEGER bitmask that describes the attributes of a dynamic cursor that are supported by the driver. This bitmask contains the second subset of attributes; for the first subset, see SQL_DYNAMIC_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES1.<br/><br/>The following bitmasks are used to determine which attributes are supported:<br/>SQL_CA2_READ_ONLY_CONCURRENCY = A read-only dynamic cursor, in which no updates are allowed, is supported. (The SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY statement attribute can be SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY for a dynamic cursor).<br/>SQL_CA2_LOCK_CONCURRENCY = A dynamic cursor that uses the lowest level of locking sufficient to make sure that the row can be updated is supported. (The SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY statement attribute can be SQL_CONCUR_LOCK for a dynamic cursor.) These locks must be consistent with the transaction isolation level set by the SQL_ATTR_TXN_ISOLATION connection attribute.<br/>SQL_CA2_OPT_ROWVER_CONCURRENCY = A dynamic cursor that uses the optimistic concurrency control comparing row versions is supported. (The SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY statement attribute can be SQL_CONCUR_ROWVER for a dynamic cursor.)<br/>SQL_CA2_OPT_VALUES_CONCURRENCY = A dynamic cursor that uses the optimistic concurrency control comparing values is supported. (The SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY statement attribute can be SQL_CONCUR_VALUES for a dynamic cursor.)<br/>SQL_CA2_SENSITIVITY_ADDITIONS = Added rows are visible to a dynamic cursor; the cursor can scroll to those rows. (Where these rows are added to the cursor is driver-dependent.)<br/>SQL_CA2_SENSITIVITY_DELETIONS = Deleted rows are no longer available to a dynamic cursor, and do not leave a "hole" in the result set; after the dynamic cursor scrolls from a deleted row, it cannot return to that row.<br/>SQL_CA2_SENSITIVITY_UPDATES = Updates to rows are visible to a dynamic cursor; if the dynamic cursor scrolls from and returns to an updated row, the data returned by the cursor is the updated data, not the original data.<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_SELECT = The SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS statement attribute affects **SELECT** statements when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_INSERT = The SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS statement attribute affects **INSERT** statements when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_DELETE = The SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS statement attribute affects **DELETE** statements when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_UPDATE = The SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS statement attribute affects **UPDATE** statements when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_CATALOG = The SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS statement attribute affects **CATALOG** result sets when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_AFFECTS_ALL = The SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS statement attribute affects **SELECT**, **INSERT**, **DELETE**, and **UPDATE** statements, and **CATALOG** result sets, when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA2_CRC_EXACT = The exact row count is available in the SQL_DIAG_CURSOR_ROW_COUNT diagnostic field when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA2_CRC_APPROXIMATE = An approximate row count is available in the SQL_DIAG_CURSOR_ROW_COUNT diagnostic field when the cursor is a dynamic cursor.<br/>SQL_CA2_SIMULATE_NON_UNIQUE = The driver does not guarantee that simulated positioned update or delete statements will affect only one row when the cursor is a dynamic cursor; it is the application's responsibility to guarantee this. (If a statement affects more than one row, **SQLExecute** or **SQLExecDirect** returns SQLSTATE 01001 [Cursor operation conflict].) To set this behavior, the application calls **SQLSetStmtAttr** with the SQL_ATTR_SIMULATE_CURSOR attribute set to SQL_SC_NON_UNIQUE.<br/>SQL_CA2_SIMULATE_TRY_UNIQUE = The driver tries to guarantee that simulated positioned update or delete statements will affect only one row when the cursor is a dynamic cursor. The driver always executes such statements, even if they might affect more than one row, such as when there is no unique key. (If a statement affects more than one row, **SQLExecute** or **SQLExecDirect** returns SQLSTATE 01001 [Cursor operation conflict].) To set this behavior, the application calls **SQLSetStmtAttr** with the SQL_ATTR_SIMULATE_CURSOR attribute set to SQL_SC_TRY_UNIQUE.<br/>SQL_CA2_SIMULATE_UNIQUE = The driver guarantees that simulated positioned update or delete statements will affect only one row when the cursor is a dynamic cursor. If the driver cannot guarantee this for a given statement, **SQLExecDirect** or **SQLPrepare** return SQLSTATE 01001 (Cursor operation conflict). To set this behavior, the application calls **SQLSetStmtAttr** with the SQL_ATTR_SIMULATE_CURSOR attribute set to SQL_SC_UNIQUE.|
|SQL_EXPRESSIONS_IN_ORDERBY|1.0|A character string: "Y" if the data source supports expressions in the **ORDER BY** list; "N" if it does not.|
|SQL_FILE_USAGE|2.0|An SQLUSMALLINT value that indicates how a single-tier driver directly treats files in a data source:<br/>SQL_FILE_NOT_SUPPORTED = The driver is not a single-tier driver. For example, an ORACLE driver is a two-tier driver.<br/>SQL_FILE_TABLE = A single-tier driver treats files in a data source as tables. For example, an Xbase driver treats each Xbase file as a table.<br/>SQL_FILE_CATALOG = A single-tier driver treats files in a data source as a catalog. For example, a Microsoft Access driver treats each Microsoft Access file as a complete database.<br/><br/>An application might use this to determine how users will select data. For example, Xbase users often think of data as stored in files, whereas ORACLE and Microsoft Access users generally think of data as stored in tables.<br/><br/>When a user selects an Xbase data source, the application could display the Windows **File Open** common dialog box; when the user selects a Microsoft Access or ORACLE data source, the application could display a custom **Select Table** dialog box.|
|SQL_FORWARD_ONLY_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES1|3.0|An SQLUINTEGER bitmask that describes the attributes of a forward-only cursor that are supported by the driver.

|SQL_FORWARD_ONLY_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES2|3.0|An SQLUINTEGER bitmask that describes the attributes of a forward-only cursor that are supported by the driver. This bitmask contains the second subset of attributes; for the first subset, see SQL_FORWARD_ONLY_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES1.<br/><br/>The following bitmasks are used to determine which attributes are supported:<br/>SQL_CA2_READ_ONLY_CONCURRENCY<br/>SQL_CA2_LOCK_CONCURRENCY<br/>SQL_CA2_OPT_ROWVER_CONCURRENCY<br/>SQL_CA2_OPT_VALUES_CONCURRENCY<br/>SQL_CA2_SENSITIVITY_ADDITIONS<br/>SQL_CA2_SENSITIVITY_DELETIONS<br/>SQL_CA2_SENSITIVITY_UPDATES<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_SELECT<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_INSERT<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_DELETE<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_UPDATE<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_CATALOG<br/>SQL_CA2_MAX_ROWS_AFFECTS_ALL<br/>SQL_CA2_CRC_EXACT<br/>SQL_CA2_CRC_APPROXIMATE<br/>SQL_CA2_SIMULATE_NON_UNIQUE<br/>SQL_CA2_SIMULATE_TRY_UNIQUE<br/>SQL_CA2_SIMULATE_UNIQUE<br/><br/>For descriptions of these bitmasks, see SQL_DYNAMIC_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES2 (and substitute "forward-only cursor" for "dynamic cursor" in the descriptions).|
|SQL_GETDATA_EXTENSIONS|2.0|An SQLUINTEGER bitmask enumerating extensions to **SQLGetData**.<br/><br/>The following bitmasks are used together with the flag to determine what common extensions the driver supports for **SQLGetData**:<br/>SQL_GD_ANY_COLUMN = **SQLGetData** can be called for any unbound column, including those before the last bound column. Note that the columns must be called in order of ascending column number unless SQL_GD_ANY_ORDER is also returned.<br/>SQL_GD_ANY_ORDER = **SQLGetData** can be called for unbound columns in any order. Note that **SQLGetData** can be called only for columns after the last bound column unless SQL_GD_ANY_COLUMN is also returned.<br/>SQL_GD_BLOCK = **SQLGetData** can be called for an unbound column in any row in a block (where the rowset size is greater than 1) of data after positioning to that row with **SQLSetPos**.<br/>SQL_GD_BOUND = **SQLGetData** can be called for bound columns in addition to unbound columns. A driver cannot return this value unless it also returns SQL_GD_ANY_COLUMN.<br/>SQL_GD_OUTPUT_PARAMS = **SQLGetData** can be called to return output parameter values. For more information, see [Retrieving Output Parameters Using SQLGetData](../develop-app/retrieving-output-parameters-using-sqlgetdata.md).<br/><br/>**SQLGetData** is required to return data only from unbound columns that occur after the last bound column, are called in order of increasing column number, and are not in a row in a block of rows.<br/><br/>If a driver supports bookmarks (either fixed-length or variable-length), it must support calling **SQLGetData** on column 0. This support is required regardless of what the driver returns for a call to **SQLGetInfo** with the SQL_GETDATA_EXTENSIONS *InfoType*.|
|SQL_GROUP_BY|2.0|An SQLUSMALLINT value that specifies the relationship between the columns in the **GROUP BY** clause and the nonaggregated columns in the select list:<br/>SQL_GB_COLLATE = A **COLLATE** clause can be specified at the end of each grouping column. (ODBC 3.0)<br/>SQL_GB_NOT_SUPPORTED = **GROUP BY** clauses are not supported. (ODBC 2.0)<br/>SQL_GB_GROUP_BY_EQUALS_SELECT = The **GROUP BY** clause must contain all nonaggregated columns in the select list. It cannot contain any other columns. For example, **SELECT DEPT, MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY DEPT**. (ODBC 2.0)<br/>SQL_GB_GROUP_BY_CONTAINS_SELECT = The **GROUP BY** clause must contain all nonaggregated columns in the select list. It can contain columns that are not in the select list. For example, **SELECT DEPT, MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY DEPT, AGE**. (ODBC 2.0)<br/>SQL_GB_NO_RELATION = The columns in the **GROUP BY** clause and the select list are not related. The meaning of nongrouped, nonaggregated columns in the select list is data source-dependent. For example, **SELECT DEPT, SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY DEPT, AGE**. (ODBC 2.0)<br/><br/>An SQL-92 Entry level-conformant driver will always return the SQL_GB_GROUP_BY_EQUALS_SELECT option as supported. An SQL-92 Full level-conformant driver will always return the SQL_GB_COLLATE option as supported. If none of the options are supported, the **GROUP BY** clause is not supported by the data source.|
|SQL_IDENTIFIER_CASE|1.0|An SQLUSMALLINT value as follows:<br/>SQL_IC_UPPER = Identifiers in SQL are not case-sensitive and are stored in uppercase in system catalog.<br/>SQL_IC_LOWER = Identifiers in SQL are not case-sensitive and are stored in lowercase in system catalog.<br/>SQL_IC_SENSITIVE = Identifiers in SQL are case sensitive and are stored in mixed case in system catalog.<br/>SQL_IC_MIXED = Identifiers in SQL are not case-sensitive and are stored in mixed case in system catalog.<br/><br/>Because identifiers in SQL-92 are never case-sensitive, a driver that conforms strictly to SQL-92 (any level) will never return the SQL_IC_SENSITIVE option as supported.|
|SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR|1.0|The character string that is used as the starting and ending delimiter of a quoted (delimited) identifier in SQL statements. (Identifiers passed as arguments to ODBC functions do not have to be quoted.) If the data source does not support quoted identifiers, a blank is returned.<br/><br/>This character string can also be used for quoting catalog function arguments when the connection attribute SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID is set to SQL_TRUE.<br/><br/>Because the identifier quote character in SQL-92 is the double quotation mark ("), a driver that conforms strictly to SQL-92 will always return the double quotation mark character.|
|SQL_INDEX_KEYWORDS|3.0|An SQLUINTEGER bitmask that enumerates keywords in the CREATE INDEX statement that are supported by the driver:<br/>SQL_IK_NONE = None of the keywords is supported.<br/>SQL_IK_ASC = ASC keyword is supported.<br/>SQL_IK_DESC = DESC keyword is supported.<br/>SQL_IK_ALL = All keywords are supported.<br/><br/>To see whether the CREATE INDEX statement is supported, an application calls **SQLGetInfo** with the SQL_DLL_INDEX information type.|
|SQL_INFO_SCHEMA_VIEWS|3.0|An SQLUINTEGER bitmask enumerating the views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA that are supported by the driver. The views in, and the contents of, INFORMATION_SCHEMA are as defined in SQL-92.<br/><br/>The SQL-92 or FIPS conformance level at which this feature must be supported is shown in parentheses next to each bitmask.<br/><br/>The following bitmasks are used to determine which views are supported:<br/>SQL_ISV_ASSERTIONS = Identifies the catalog's assertions that are owned by a given user.

|SQL_INTEGRITY|1.0|A character string: "Y" if the data source supports the Integrity Enhancement Facility; "N" if it does not.<br/><br/>This *InfoType* has been renamed for ODBC 3.0 from the ODBC 2.0 *InfoType* SQL_ODBC_SQL_OPT_IEF.|
|SQL_KEYSET_CURSOR_ATTRIBUTES1|3.0|An SQLUINTEGER bitmask that describes the attributes of a keyset cursor that are supported by the driver.

## Example  

 **SQLGetInfo** returns lists of supported options as an SQLUINTEGER bitmask in **InfoValuePtr*. The bitmask for each option is used together with the flag to determine whether the option is supported.  
  
 For example, an application could use the following code to determine whether the SUBSTRING scalar function is supported by the driver associated with the connection.  
  
 For another example of using **SQLGetInfo**, see [SQLTables Function](sqltables-function.md).  
  
```cpp  
SQLUINTEGER fFuncs;  
  
SQLGetInfo(hdbc,  
           SQL_STRING_FUNCTIONS,  
           (SQLPOINTER)&fFuncs,  
           sizeof(fFuncs),  
           NULL);  
  
// SUBSTRING supported  
if (fFuncs & SQL_FN_STR_SUBSTRING)  
   ;   // do something  
  
// SUBSTRING not supported  
else  
   ;   // do something else  
```
