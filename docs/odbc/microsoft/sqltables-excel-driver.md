|Argument|Comments|  
|--------------|--------------|  
|*szTableOwner*|The only valid argument for *szTableOwner* is NULL because none of the drivers support owner names. With *szTableOwner* set to NULL, all tables are returned. NULL is returned in the TABLE_OWNER column.|  
|*szTableQualifier*|When the Microsoft Excel 3.0 or 4.0 driver is used, if you call **SQLTables** with a value for *szTableQualifier* that is not the name of an existing table, the driver will create a table with that name.<br /><br /> In the TABLE_QUALIFIER column, **SQLTables** will return the path to a directory.|  
|*SzTableType*|For Microsoft Excel 3.0 or 4.0, "TABLE" is the only table type supported.<br /><br /> For later versions of Microsoft Excel files, "SYSTEM TABLE" is returned for sheet names (tables with a "$" on the end), and "TABLE" is returned for tables within worksheets.|
