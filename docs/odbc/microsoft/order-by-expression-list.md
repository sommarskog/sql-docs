# ORDER BY expression-list
Expressions can be used in the ORDER BY clause. For example, in the following clauses the table is ordered by three key expressions: a+b, c+d, and e.  
  
```  
SELECT * FROM emp  
ORDER BY a+b,c+d,e  
```  
  
 No ordering is allowed on set functions or an expression that contains a set function.
