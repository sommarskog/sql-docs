# SQLSetCursorName (Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver)
> [!NOTE]  
>  This topic contains Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver-specific information. For general information about this function, see the appropriate topic under [ODBC API Reference](../../odbc/reference/syntax/odbc-api-reference.md).  
  
 Support: Full  
  
 ODBC API Conformance: Core Level  
  
 Associates a cursor name with an active statement handle, *hstmt*. **SQLSetCursorName** is included in the Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver API because it is a part of Core Level ODBC API functionality; it cannot be used with other API functions because the driver does not support positioned updates.  
  
 For more information, see [SQLSetCursorName](../../odbc/reference/syntax/sqlsetcursorname-function.md) in the *ODBC Programmer's Reference*.
