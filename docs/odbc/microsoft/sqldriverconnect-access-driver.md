# SQLDriverConnect (Access Driver)
> [!NOTE]  
>  This topic provides Access Driver-specific information. For general information about this function, see the appropriate topic under [ODBC API Reference](../../odbc/reference/syntax/odbc-api-reference.md).  
  
 **SQLDriverConnect** enables you to connect to a driver without creating a data source (DSN).  
  
 The following keywords are supported in the connection string for all drivers: **DSN**, **DBQ**, and **FIL**.  
  
 The **UID** and **PWD** keywords are also supported.  
  
 The PWD keyword should not include any of the special characters (see SQL_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS in **SQLGetInfo** Returned Values).  
  
 The following table shows the minimum keywords required to connect to each driver, and provides an example of keyword/value pairs used with **SQLDriverConnect**. For a full list of DRIVERID values, see [SQLConfigDataSource](../../odbc/microsoft/sqlconfigdatasource-access-driver.md).  
  
|Driver|Keywords Required|Examples|  
|------------|-----------------------|--------------|  
|Microsoft Access|Driver, DBQ|Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)}; DBQ=c:\\\temp\\\sample.mdb|
