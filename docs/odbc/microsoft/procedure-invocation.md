# Procedure Invocation
When the Microsoft Access driver is used, procedures can be invoked from the driver by using the **SQLExecDirect** or **SQLPrepare** function with the following syntax: {CALL *procedure-name* [(*parameter*[,*parameter*]...)]}. Note that expressions are not supported as parameters to a called procedure.  
  
 If a procedure name includes a dash, the name must be delimited with back quotes (`).  
  
 A parameterized query can be called using the previous statement.
