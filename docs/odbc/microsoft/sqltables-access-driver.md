# SQLTables (Access Driver)
> [!NOTE]  
>  This topic provides Access Driver-specific information. For general information about this function, see the appropriate topic under [ODBC API Reference](../../odbc/reference/syntax/odbc-api-reference.md).  
  
|Argument|Comments|  
|--------------|--------------|  
|*szTableOwner*|The only valid argument for *szTableOwner* is NULL because none of the drivers support owner names. With *szTableOwner* set to NULL, all tables are returned. NULL is returned in the TABLE_OWNER column.|  
|*szTableQualifier*|In the TABLE_QUALIFIER column, **SQLTables** will return the path to a database file.|  
|*SzTableType*|When the Microsoft Access driver is used, "SYSTEM TABLE" is supported for *szTableType* for system tables, "SYNONYM" is supported for attached tables, and "VIEW" is supported for row-returning queries.|
