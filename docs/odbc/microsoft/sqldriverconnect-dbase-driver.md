# SQLDriverConnect (dBASE Driver)
> [!NOTE]  
>  This topic provides dBASE Driver-specific information. For general information about this function, see the appropriate topic under [ODBC API Reference](../../odbc/reference/syntax/odbc-api-reference.md).  
  
 **SQLDriverConnect** enables you to connect to a driver without creating a data source (DSN).  
  
 The following keywords are supported in the connection string for all drivers: **DSN**, **DBQ**, and **FIL**.  
  
 When the Paradox driver is used, after a password-protected file has been opened by a user, other users are not allowed to open the same file.  
  
 The following table shows the minimum keywords required to connect to each driver, and provides an example of keyword/value pairs used with **SQLDriverConnect**. For a full list of DRIVERID values, see [SQLConfigDataSource](../../odbc/microsoft/sqlconfigdatasource-dbase-driver.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If DBQ or DefaultDir is not specified for the dBASEdriver, the driver will connect to the current directory.
