|SQL_COLUMN_DISPLAY_SIZE|For LONGVARBINARY data, SQL_COLUMN_DISPLAY_SIZE is the maximum length of the column, not the maximum length of the column times 2.|  
|SQL_OWNER_NAME|An empty string ("") is returned in this column because owner name is not supported.|  
|SQL_QUALIFIER_NAME|The path to a directory is returned.|  
|SQL_COLUMN_SEARCHABLE|LONGVARBINARY and LONGVARCHAR columns are reported as SQL_UNSEARCHABLE.<br /><br /> Fixed-length and variable-length binary and character data types are searchable, even though LONGVARBINARY and LONGVARCHAR are not.|
