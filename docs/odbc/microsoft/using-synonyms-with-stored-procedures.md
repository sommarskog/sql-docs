# Using Synonyms with Stored Procedures
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This feature will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Instead, use the ODBC driver provided by Oracle.  
  
 The Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle versions 2.0 and 2.5 do not support synonyms when calling Oracle stored procedures. Synonyms work as expected when used with other Oracle database objects such as tables.
