# SQLSetCursorName (Desktop Database Drivers)
Because the driver does not support a positioned update or delete by the WHERE CURRENT OF *cursorname* syntax, **SQLSetCursorName** is supported, but cannot be used for positioned updates. It can only be used when the Cursor Library is enabled and the application is using **SQLExtendedFetch**.
