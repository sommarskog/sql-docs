# SQLTransact (Access Driver)
> [!NOTE]  
>  This topic provides Access Driver-specific information. For general information about this function, see the appropriate topic under [ODBC API Reference](../../odbc/reference/syntax/odbc-api-reference.md).  
  
 When the Microsoft Access driver is used, SQL_COMMIT and SQL_ROLLBACK are supported for the *fType* argument in a call to **SQLTransact**.  
  
 If a failure occurs during the commit process, the affected database can be repaired using the Repair Database option in the Microsoft Access driver setup, or through the use of the REPAIR_DB keyword in the **SQLConfigDataSource** function.
