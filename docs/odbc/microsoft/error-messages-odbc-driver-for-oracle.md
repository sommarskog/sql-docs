# Error Messages (ODBC Driver for Oracle)
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This feature will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Instead, use the ODBC driver provided by Oracle.  
  
 When an error occurs, the Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle returns the SQLSTATE (an ODBC error code) and an error message. The driver derives this information both from errors detected by the driver and from errors returned by the Oracle Server.  
  
 This section includes the following topic:
