<sup>1</sup> Supported on Windows Server 2012 with [KB2999226](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2074061).  
<sup>2</sup> Supported on Windows Server 2012 R2 with [April 2014 update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2073785) and [KB2999226](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2074061).  
<sup>3</sup> Supported on Windows 8.1 with [April 2014 update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2073785) and [KB2999226](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2074061).  

## ADO support policies  

ADO applications can use the SQLOLEDB OLE DB provider that is included with Windows if they don't require any of the features of [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] or later.  

ADO applications can use the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server, but if they do so they must specify `DataTypeCompatibility=80` in the connection strings. Only features from [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] are available when `DataTypeCompatibility=80` is present in the connection strings.  

## OLE DB support policies  

Applications can use the OLE DB provider (SQLOLEDB) included with the Windows operating system. However, that is in maintenance mode and no longer updated. Use the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server (MSOLEDBSQL19 or MSOLEDBSQL) instead.
