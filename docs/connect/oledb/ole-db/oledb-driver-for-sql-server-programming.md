# OLE DB Driver for SQL Server Programming
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server is a low-level COM API that is used for accessing data. The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server is recommended for developing tools, utilities, or low-level components that need high performance. The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server is a native, high performance provider that accesses the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol directly.  
  
 OLE DB Driver for SQL Server provides OLE DB support to applications connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server is an OLE DB version 2.0-compliant provider.
