# Fetching Rows - Next Fetch Position (OLE DB Driver)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server keeps track of the next fetch position so that a sequence of calls to the **GetNextRows** method (without skips, changes of direction, or intervening calls to the **FindNextRow**, **Seek**, or **RestartPosition** methods) reads the whole rowset without skipping or repeating any row. The next fetch position is changed either by calling **IRowset::GetNextRows**, **IRowset::RestartPosition**, or **IRowsetIndex::Seek**, or by calling **FindNextRow** with a null *pBookmark* value. Calling **FindNextRow** with a nonnull *pBookmark* value does not affect the next fetch position.
