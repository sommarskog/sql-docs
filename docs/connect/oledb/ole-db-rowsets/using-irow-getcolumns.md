# Using IRow::GetColumns
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  The **IRow** implementation allows forward-only sequential access to the columns. You can either access all the columns in the row with a single call to **IRow::GetColumns** or call **IRow::GetColumns** multiple times every time that you access several columns in the row.  
  
 The multiple calls to **IRow::GetColumns** should not overlap. For example, if the first call to **IRow::GetColumns** retrieves columns 1, 2, and 3, the second call to **IRow::GetColumns** should call for columns 4, 5, and 6. If later calls to **IRow::GetColumns** overlap, the status flag (dwstatus field in DBCOLUMNACCESS) is set to DBSTATUS_E_UNAVAILABLE.
