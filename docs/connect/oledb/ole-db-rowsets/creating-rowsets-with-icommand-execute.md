# Creating Rowsets with ICommand::Execute
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  For rowsets created by using the **ICommand::Execute** method, the properties that you want in the resulting rowset can constrain the text of the command. This is especially critical for consumers that support dynamic command text.  
  
 The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server cannot use [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cursors to support the multiple-rowset results generated by many commands. If a consumer requests a rowset requiring [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cursor support, an error occurs if the command text generates more than a single rowset as its result. For more information, see [Commands Generating Multiple-Rowset Results](../../oledb/ole-db-commands/commands-generating-multiple-rowset-results.md).  
  
 Scrollable OLE DB Driver for SQL Server rowsets are supported by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cursors. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] imposes limitations on cursors that are sensitive to changes made by other users of the database. Specifically, the rows in some cursors cannot be ordered, and trying to create a rowset by using a command that contains an SQL ORDER BY clause can fail. For more information, see [Rowsets and SQL Server Cursors](../../oledb/ole-db-rowsets/rowsets-and-sql-server-cursors.md).
