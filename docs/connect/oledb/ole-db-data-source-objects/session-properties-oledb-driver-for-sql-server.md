# Session Properties - OLE DB Driver for SQL Server
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server interprets OLE DB session properties as follows.  
  
|Property ID|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|DBPROP_SESS_AUTOCOMMITISOLEVELS|The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server supports all autocommit transaction isolation levels with the exception of the chaos level DBPROPVAL_TI_CHAOS.|  
  
 In the provider-specific property set DBPROPSET_SQLSERVERSESSION, the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server defines the following additional session property.  
  
|Property ID|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|SSPROP_QUOTEDCATALOGNAMES|Type: VT_BOOL<br /><br /> R/W: Read/write<br /><br /> Default: VARIANT_FALSE<br /><br /> Description: Quoted identifiers allowed in CATALOG restriction.<br /><br /> VARIANT_TRUE: Quoted identifiers are recognized for a catalog restriction for the schema rowsets that supply distributed query support.<br /><br /> VARIANT_FALSE: Quoted identifiers are not recognized for a catalog restriction for the schema rowsets that supply distributed query support.<br /><br /> For more information about schema rowsets that supply distributed query support, see [Distributed Query Support in Schema Rowsets](../../oledb/ole-db/schema-rowsets-distributed-query-support.md).|  
|SSPROP_ALLOWNATIVEVARIANT|Type: VT_BOOL<br /><br /> R/W: Read/Write<br /><br /> Default: VARIANT_FALSE<br /><br /> Description: Determines if the data fetched in is as DBTYPE_VARIANT or DBTYPE_SQLVARIANT.<br /><br /> VARIANT_TRUE: Column type is returned as DBTYPE_SQLVARIANT in which case the buffer will hold SSVARIANT structure.<br /><br /> VARIANT_FALSE: Column type is returned as DBTYPE_VARIANT and the buffer will have VARIANT structure.|  
|SSPROP_ASYNCH_BULKCOPY|To use asynchronous mode, set the provider specific session property SSPROP_ASYNCH_BULKCOPY to VARIANT_TRUE before calling the BCPExec method. This property is available in the DBPROPSET_SQLSERVERSESSION property set.|
