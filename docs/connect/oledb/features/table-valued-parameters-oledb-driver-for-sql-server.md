# Table-Valued Parameters (OLE DB Driver for SQL Server)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  Table-valued parameters were introduced in [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../../includes/sql2008-md.md)], and provide an efficient way to pass multiple rows of data to the server. Table-valued parameters provide functionality similar to parameter arrays, but they offer more flexibility and closer integration with [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)], and can frequently improve performance. Table-valued parameters can also participate in set-based operations, whereas parameter arrays cannot.
