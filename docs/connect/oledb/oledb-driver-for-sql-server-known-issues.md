This article contains a list of known issues and fixes for the Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.

## Known issues

- The driver returns the following error message: `Error loading adal.dll from system directory. Verify that Active Directory Authentication Library for SQL Server is properly installed`. The most likely cause of this error is incorrect bitness of `adal.dll`. It can be caused by the installation of version 19.2.0 of the OLE DB Driver. Version 19.2.0 erroneously places a 64-bit ADAL library into the 32-bit system directory. To resolve this issue, install the OLE DB Driver version 19.3 or higher. It includes ADAL 3.6.1 with the correct bitness.
- Currently, MSOLEDBSQL19 prevents the creation of linked servers without encryption and a trusted certificate (a self-signed certificate is insufficient). For more information, see [Linked servers](../../relational-databases/linked-servers/linked-servers-database-engine.md?view=sql-server-ver16&preserve-view=true#msoledbsql19-and-linked-servers).
