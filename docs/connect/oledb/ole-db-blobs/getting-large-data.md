# Getting Large Data
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  In general, consumers should isolate code that creates an OLE DB Driver for SQL Server storage object from other code that handles data that is not referenced through an **ISequentialStream** interface pointer.  
  
 This article refers to functionality available with the following functions:  
  
-   IRowset:GetData  
  
-   IRow::GetColumns  
  
-   ICommand::Execute  
  
 The consumer should fetch only a single row of data in a call to the **GetNextRows** method when the DBPROP_ACCESSORDER property, in the rowset property group, is set to either DBPROPVAL_AO_SEQUENTIAL or DBPROPVAL_AO_SEQUENTIALSTORAGEOBJECTS. This is because BLOB data is not buffered. If the value of DBPROP_ACCESSORDER is set to DBPROPVAL_AO_RANDOM, the consumer can fetch multiple rows of data in **GetNextRows**.  
  
 The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server does not retrieve large data from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] until requested to do so by the consumer. The consumer should bind all short data in one accessor, and then use one or more temporary accessors to retrieve large data values as required.  
  
## Example  
 This example retrieves a large data value from a single column:  
  
```  
HRESULT GetUnboundData  
    (  
    IRowset* pIRowset,  
    HROW hRow,  
    ULONG nCol,   
    BYTE* pUnboundData  
    )  
    {  
    UINT                cbRow = sizeof(IUnknown*) + sizeof(ULONG);  
    BYTE*               pRow = new BYTE[cbRow];  
  
    DBOBJECT            dbobject;  
  
    IAccessor*          pIAccessor = NULL;  
    HACCESSOR           haccessor;  
  
    DBBINDING           dbbinding;  
    ULONG               ulbindstatus;  
  
    ULONG               dwStatus;  
    ISequentialStream*  pISequentialStream;  
    ULONG               cbRead;  
  
    HRESULT             hr;  
  
    // Set up the DBOBJECT structure.  
    dbobject.dwFlags = STGM_READ;  
    dbobject.iid = IID_ISequentialStream;  
  
    // Create the DBBINDING, requesting a storage-object pointer from  
    // The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.  
    dbbinding.iOrdinal = nCol;  
    dbbinding.obValue = 0;  
    dbbinding.obStatus = sizeof(IUnknown*);  
    dbbinding.obLength = 0;  
    dbbinding.pTypeInfo = NULL;  
    dbbinding.pObject = &dbobject;  
    dbbinding.pBindExt = NULL;  
    dbbinding.dwPart = DBPART_VALUE | DBPART_STATUS;  
    dbbinding.dwMemOwner = DBMEMOWNER_CLIENTOWNED;  
    dbbinding.eParamIO = DBPARAMIO_NOTPARAM;  
    dbbinding.cbMaxLen = 0;  
    dbbinding.dwFlags = 0;  
    dbbinding.wType = DBTYPE_IUNKNOWN;  
    dbbinding.bPrecision = 0;  
    dbbinding.bScale = 0;  
  
    if (FAILED(hr = pIRowset->  
        QueryInterface(IID_IAccessor, (void**) &pIAccessor)))  
        {  
        // Process QueryInterface failure.  
        return (hr);  
        }  
  
    // Create the accessor.  
    if (FAILED(hr = pIAccessor->CreateAccessor(DBACCESSOR_ROWDATA, 1,  
        &dbbinding, 0, &haccessor, &ulbindstatus)))  
        {  
        // Process error from CreateAccessor.  
        pIAccessor->Release();  
        return (hr);  
        }  
  
    // Read and process BLOCK_SIZE bytes at a time.  
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr = pIRowset->GetData(hRow, haccessor, pRow)))  
        {  
        dwStatus = *((ULONG*) (pRow + dbbinding.obStatus));  
  
        if (dwStatus == DBSTATUS_S_ISNULL)  
            {  
            // Process NULL data  
            }  
        else if (dwStatus == DBSTATUS_S_OK)  
            {  
            pISequentialStream = *((ISequentialStream**)   
                (pRow + dbbinding.obValue));  
  
            do  
                {  
                if (SUCCEEDED(hr =  
                    pISequentialStream->Read(pUnboundData,  
                    BLOCK_SIZE, &cbRead)))  
                    {  
                    pUnboundData += cbRead;  
                    }  
                }  
            while (SUCCEEDED(hr) && cbRead >= BLOCK_SIZE);  
  
            pISequentialStream->Release();  
            }  
        }  
    else  
        {  
        // Process error from GetData.  
        }  
  
    pIAccessor->ReleaseAccessor(haccessor, NULL);  
    pIAccessor->Release();  
    delete [] pRow;  
  
    return (hr);  
    }  
```
