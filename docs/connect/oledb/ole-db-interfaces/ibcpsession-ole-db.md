# IBCPSession (OLE DB)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  The **IBCPSession** interface exposes support for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] file-based bulk copy operations. The **IBCPSession** interface is exposed in the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server under the same level as Sessions. In the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server, data source objects are factories for Session objects, and bulk copy operations are specified in the connection property SSPROP_ENABLEBULKCOPY. In addition, the SSPROP_ENABLEFASTLOAD property should be set to true.  
  
 Calling the **IDBCreateSession::CreateSession** method will then result in the creation of a **BulkCopySession** object. All the file-based bulk copy methods exposed through the **IBCPSession** object are then callable with nearly similar signatures on this **IBCPSession** object's **IBCPSession** interface.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server supports memory-based bulk copy operations through the [IRowsetFastLoad](../../oledb/ole-db-interfaces/irowsetfastload-ole-db.md) interface.  
  
 For more information about using the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server for bulk copy operations, see [Performing Bulk Copy Operations](../../oledb/features/performing-bulk-copy-operations.md).  
  
 For a sample showing how to use the **IBCPSession** interface, see [IBCPSession::BCPDone &#40;OLE DB&#41;](../../oledb/ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpdone-ole-db.md).
