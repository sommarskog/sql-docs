# OLE DB Driver for SQL Server (OLE DB) Interfaces
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server exposes interfaces to consumers wanting access to data on one or more computers running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server is an OLE DB version 2.0-compliant provider.  
  
 This OLE DB Driver for SQL Server programming reference does not document all of the OLE DB interfaces and methods, only those interfaces and methods that exhibit provider-specific behavior when using the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.  
  
 For a full description of the core OLE DB interfaces and methods, see the [OLE DB Programmer's Reference](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms713643(v=vs.85)).
