# Data Types (OLE DB)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  In order to execute [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements and process the results using the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server, you must know how the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server maps [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data types to OLE DB data types when binding parameters or columns in a rowset, and when it uses the **ITableDefinition** interface to create a table in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
