# Converting Data Types
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)] allows you to specify data types when you send data to or retrieve data from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Specifying data types is optional. If data types are not specified, default types are used. The topics in this section describe how to specify data types and provide details about default data types.
