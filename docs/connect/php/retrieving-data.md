# Retrieving Data
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

This topic and the topics in this section discuss how to retrieve data.  
  
## SQLSRV Driver  
The SQLSRV driver of the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)] provides the following options for retrieving data from a result set:  
  
-   [sqlsrv_fetch_array](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-fetch-array.md)  
  
-   [sqlsrv_fetch_object](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-fetch-object.md)  
  
-   [sqlsrv_fetch](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-fetch.md)/[sqlsrv_get_field](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-get-field.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> When you use any of the functions mentioned above, avoid null comparisons as the criterion for exiting loops. Because **sqlsrv** functions return false when an error occurs, the following code could result in an infinite loop upon an error in [sqlsrv_fetch_array](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-fetch-array.md):  
>   
> `/*``This code could result in an infinite loop. It is recommended that`  
>   
> `you do NOT use null comparisons as the criterion for exiting loops,`  
>   
> `as is done here. */`  
>   
> `do{`  
>   
> `$result = sqlsrv_fetch_array($stmt);`  
>   
> `} while( !is_null($result));`  
  
If your query retrieves more than one result set, you can move to the next result set with [sqlsrv_next_result](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-next-result.md).  
  
Beginning in version 1.1 of the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)], you can use [sqlsrv_has_rows](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-has-rows.md) to see if a result set has rows.  
  
## PDO_SQLSRV Driver  
The PDO_SQLSRV driver of the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)] provides the following options for retrieving data from a result set:  
  
-   [PDOStatement::fetch](../../connect/php/pdostatement-fetch.md)  
  
-   [PDOStatement::fetchAll](../../connect/php/pdostatement-fetchall.md)  
  
-   [PDOStatement::fetchColumn](../../connect/php/pdostatement-fetchcolumn.md)  
  
-   [PDOStatement::fetchObject](../../connect/php/pdostatement-fetchobject.md)  
  
If your query retrieves more than one result set, you can move to the next result set with [PDOStatement::nextRowset](../../connect/php/pdostatement-nextrowset.md).  
  
You can see how many rows are in a result set if you specify a scrollable cursor, and then call [PDOStatement::rowCount](../../connect/php/pdostatement-rowcount.md).  
  
[PDO::prepare](../../connect/php/pdo-prepare.md) lets you specify a cursor type. Then, with [PDOStatement::fetch](../../connect/php/pdostatement-fetch.md) you can select a row. See [PDO::prepare](../../connect/php/pdo-prepare.md) for a sample and more information.
