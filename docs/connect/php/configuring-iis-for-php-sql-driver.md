# Configuring IIS for the Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

This topic provides links to resources on the [Internet Information Services (IIS) Web site](https://www.iis.net/) that are relevant to configuring IIS to host PHP applications. The resources listed here are specific to using FastCGI with IIS. FastCGI is a standard protocol that allows an application framework's Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executables to interface with the Web server. FastCGI differs from the standard CGI protocol in that FastCGI reuses CGI processes for multiple requests.
