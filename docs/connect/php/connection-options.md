# Connection Options

[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

This topic lists the options that are permitted in the associative array (when using [sqlsrv_connect](sqlsrv-connect.md) in the SQLSRV driver) or the keywords that are permitted in the data source name (dsn) (when using [PDO::__construct](pdo-construct.md) in the PDO_SQLSRV driver).  

## Table of Connection Options

|Key|Value|Description|Default|  
|-------|---------|---------------|-----------|  
|AccessToken|String|The byte string of the Azure AD Access Token extracted from an OAuth JSON response.<br /><br />The connection string must not contain a user ID, password, or the `Authentication` keyword.

|ApplicationIntent|String|Declares the application workload type when connecting to a server. Possible values are **ReadOnly** and **ReadWrite**.<br /><br />For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)] support for [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../includes/sshadr-md.md)], see [Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](php-driver-for-sql-server-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md).|ReadWrite|
|AttachDBFileName|String|Specifies which database file the server should attach.|Not set.|
|Authentication|One of the following strings:<br /><br />**SqlPassword**<br /><br />**ActiveDirectoryPassword**<br /><br />**ActiveDirectoryMsi**<br /><br />**ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal**|Specifies the authentication mode.<br /><br />For more information, see [Connect Using Azure Active Directory Authentication](azure-active-directory.md)|Not set.|
|CharacterSet<br /><br />(not supported in the PDO_SQLSRV driver)|String|Specifies the character set used to send data to the server.<br /><br />Possible values are SQLSRV_ENC_CHAR and UTF-8. For more information, see [How to: Send and Retrieve UTF-8 Data Using Built-In UTF-8 Support](how-to-send-and-retrieve-utf-8-data-using-built-in-utf-8-support.md).|SQLSRV_ENC_CHAR|  
|ColumnEncryption|One of the following strings:<br /><br />**Enabled**<br /><br />**Disabled**<br /><br />A string identifying the attestation protocol and URL for attesting the enclave|Specifies whether the Always Encrypted feature is enabled or not. If an attestation protocol and URL are specified, Always Encrypted with secure enclaves is enabled, provided the other requirements are met as described [here](always-encrypted-secure-enclaves.md).|Disabled|  
|ConnectionPooling|1 or **true** for connection pooling on.<br /><br />0 or **false** for connection pooling off.|Specifies whether the connection is assigned from a connection pool (1 or **true**) or not (0 or **false**).<sup>1</sup>|**true** (1)|  
|ConnectRetryCount|Integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive)|The maximum number of attempts to reestablish a broken connection before giving up. By default, a single attempt is made to reestablish a connection when broken. A value of 0 means that no reconnection will be attempted.|1|  
|ConnectRetryInterval|Integer between 1 and 60 (inclusive)|The time, in seconds, between attempts to reestablish a connection. The application will attempt to reconnect immediately upon detecting a broken connection, and will then wait `ConnectRetryInterval` seconds before trying again.

|Encrypt|1 or **true** for encryption on.<br /><br />0 or **false** for encryption off.|Specifies whether the communication with SQL Server is encrypted (1 or **true**) or unencrypted (0 or **false**)<sup>3</sup>.|**false** (0)|  
|Failover_Partner|String|Specifies the server and instance of the database's mirror (if enabled and configured) to use when the primary server is unavailable.<br /><br />There are restrictions to using `Failover_Partner` with `MultiSubnetFailover`. For more information, see [Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](php-driver-for-sql-server-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md).<br /><br />This option is not supported on Linux or macOS because database mirroring is not supported by the ODBC driver on Linux or macOS. Instead, use Always On availability groups and set the `MultiSubnetFailover` and `TransparentNetworkIPResolution` options.|Not set.|
|FormatDecimals<br /><br />(not supported in the PDO_SQLSRV driver)|1 or **true** to format fetched decimal strings.<br /><br />0 or **false** for default decimal formatting behavior.|Specifies whether to add leading zeroes to decimal strings when appropriate and enables the `DecimalPlaces` option for formatting money types.

|Language|String|Specifies the language of messages returned by the server. The available languages are listed in the `sys.syslanguages` table. <br /><br />This option does not affect the language used by the drivers themselves, as they are currently available only in English, and it does not affect the language of the underlying ODBC driver, whose language is determined by the localized version installed on the client system. Therefore, changing this setting may result in messages being returned in different languages, depending on whether they come from the PHP driver, the ODBC driver, or SQL Server.|The default is the language set in SQL Server.|
|LoginTimeout|Integer (SQLSRV driver)<br /><br />String (PDO_SQLSRV driver)|Specifies the number of seconds to wait before failing the connection attempt.|No timeout.|  
|MultipleActiveResultSets|1 or **true** to use multiple active result sets.<br /><br />0 or **false** to disable multiple active result sets.|Disables or explicitly enables support for multiple active result sets (MARS).<br /><br />For more information, see [How to: Disable Multiple Active Result Sets &#40;MARS&#41;](how-to-disable-multiple-active-resultsets-mars.md).|true (1)|

|Scrollable|String|"buffered" indicates that you want a client-side (buffered) cursor, which allows you to cache an entire result set in memory. For more information, see [Cursor Types &#40;SQLSRV Driver&#41;](cursor-types-sqlsrv-driver.md).|Forward-only cursor|  
|Server<br /><br />(not supported in the SQLSRV driver)|String|The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance to connect to.<br /><br />You can also specify a virtual network name, to connect to an Always On availability group. For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)] support for [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../includes/sshadr-md.md)], see [Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](php-driver-for-sql-server-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md).|Server is a required keyword (although it does not have to be the first keyword in the connection string). If a server name is not passed to the keyword, an attempt is made to connect to the local instance.<br /><br />The value passed to Server can be the name of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance, or the IP address of the instance.

1. The `ConnectionPooling` attribute cannot be used to enable/disable connection pooling in Linux and macOS. See [Connection Pooling (Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server)](connection-pooling-microsoft-drivers-for-php-for-sql-server.md).

2. All queries executed on the established connection are made to the database that is specified by the `Database` attribute. However, if the user has the appropriate permissions, data in other databases can be accessed by using a fully qualified name. For example, if the *master* database is set with the `Database` connection attribute, it is still possible to execute a Transact-SQL query that accesses the *AdventureWorks.HumanResources.Employee* table by using the fully qualified name.  

3. Enabling `Encryption` can impact the performance of some applications due to the computational overhead required to encrypt data.  

4. The `UID` and `PWD` attributes must both be set when connecting with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.  

Many of the supported keys are ODBC connection string attributes. For information about ODBC connection strings, see [Using Connection String Keywords with SQL Native Client](../../relational-databases/native-client/applications/using-connection-string-keywords-with-sql-server-native-client.md).
