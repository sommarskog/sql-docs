# Connection resiliency in the ODBC driver

[!INCLUDE[Driver_ODBC_Download](../../includes/driver_odbc_download.md)]

To ensure that applications remain connected to an [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)], the ODBC driver can restore idle connections.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The connection resiliency feature is supported on Microsoft Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2014 (and later) server versions.
>
> The feature is available on Windows starting with Microsoft ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server. It is available on Linux starting in version 17.2 of Microsoft ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server.

For more information about idle connection resiliency, see [Technical Article - Idle Connection Resiliency](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/2/0/D20E1C5F-72EA-4505-9F26-FEF9550EFD44/Idle%20Connection%20Resiliency.docx).

To control reconnect behavior, the ODBC Driver for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has two options:

- Connection retry count.

  Connect retry count controls the number of reconnection attempts if there's a connection failure. Valid values range from 0 to 255. Zero (0) means don't attempt to reconnect. The default value is one reconnection attempt.

  You can modify the number of connection retries when you:

  - Define or modify a data source that uses the ODBC Driver for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with the **Connection Retry Count** control.

  - Use the `ConnectRetryCount` connection string keyword.

    To retrieve the number of connection retry attempts, use the `SQL_COPT_SS_CONNECT_RETRY_COUNT` (read only) connection attribute. If an application connects to a server that doesn't support connection resiliency, `SQL_COPT_SS_CONNECT_RETRY_COUNT` returns 0.

- Connect retry interval.

  The connect retry interval specifies the number of seconds between each connection retry attempt. Valid values are 1-60. The total time to reconnect can't exceed the connection timeout (SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT in SQLSetStmtAttr). The default value is 10 seconds.

  You can modify the connection retry interval when you:

  - Define or modify a data source that uses the ODBC Driver for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with the **Connect Retry Interval** control.

  - Use the `ConnectRetryInterval` connection string keyword.

    To retrieve the length of the connection retry interval, use the `SQL_COPT_SS_CONNECT_RETRY_INTERVAL` (read only) connection attribute.

If an application establishes a connection with SQL_DRIVER_COMPLETE_REQUIRED and later tries to execute a statement over a broken connection, the ODBC driver won't display the dialog box again. Also, during recovery in progress,

- During recovery, any call to `SQLGetConnectAttr(SQL_COPT_SS_CONNECTION_DEAD)`, must return `SQL_CD_FALSE`.
- If recovery fails, any call to `SQLGetConnectAttr(SQL_COPT_SS_CONNECTION_DEAD)`, must return `SQL_CD_TRUE`.

The following state codes are returned by any function that executes a command on the server:

| State | Message |
|--|--|
| `IMC01` | `The connection is broken and recovery is not possible. The client driver attempted to recover the connection one or more times and all attempts failed. Increase the value of ConnectRetryCount to increase the number of recovery attempts.` |
| `IMC02` | `The server did not acknowledge a recovery attempt, connection recovery is not possible.` |
| `IMC03` | `The server did not preserve the exact client TDS version requested during a recovery attempt, connection recovery is not possible.` |
| `IMC04` | `The server did not preserve the exact server major version requested during a recovery attempt, connection recovery is not possible.` |
| `IMC05` | `The connection is broken and recovery is not possible. The connection is marked by the server as unrecoverable. No attempt was made to restore the connection.` |
| `IMC06` | `The connection is broken and recovery is not possible. The connection is marked by the client driver as unrecoverable. No attempt was made to restore the connection.` |

## Example

The following sample contains two functions. `func1` shows how you can connect with a data source name (DSN) that uses the ODBC Driver for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Windows. The DSN uses [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication, and it specifies the user ID. `func1` then retrieves the number of connection retries with `SQL_COPT_SS_CONNECT_RETRY_COUNT`.

`func2` uses `SQLDriverConnect`, `ConnectRetryCount` connection string keyword, and connection attributes to retrieve the setting for connection retries and retry interval.
