# Installing the Driver Manager
[!INCLUDE[Driver_ODBC_Download](../../../includes/driver_odbc_download.md)]

This article contains instructions to install the unixODBC Driver Manager for use with all the versions of Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server on Linux and macOS.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Delete any driver manager packages installed on your computer before you install the unixODBC Driver Manager. Installing the unixODBC Driver Manager could cause a failure of an existing Driver Manager.  

## Installing the Driver Manager for Microsoft ODBC Driver 13, 13.1, 17, and 18
The driver manager dependency is resolved automatically by the package management system when you install the Microsoft ODBC Driver 13, 13.1, 17, or 18 for SQL Server on Linux or macOS by following the instructions in the following articles:

- [Installing the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server on Linux](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md)
- [Installing the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server on macOS](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/install-microsoft-odbc-driver-sql-server-macos.md)

## Installing the Driver Manager for Microsoft ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server  

(SUSE and Red Hat Linux only.)

**Using the Installation Script**  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> These instructions refer to `msodbcsql-11.0.2270.0.tar.gz`, which is the installation file for Red Hat Linux. If you are installing the Preview for SUSE Linux, the file name is `msodbcsql-11.0.2260.0.tar.gz`.  

To install the driver manager:  
  
1.  Make sure that you have root permission.  
  
2.  Go to the directory where the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ODBC Driver download placed the file called `msodbcsql-11.0.2270.0.tar.gz`. Make sure that you have the \*.tar.gz file that matches your version of Linux. To extract the files, execute the following command: **tar xvzf msodbcsql-11.0.2270.0.tar.gz**.  

3.  Change to the `msodbcsql-11.0.2270.0` directory and there you should see a file called `build_dm.sh`. You can run `build_dm.sh` to install the unixODBC Driver Manager.

4.  To see a list of the available options, execute the following command: **./build_dm.sh --help**.  
  
5.  When you are ready to install, and if your computer can access an external site via FTP, execute the following command: **./build_dm.sh**.

If your computer cannot access an external site via FTP, get `unixODBC-2.3.0.tar.gz`. You can get `unixODBC-2.3.0.tar.gz` from [http://www.unixodbc.org](http://www.unixodbc.org/). Click the **Download** link on the left side of the page to go to the download page. Then click the appropriate link to download unixODBC-2.3.0 (not unixODBC-2.3.1). unixODBC-2.3.1 is not supported with this release of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] ODBC Driver 11 for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Execute the following command to begin the unixODBC Driver Manager installation: **./build_dm.sh --download-url=file://unixODBC-2.3.0.tar.gz**.  

6.  Type **YES** to proceed with unpacking the files. This part of the process can take up to five minutes to complete.  

7.  After the script stops running, follow the instructions on the screen to install the unixODBC Driver Manager.

You are now ready to install the driver. For more information, see the ODBC driver installation instructions for [Linux](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md)
or [macOS](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/install-microsoft-odbc-driver-sql-server-macos.md).

**Manual Installation**

If the installation script is unable to complete, configure and build the proper driver manager yourself.

1.  Remove any older installed version of unixODBC (for example, unixODBC 2.2.11). On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6, execute the following command: **yum remove unixODBC**. On SUSE Linux Enterprise, **zypper remove unixODBC**.  
  
2.  Go to [http://www.unixodbc.org](http://www.unixodbc.org/). Click the **Download** link on the left side of the page to go to the download page. Then click the appropriate link to save the file unixODBC-2.3.0.tar.gz to your computer. UnixODBC-2.3.1 is not supported with this release of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] ODBC Driver 11 for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
3.  On your Linux computer, execute the command: **tar xvzf unixODBC-2.3.0.tar.gz**.  
  
4.  Change to the unixODBC-2.3.0 directory.  
  
5.  At a command prompt, execute the command: **CPPFLAGS="-DSIZEOF_LONG_INT=8"**.  
  
6.  At a command prompt, execute the command: **export CPPFLAGS**.  
  
7.  At a command prompt, execute the command: **"./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64 --sysconfdir=/etc --enable-gui=no --enable-drivers=no --enable-iconv --with-iconv-char-enc=UTF8 --with-iconv-ucode-enc=UTF16LE"**.  
  
8.  At a command prompt (logged in as root), execute the command: **make**.  
  
9. At a command prompt (logged in as root), execute the command: **make install**.  

You are now ready to install the driver. For more information, see the ODBC driver installation instructions for [Linux](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md)
or [macOS](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/install-microsoft-odbc-driver-sql-server-macos.md).
