# Release Notes for the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server on Linux and macOS

[!INCLUDE[Driver_ODBC_Download](../../../includes/driver_odbc_download.md)]

This article lists and describes what's new in the versioned releases of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] ODBC driver for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux and macOS.

<!--
Going forward, please use the new 2-column markdown table for each new H2 version section.
And we are keeping the H2 titles much shorter, partly by removing redundant or obvious info.
We want to track the Month YYYY each new version H2 section is added, at the end of the H2 title.
This is the new standard format for Release Notes article content.

OLD     FILE NAME:    linux-mac/release-notes.md
NOW NEW FILE NAME:    linux-mac/release-notes-odbc-sql-server-linux-mac.md

Thank you.

**Features Added**:

Always Encrypted support for BCP API

New connection string attribute UseFMTOnly causes driver to use legacy metadata in special cases requiring temp tables.

Support for Azure SQL Managed Instance.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a number of differences when using Managed Instance:
>
> - FILESTREAM is not supported
> - Local filesystem access is not supported, but required for things like tracefiles
> - Create UDT from local path is not supported
> - Windows Integrated Authentication is not supported
> - DTC is not supported
> - 'sa' account is not present (default account is called 'cloudSA')
> - TDS token ERROR (0xAA) returns incorrect server name

## 13.1, for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux and macOS, May 2017

ODBC Driver 13.1 for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] adds support for Always Encrypted and Azure Active Directory when used with Microsoft SQL Server 2016.

**New distributions supported**:
OS X 10.11 and macOS 10.12 are supported in the first release of the ODBC Driver on macOS. Ubuntu 16.10 is now also supported, along with Red Hat 6, 7, and SUSE 12. Each platform has a platform-relevant package (RPM or DEB) to ease installation and configuration. For more information, see the ODBC driver installation instructions for [Linux](installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md)
and [macOS](install-microsoft-odbc-driver-sql-server-macos.md).

**unixODBC Driver Manager 2.3.1 Support Changes**: The ODBC driver no longer depends on custom packaging for the unixODBC driver manager (except on Red Hat 6), and instead relies on the distribution package manager to resolve the UnixODBC dependency from the distribution's repositories.

**BCP API Support**: The Linux and macOS ODBC driver now supports the use of the [BCP API functions (**bcp_init**, etc.)](../../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-extensions-bulk-copy-functions/sql-server-driver-extensions-bulk-copy-functions.md)

## 13.0, for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux

With Microsoft ODBC Driver 13.0 for SQL Server, SQL Server 2014 and SQL Server 2016 are now also supported.  

**New distributions supported**:

Ubuntu is now supported, along with Red Hat and SUSE. Each platform has a platform-relevant package (RPM or DEB) to ease installation and configuration.  See [Installing the Driver](installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md) for installation instructions.

**unixODBC Driver Manager 2.3.1 Support**: In addition to a newer driver manager, there's also a package for installing this dependency that eases installation and configuration.  

**Transparent Network IP Resolution**: Transparent Network IP Resolution is a revision of the existing Multi-Subnet Failover feature that affects the connection sequence of the driver in the case where the first resolved IP of the hostname doesn't respond and there are multiple IPs associated with the hostname.

**TLS 1.2 Support**: The Microsoft ODBC Driver 13.0 for SQL Server on Linux now supports TLS 1.2 when secure communications with SQL Server are used.

## 11, for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux

The ODBC driver on SUSE Linux (Preview) supports 64-bit SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 2. For more information, see [System Requirements](system-requirements.md).  

The ODBC driver on Linux supports [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)]. For more information, see [ODBC Driver on Linux Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](odbc-driver-on-linux-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md).  

The ODBC driver on Linux supports connections to Azure SQL Database.

The `-l` option (login timeout) has been added to `bcp`. For more information, see [Connecting with **bcp**](connecting-with-bcp.md).
