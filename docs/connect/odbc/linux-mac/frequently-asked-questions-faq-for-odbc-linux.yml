        answer: |
          **How do existing ODBC applications on Linux or macOS work with the driver?**  
          You should be able to compile and run the ODBC applications that you have been compiling and running on Linux or macOS using other drivers. 
            
          **Which features of [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] does this version of the driver support?**
          
          The ODBC driver on Linux and macOS supports all server features in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] except LocalDB. For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supported features, see [Programming Guidelines](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/programming-guidelines.md).  
            
          **Does the driver support Kerberos authentication?**  
          Yes. If you have an existing Kerberos environment setup, you should be able to connect to servers using the `Trusted_Connection=Yes` DSN or connection string option. For more information, see [Using Integrated Authentication](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/using-integrated-authentication.md).  
            
          **Which Unicode encoding should an application use?**  
          UTF-8 for SQL_CHAR data and UTF-16 for SQL_WCHAR data. Depending on the system locale and driver version, non-UTF-8 data in one of several encodings may also be supported. For more information, see [Programming Guidelines](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/programming-guidelines.md).
          
          **Are there ODBC samples that I can download and run with the driver to experiment with or evaluate it?**
          
          See [Use Existing MSDN C++ ODBC Samples for the ODBC Driver on Linux](/archive/blogs/sqlblog/use-existing-msdn-c-odbc-samples-for-microsoft-linux-odbc-driver) for a sample. This is also applicable to the macOS ODBC driver.
          
          **Is the ODBC driver on Linux or macOS open source?**
          
          No, the ODBC drivers on Linux and macOS are not an open source product.
