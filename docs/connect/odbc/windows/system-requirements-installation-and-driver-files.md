# System requirements, installation, and driver files

This article discusses the ODBC drivers that connect to SQL Server.

## SQL version compatibility

Compatibility indicates that a driver was tested for compatibility against existing releases of SQL at the time of the driver's release. SQL Server releases generally try to maintain backwards compatibility with existing client drivers. But new features in SQL Server releases may not be available with older client drivers.

The driver name that you specify in a connection string is one of the following values:

- `ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server`
- `ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server` (for both 13 and 13.1)
- `ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server`

## Installing Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server

The driver is installed when you run `msodbcsql.msi` from one of the [Downloads for Windows](../download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md#download-for-windows).

> [!NOTE]
> For those who have Driver 17.1.0.1 or below installed, it is recommended that it be uninstalled manually prior to installing the newer version of the Driver.

### Side-by-side with Native Client

The driver can be installed side-by-side with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client. Major versions of the driver (11, 13, 17, 18) can all be installed side-by-side with each other, as well.

When you invoke `msodbcsql.msi`, only the client components are installed by default. The client components are files that support running an application that was developed using the driver. To install the SDK components, specify `ADDLOCAL=ALL` on the command line. Here's an example.

```console
msiexec /i msodbcsql.msi ADDLOCAL=ALL
```

### End-user license

Specify `IACCEPTMSODBCSQLLICENSETERMS=YES` to accept the terms of the end-user license if you use the `/passive`, `/qn`, `/qb`, or `/qr` option to install. This option must be specified in all uppercase letters. Here's an example.

```console
msiexec /quiet /passive /qn /i msodbcsql.msi IACCEPTMSODBCSQLLICENSETERMS=YES ADDLOCAL=ALL
```

### Silent uninstall

The following example shows how to perform a silent uninstall.

```console
msiexec /quiet /passive /qn /uninstall msodbcsql.msi
```

### Indicate dependency

When an application uses the driver, the application should indicate that it depends on the driver through the install option `APPGUID`. this indication enables the driver installer to report dependent applications before uninstalling. To specify a dependency on the driver, set the `APPGUID` command-line parameter to your product code when silently installing the driver. A product code must be created when using Microsoft Installer to bundle your application setup program. Here's an example.

```console
msiexec /i msodbcsql.msi APPGUID={ <Your dependent application's APPGUID> }
```

## Command-line tools: sqlcmd.exe and bcp.exe

The `bcp.exe` and `sqlcmd.exe` tools for use with the driver can be downloaded at [Microsoft Command Line Utilities 11 for SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=36433), [Microsoft Command Line Utilities 13 for SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=52680), or [Microsoft Command Line Utilities 13.1 for SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53591). The driver is a prerequisite to install `sqlcmd.exe` and `bcp.exe`.

`bcp.exe` and `sqlcmd.exe` are installed in the `110\Tools` subfolder of `%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft SQL Server\Client SDK\ODBC` for version 11, and `130\Tools` for 13 and 13.1.

An application that uses BCP functions must specify the driver from the same version, which shipped with the header file and library used to compile the application.

For example, when you compile an ODBC application with `msodbcsql11.lib` and `msodbcsql.h`, use `DRIVER={ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server}` in the connection string.
