# Retrieving result set data sample

[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

This [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] sample application demonstrates how to retrieve a set of data from a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database, and then display that data.

The code file for this sample is named RetrieveResultSet.java, and it can be found in the following location:

```bash
\<installation directory>\sqljdbc_<version>\<language>\samples\resultsets
```

## Requirements

To run this sample application, you must set the classpath to include the mssql-jdbc jar file. You'll also need access to the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] sample database. For more information about how to set the classpath, see [Using the JDBC Driver](using-the-jdbc-driver.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] provides mssql-jdbc class library files to be used depending on your preferred Java Runtime Environment (JRE) settings. For more information about which JAR file to choose, see [System Requirements for the JDBC Driver](system-requirements-for-the-jdbc-driver.md).

## Example

In the following example, the sample code makes a connection to the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] sample database. Then, using an SQL statement with the [SQLServerStatement](reference/sqlserverstatement-class.md) object, it runs the SQL statement and places the data that it returns into a [SQLServerResultSet](reference/sqlserverresultset-class.md) object.

Next, the sample code calls the custom displayRow method to iterate through the rows of data that are in the result set, and uses the [getString](reference/getstring-method-sqlserverresultset.md) method to display some of the data.

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class RetrieveResultSet {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Create a variable for the connection string.
        String connectionUrl = "jdbc:sqlserver://<server>:<port>;encrypt=true;databaseName=AdventureWorks;user=<user>;password=<password>";

        try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionUrl); Statement stmt = con.createStatement();) {
            createTable(stmt);
            String SQL = "SELECT * FROM Production.Product;";
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(SQL);
            displayRow("PRODUCTS", rs);
        }
        // Handle any errors that may have occurred.
        catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private static void displayRow(String title,
            ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
        System.out.println(title);
        while (rs.next()) {
            System.out.println(rs.getString("ProductNumber") + " : " + rs.getString("Name"));
        }
    }

    private static void createTable(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
        stmt.execute("if exists (select * from sys.objects where name = 'Product_JDBC_Sample')"
                + "drop table Product_JDBC_Sample");

        String sql = "CREATE TABLE [Product_JDBC_Sample](" + "[ProductID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,"
