# Working with large data

[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

The JDBC driver provides support for adaptive buffering, which allows you to retrieve any kind of large-value data without the overhead of server cursors. With adaptive buffering, the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] retrieves statement execution results from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] as the application needs them, rather than all at once. The driver also discards the results as soon as the application can no longer access them.

In the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] JDBC Driver version 1.2, the buffering mode was "**full**" by default. If your application did not set the "responseBuffering" connection property to "**adaptive**" either in the connection properties or by using the [setResponseBuffering](reference/setresponsebuffering-method-sqlserverstatement.md) method of the [SQLServerStatement](reference/sqlserverstatement-class.md) object, the driver supported reading the entire result from the server at once. In order to get the adaptive buffering behavior, your application had to set the "responseBuffering" connection property to "**adaptive**" explicitly.

The **adaptive** value is the default buffering mode and the JDBC driver buffers the minimum possible data when necessary. For more information about using adaptive buffering, see [Using adaptive buffering](using-adaptive-buffering.md).

 The topics in this section describe different ways that you can use to retrieve large-value data from a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database.
