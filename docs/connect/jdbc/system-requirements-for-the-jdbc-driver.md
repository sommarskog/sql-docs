# System requirements for the JDBC driver

[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

  To use the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] to access data from a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)], you must have the following components installed on your computer:

- [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] ([download](download-microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server.md))
- Java Runtime Environment

## Java Runtime Environment requirements  

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 12.4 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 20.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 20.0 are supported.
 
 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 12.2 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 19.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 19.0 are supported.

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 11.2 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 18.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 18.0 are supported.

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 10.2 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 17.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 17.0 are supported.

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 9.4 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 16.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 16.0 are supported.

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 9.2 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 15.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 15.0 are supported.

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 8.4 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 14.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 14.0 are supported.

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 8.2 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 13.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 13.0 are supported.

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 7.4 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 12.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 12.0 are supported.

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 7.2 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 11.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 11.0 are supported.

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 7.0 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 10.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 10.0 are supported.

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.4 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 9.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 9.0 are supported.

 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.2 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 8.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8.0 are supported. Support for JDBC Spec API has been extended to include the JDBC 4.1 and 4.2 API.
  
 As of Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.1 for SQL Server, Java Development Kit (JDK) 7.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 7.0 are supported.
  
 As of [!INCLUDE[jdbc_40](../../includes/jdbc_40_md.md)], the JDBC driver support for JDBC Spec API has been extended to include the JDBC 4.0 API. The JDBC 4.0 API was introduced as part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) 6.0 and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6.0. JDBC 4.0 is a superset of the JDBC 3.0 API.
  
 When you deploy the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] on Windows and UNIX operating systems, you must use the installation packages, *sqljdbc_\<version>_enu.exe*, and *sqljdbc_\<version>_enu.tar.gz*, respectively.

  The JDBC Driver 6.2 includes two JAR class libraries in each installation package: **mssql-jdbc-6.2.2.jre7.jar**, and **mssql-jdbc-6.2.2.jre8.jar**.
  
 The JDBC Driver 6.2 is designed to work with, and supports all major Java virtual machines, but is tested only on Sun JRE 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0.
  
 The following chart summarizes support provided by the two JAR files included with Microsoft JDBC Drivers 6.0 and 4.2 for SQL Server:  
  
|JAR|JDBC Version Compliance|Recommended Java Version|Description|  
|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
|mssql-jdbc-6.2.2.jre7.jar|4.1|7|Requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 7.0. Using JRE 6.0 or lower throws an exception.<br /><br /> New Features in 6.2 include: Azure AD authentication for Linux, Principal/Password method for Kerberos, automatic detection of REALM in SPN for Cross-Domain authentication, Kerberos Constrained Delegation, Query Timeout, Socket Timeout, and prepared statement handle reuse. |  
|mssql-jdbc-6.2.3.jre8.jar|4.2|8|Requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8.0. Using JRE 7.0 or lower throws an exception.<br /><br /> New Features in 6.2 include: Azure AD authentication for Linux, Principal/Password method for Kerberos, automatic detection of REALM in SPN for Cross-Domain authentication, Kerberos Constrained Delegation, Query Timeout, Socket Timeout, and prepared statement handle reuse|  

  The JDBC Driver 6.2 is available on the Maven Central Repository and can be added to a Maven project with the following code in the POM.XML
  
 ```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.sqlserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>mssql-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>6.2.2.jre8</version>
</dependency>
```

 **Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 and 4.2 for SQL Server:**  
  
  The JDBC Drivers 6.0 and 4.2 include two JAR class libraries in each installation package: **sqljdbc41.jar**, and **sqljdbc42.jar**.
  
 The JDBC Drivers 6.0 and 4.2 are designed to work with, and supports all major Java virtual machines, but is tested only on Sun JRE 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0.
  
 The following chart summarizes support provided by the two JAR files included with Microsoft JDBC Drivers 6.0 and 4.2 for SQL Server:  
  
|JAR|JDBC Version Compliance|Recommended Java Version|Description|  
|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|  
|sqljdbc41.jar|4.1|7|Requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 7.0. Using JRE 6.0 or lower throws an exception.<br /><br /> New Features in 6.0 & 4.2 packages include: JDBC 4.1 Compliance and Bulk Copy<br /><br /> In Addition, new Features in only the 6.0 package include: Always Encrypted, Table-Valued Parameters, Azure Active Directory Authentication, transparent connections to Always On Availability Groups, improvement in parameter metadata retrieval  for prepared queries and Internationalized Domain Name (IDN)|  
|sqljdbc42.jar|4.2|8|Requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8.0. Using JRE 7.0 or lower throws an exception.<br /><br /> New Features in 6.0 & 4.2 packages include: JDBC 4.1 Compliance, JDBC 4.2 Compliance, and Bulk Copy<br /><br /> In Addition, new Features in only the 6.0 package include: Always Encrypted, Table-Valued Parameters, Azure Active Directory Authentication, transparent connections to Always On Availability Groups, improvement in parameter metadata retrieval  for prepared queries and Internationalized Domain Name (IDN)|  
  
 **Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.1 for SQL Server:**  
  
 The JDBC Driver 4.1 includes one JAR class library in each installation package: **sqljdbc41.jar**.  

|JAR|Description|  
|---------|-----------------|  
|sqljdbc41.jar|**sqljdbc41.jar** class library provides support for JDBC 4.0 API. It includes all of the features of the JDBC 4.0 driver and the JDBC 4.0 API methods. JDBC 4.1 isn't supported (throws an exception "SQLFeatureNotSupportedException").<br /><br /> **sqljdbc41.jar** class library requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 7.0. Using **sqljdbc41.jar** on JRE 6.0 and 5.0 throws an exception.<br /><br />
  
 The JDBC driver is designed to work with, and supports all major Java virtual machines, but is tested on Sun JRE 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0.
  
 The following chart summarizes support provided by the JAR file included with Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.1 for SQL Server.  
  
|JAR|JDBC Version|JRE (can run)|JDK (can compile)|  
|---------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|  
|sqljdbc41.jar|4|7|7 6 5|  
  
## SQL Server requirements  

 The JDBC driver supports connections to Azure SQL database and SQL Server. For Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.2 and 4.1 for SQL Server, support begins with SQL Server 2008.
  
## Operating System requirements  

 The JDBC driver is designed to work on any operating system that supports the use of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). However, only Sun Solaris, SUSE Linux, Ubuntu Linux, CentOS Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems have officially been tested.  
  
## Supported languages  

 The JDBC driver supports all [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] column collations. For more information about the collations supported by the JDBC driver, see [International features of the JDBC driver](international-features-of-the-jdbc-driver.md).  
  
 For more information about collations, see "Working with Collations" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.
