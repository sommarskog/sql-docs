# &lt; (Less Than) (MDX)


  Performs a comparison operation that determines whether the value of one Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression is less than the value of another MDX expression.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
MDX_Expression < MDX_Expression  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *MDX_Expression*  
 A valid MDX expression.  
  
## Return Value  
 A Boolean value based on the following conditions:  
  
-   **true** if both parameters are non-null, and the first parameter has a value that is lower than the value of the second parameter.  
  
-   **false** if both parameters are non-null, and the first parameter has a value that is either equal to or greater than the value of the second parameter.  
  
-   null if either or both parameters evaluate to a null value.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the use of this operator.  
  
```  
-- This query returns the gross profit margin (GPM)  
-- for clothing sales where the GPM is less than 30%.  
With Member [Measures].[LowGPM] as  
  IIF(  
      [Measures].[Gross Profit Margin] < .3,  
      [Measures].[Gross Profit Margin],  
      null)  
SELECT NON EMPTY  
    [Sales Territory].[Sales Territory Country].Members ON 0,  
    [Product].[Category].[Clothing] ON 1  
FROM  
    [Adventure Works]  
WHERE  
    ([Measures].[LowGPM])  
```
