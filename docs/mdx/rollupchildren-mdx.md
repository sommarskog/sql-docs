# RollupChildren (MDX)


  Returns a value generated by rolling up the values of the children of a specified member using the specified unary operator.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
RollupChildren(Member_Expression, Unary_Operator)   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Member_Expression*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a member.  
  
 *Unary_Operator*  
 A valid string expression that specifies a unary operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 The **RollupChildren** function rolls up the values of the children of the specified member using the specified unary operator.  
  
 The following table describes the valid unary operators for this function.  
  
|Operator|Result|  
|--------------|------------|  
|**+**|total = total + current child|  
|**-**|total = total - current child|  
|**\***|total = total * current child|  
|**/**|total = total / current child|  
|**%**|total = (total / current child) * 100|  
|**~**|The child is not used in the rollup. Its value is ignored.|  
  
 If the operator in the member property does not appear in the list, an error occurs. The order of evaluation is determined by the order of the siblings, not by the precedence of the operators.  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses a member property called "Alternate Rollup Operator" that contains alternate values for unary operators to rollup up children of the Net Profit hierarchy in the Account dimension in an alternate manner. This member property does not exist in the Adventure Works cube, but could be created. This use of the **RollupChildren** function could be used in a budgeting application for what-if analysis.  
  
```  
RollupChildren  
   ( [Account].[Net Profit]  
   , [Account].CurrentMember.Properties ('Alternate Rollup Operator') )  
```
