# Leaves (MDX)


  Returns a set composed of all attributes (optionally limited to those belonging to a specific dimension). For each attribute x in the return set, if x is the granularity attribute or is directly or indirectly related to the granularity attribute, the granularity is set on attribute x without affecting the slice. The **Leaves** function is designed for use inside a SCOPE statement or at the left side of an assignment.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Leaves( [ Dimension_expression ] )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Dimension_Expression*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a dimension.  
  
## Remarks  
 Leaf members are tuples that are formed by the cross join of the lowest level of all attribute hierarchies. Calculated members are excluded.  
  
-   If a dimension name is specified, the **Leaves** function returns a set that contains the leaf members of the key attribute for the specified dimension.  
  
-   If the dimension is associated with multiple measure groups, that of the measure in the current scope is used.  
  
-   If a dimension name is not specified, the function returns a set that contains the leaf members of the entire cube.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the dimension expression resolves to a hierarchy, and the hierarchy unique name is the same as the dimension unique name (cube dimension property HierarchyUniqueNameStyle=ExcludeDimensionName, and the hierarchy name=dimension name), then the dimension is used.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  An error is generated if not all attributes have same granularity on measure groups in current scope.
