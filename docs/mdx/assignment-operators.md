# Assignment Operators


  In Multidimensional Expressions (MDX), the assignment operator is the equal sign (=).  
  
 The assignment operator is used to assign values to subcubes in MDX Script. For more information, see [MDX Scripting Fundamentals &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](/analysis-services/multidimensional-models/mdx/mdx-scripting-fundamentals-analysis-services).
