```  
  
MDX_Expression <= MDX_Expression  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *MDX_Expression*  
 A valid MDX expression.  
  
## Return Value  
 A Boolean value based on the following conditions:  
  
-   t**rue** if both parameters are non-null, and the first parameter has a value that is either less than or equal to the value of the second parameter.  
  
-   f**alse** if both parameters are non-null, and the first parameter has a value that greater than the value of the second parameter.  
  
-   null if either or both parameters evaluate to a null value.

```  
-- This query returns the gross profit margin (GPM)  
-- for Australia where the GPM is less than or equal to 30%.  
With Member [Measures].[LowGPM] as  
  IIF(  
      [Measures].[Gross Profit Margin] <= .5,  
      [Measures].[Gross Profit Margin],  
      null)  
SELECT   
NON EMPTY [Sales Territory].[Sales Territory Country].[Australia] ON 0,

    [Adventure Works]  
WHERE  
    ([Measures].[LowGPM])
