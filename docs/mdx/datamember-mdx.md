# DataMember (MDX)


  Returns the system-generated data member that is associated with a nonleaf member of a dimension.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Member_Expression.DataMember  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Member_Expression*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a member.  
  
## Remarks  
 This function operates on nonleaf members in any hierarchy and can be used by the [UPDATE CUBE Statement (MDX)](../mdx/mdx-data-manipulation-update-cube.md) command to writeback data to a nonleaf member directly, rather than to the leaf member's descendants.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Returns the specified member if the specified member is a leaf member, or if the nonleaf member does not have an associated data member.  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the **DataMember** function in a calculated measure to show the sales quota for each individual employee:  
  
```  
WITH MEMBER measures.InvidualQuota AS   
([Employee].[Employees].currentmember.datamember, [Measures].[Sales Amount Quota])  
,FORMAT_STRING='Currency'  
SELECT {[Measures].[Sales Amount Quota],[Measures].InvidualQuota} ON COLUMNS,  
[Employee].[Employees].MEMBERS ON ROWS  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
```
