# TupleToStr (MDX)


  Returns a Multidimensional Expressions (MDX)-formatted string that corresponds to a specified tuple.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
TupleToStr(Tuple_Expression)   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Tuple_Expression*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a tuple.  
  
## Remarks  
 This function is used to transfer a string-representation of a tuple to an external function for parsing. The string that is returned is enclosed in braces {} and each member, if more than one is expressly defined in the tuple, is separated by a comma.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example returns the string ([Date].[Calendar Year].&[2001],[Geography].[Geography].[Country].&[United States]) :  
  
```  
WITH MEMBER Measures.x AS TupleToStr   
   (   
      ([Date].[Calendar Year].&[2001]  
         , [Geography].[Geography].[Country].&[United States]  
      )  
   )     
SELECT Measures.x ON 0  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
```  
  
 The following example returns the same string as the previous example.  
  
```  
WITH SET s AS   
   {  
      ([Date].[Calendar Year].&[2001],  
         [Geography].[Geography].[Country].&[United States]  
      )   
   }  
MEMBER Measures.x AS TupleToStr ( s.Item(0) )  
SELECT Measures.x ON 0  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
```
