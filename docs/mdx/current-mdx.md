# Current (MDX)


  Returns the current tuple from a set during iteration.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Set_Expression.Current   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Set_Expression*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a set.  
  
## Remarks  
 At each step during an iteration, the tuple being operated upon is the current tuple. The **Current** function returns that tuple. This function is only valid during an iteration over a set.  
  
 MDX functions that iterate through a set include the [Generate](../mdx/generate-mdx.md) function.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This function only works with sets that are named, either using a set alias or by defining a named set.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows how to use the **Current** function inside **Generate**:  
  
 `WITH`  
  
 `//Creates a set of tuples consisting of all Calendar Years crossjoined with`  
  
 `//all Product Categories`  
  
 `SET MyTuples AS CROSSJOIN(`  
  
 `[Date].[Calendar Year].[Calendar Year].MEMBERS,`  
  
 `[Product].[Category].[Category].MEMBERS)`  
  
 `//Iterates through each tuple in the set and returns the name of the Calendar`  
  
 `//Year in each tuple`  
  
 `MEMBER MEASURES.CURRENTDEMO AS`  
  
 `GENERATE(MyTuples, MyTuples.CURRENT.ITEM(0).NAME, ", ")`  
  
 `SELECT MEASURES.CURRENTDEMO ON 0`  
  
 `FROM [Adventure Works]`
