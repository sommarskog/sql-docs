# Except (MDX) function


  Evaluates two sets and removes those tuples in the first set that also exist in the second set, optionally retaining duplicates.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Except(Set_Expression1, Set_Expression2 [, ALL ] )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Set_Expression1*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a set.  
  
 *Set_Expression2*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a set.  
  
## Remarks  
 If **ALL** is specified, the function retains duplicates found in the first set; duplicates found in the second set will still be removed. The members are returned in the order they appear in the first set.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the use of this function.  
  
```  
   //This query shows the quantity of orders for all products,  
   //with the exception of Components, which are not  
   //sold.  
SELECT   
   [Date].[Month of Year].Children  ON COLUMNS,  
   Except  
      ([Product].[Product Categories].[All].Children ,  
         {[Product].[Product Categories].[Components]}  
      ) ON ROWS  
FROM  
   [Adventure Works]  
WHERE  
   ([Measures].[Order Quantity])  
```
