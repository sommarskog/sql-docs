# Comment (MDX)


  Indicates comment text that is provided by the user.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
/* Comment_Text */      
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *Comment_Text*  
 The string that contains the text of the comment.  
  
## Remarks  
 The server does not evaluate the text between the comment characters, /* and \*/. Comments can be inserted on a separate line or within a Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) statement. Multiple-line comments must be indicated by /\* and \*/.  
  
 There is no maximum length for comments. Comments can be nested; for example, `/* Test /*Comment*/ Text*/` is an example of a nested comment.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the use of this operator.  
  
```  
/* This member returns the gross profit margin for product types  
  and reseller types crossjoined by year. */  
SELECT   
    [Date].[Calendar].[Calendar Year].Members *  
    [Reseller].[Reseller Type].Children ON 0,  
    [Product].[Category].[Category].Members ON 1  
FROM /* Select from the Adventure Works cube. */  
    [Adventure Works]  
WHERE  
    [Measures].[Gross Profit Margin]  
```
