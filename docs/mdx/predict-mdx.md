## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Predict(Mining_Model_Name,String_Expression)   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Mining_Model_Name*  
 A valid string expression that represents the name of a mining model.  
  
 *String_Expression*  
 A valid string expression that evaluates to a valid DMX expression for the specified mining model.  
  
## Remarks

 Data mining syntax and functions are documented in Data Mining Expressions (DMX) reference.

 The following example predicts name of the cluster and the distance from it of a particular customer using the Customer Clusters mining model:  
  
```  
WITH MEMBER MEASURES.CLNAME AS   
PREDICT("Customer Clusters", "Cluster()")  
MEMBER MEASURES.CLDISTANCE AS   
PREDICT("Customer Clusters", "ClusterDistance(Cluster())")  
SELECT {MEASURES.CLNAME, MEASURES.CLDISTANCE} ON 0
