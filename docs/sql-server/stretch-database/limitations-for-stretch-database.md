# Limitations for Stretch Database

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016-windows-only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-windows-only.md)]

Learn about limitations for Stretch-enabled tables, and about limitations that currently prevent you from enabling Stretch for a table.

## Limitations for Stretch-enabled tables

Stretch-enabled tables have the following limitations.

### Constraints

- Uniqueness isn't enforced for UNIQUE constraints and PRIMARY KEY constraints in the Azure table that contains the migrated data.

### DML operations

- You can't UPDATE or DELETE rows that have been migrated, or rows that are eligible for migration, in a Stretch-enabled table or in a view that includes Stretch-enabled tables.

- You can't INSERT rows into a Stretch-enabled table on a linked server.

### Indexes

- You can't create an index for a view that includes Stretch-enabled tables.

- Filters on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] indexes aren't propagated to the remote table.

## Limitations that currently prevent you from enabling Stretch for a table

The following items currently prevent you from enabling Stretch for a table.

### Table properties

- Tables that have more than 1,023 columns or more than 998 indexes

- FileTables or tables that contain FILESTREAM data

- Tables that are replicated, or that are actively using Change Tracking or Change Data Capture

- Memory-optimized tables

### Data types

- **text**, **ntext** and **image**
- **timestamp**
- **sql_variant**
- **xml**
- CLR data types including **geometry**, **geography**, **hierarchyid**, and CLR user-defined types

### Column types

- COLUMN_SET

- Computed columns

### Constraints

- Default constraints and check constraints

- Foreign key constraints that reference the table. In a parent-child relationship (for example, Order and Order_Detail), you can enable Stretch for the child table (Order_Detail) but not for the parent table (Order).

### Indexes

- Full text indexes

- XML indexes

- Spatial indexes

- Indexed views that reference the table
