## Security

| New feature or update | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration | Protect your SQL servers using the Defender for SQL plan. Defender for SQL plan requires that SQL Server Extension for Azure is enabled and includes functionalities for discovering and mitigating potential database vulnerabilities and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate a threat to your databases. [Learn more](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-introduction) on how Defender for SQL can protect your entire database estate anywhere: on-premises, hybrid, and multicloud environments.
| Microsoft Purview integration | Apply Microsoft Purview access policies to any SQL Server instance that is enrolled in both Azure Arc and the Microsoft Purview Data Use Management.<br /><br />- Newly introduced *SQL Performance Monitor*, and *SQL Security Auditor* roles align with the principle of least privilege using Microsoft Purview access policies.<br /><br />Check out [Provision access by data owner for Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server](/azure/purview/how-to-policies-data-owner-arc-sql-server) for details. |
| Ledger | The ledger feature provides tamper-evidence capabilities in your database. You can cryptographically attest to other parties, such as auditors or other business parties, that your data hasn't been tampered with. See [Ledger](../relational-databases/security/ledger/ledger-overview.md). |
| Azure Active Directory authentication | Use [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication](../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/azure-ad-authentication-sql-server-overview.md) to connect to SQL Server.  <br /><br /> Starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2022](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] Cumulative Update 6, you can configure [Transactional and Snapshot Replication with Azure Active Directory authentication](../relational-databases/replication/configure-replication-with-azure-ad-authentication.md).  |
| Always encrypted with secure enclaves | Support for JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY, and for text columns using UTF-8 collations in confidential queries using enclaves. Improved performance. See [Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](../relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves.md). |
| Access Control: Permissions | New [granular permissions](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/new-granular-permissions-for-sql-server-2022-and-azure-sql-to/ba-p/3607507) improve adherence with the [Principle of Least Privilege](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sql-blog/security-the-principle-of-least-privilege-polp/ba-p/2067390)<br /><br />Read here for an in-depth explanation of the [revamped SQL Permission system for Principle of Least Privilege and external policies](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sql-blog/revamped-sql-permission-system-for-principle-of-least-privilege/ba-p/3639399) |
| Access Control: Server-level Roles | New [built-in server-level roles](../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/server-level-roles.md#fixed-server-level-roles-introduced-in-sql-server-2022) enable least privileged access for administrative tasks that apply to the whole SQL Server Instance |
| Dynamic data masking | Granular UNMASK permissions for [Dynamic Data Masking](../relational-databases/security/dynamic-data-masking.md#granular). |
| Support for PFX certificates, and other cryptographic improvements | New support for import and export of PFX file formatted [certificates](../t-sql/statements/create-certificate-transact-sql.md) and private keys. Ability to [backup](../t-sql/statements/backup-master-key-transact-sql.md) and [restore](../t-sql/statements/restore-master-key-transact-sql.md) master keys to Azure Blob Storage. SQL Server-generated certificates now have a default RSA key size of 3072-bits.<br /><br />Added [BACKUP SYMMETRIC KEY](../t-sql/statements/backup-symmetric-key-transact-sql.md) and [RESTORE SYMMETRIC KEY](../t-sql/statements/restore-symmetric-key-transact-sql.md).<br /><br />See also, [BACKUP CERTIFICATE (Transact-SQL)](../t-sql/statements/backup-certificate-transact-sql.md). |
| Support MS-TDS 8.0 protocol | New MS-TDS protocol iteration. See [TDS 8.0 support](../relational-databases/security/networking/tds-8.md) and [TLS 1.3 support](../relational-databases/security/networking/tls-1-3.md):<br />- Makes encryption mandatory<br />- Aligns MS-TDS with HTTPS making it manageable by network appliances for additional security<br />- Removes MS-TDS / TLS custom interleaving and enables usage of TLS 1.3 and subsequent TLS protocol versions. |

## Performance

| New feature or update | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| System page latch concurrency enhancements | Concurrent updates to global allocation map (GAM) pages and shared global allocation map (SGAM) pages reduce page latch contention while allocating/deallocating data pages and extents. These enhancements apply to all user databases and especially benefit `tempdb` heavy workloads. |
| Buffer pool parallel scan | Improves the performance of buffer pool scan operations on large-memory machines by utilizing multiple CPU cores. Learn more about [Operations that trigger a buffer pool scan may run slowly on large-memory computers](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2132602). |
| Ordered clustered columnstore index | Ordered clustered columnstore index (CCI) sorts the existing data in memory before the index builder compresses the data into index segments. This has the potential of more efficient segment elimination, resulting in better performance as the number of segments to read from disk is reduced. For more information, see [CREATE COLUMNSTORE INDEX (Transact-SQL)](../t-sql/statements/create-columnstore-index-transact-sql.md) and [What's new in columnstore indexes](../relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-what-s-new.md).<br /><br />Also available in Synapse Analytics. See [Query performance](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/performance-tuning-ordered-cci#query-performance). |
| Improved columnstore segment elimination | All columnstore indexes benefit from enhanced segment elimination by data type. Data type choices may have a significant impact on query performance based common filter predicates for queries on the columnstore index. This segment elimination applied to numeric, date, and time data types, and the datetimeoffset data type with scale less than or equal to two. Beginning in [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)], segment elimination capabilities extend to string, binary, guid data types, and the datetimeoffset data type for scale greater than two. |
| In-memory OLTP management | Improve memory management in large memory servers to reduce out-of-memory conditions. |
| Virtual log file growth | In previous versions of SQL Server, if the next growth is more than 1/8 of the current log size, and the growth is less than 64MB, four VLFs were created. In [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)], this behavior is slightly different. Only one VLF is created if the growth is less than or equal to 64 MB and more than 1/8 of the current log size. For more information on VLF growth, see [Virtual Log Files (VLFs)](../relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-log-architecture-and-management-guide.md#virtual-log-files-vlfs). |
| Thread management | - `ParallelRedoThreadPool`: Instance level thread pool shared with all databases having redo work. With this, each database can take the benefit of parallel redo. The parallel redo thread pool allows multiple threads to process the log records of one database at the same time (in parallel). In previous versions, the number of available threads for redo was limited to 100.<br /><br />- `ParallelRedoBatchRedo`: Redo of log records are batched under one latch improving speed. This improves recovery, catchup redo, and crash recovery redo. |
|Reduced buffer pool I/O promotions | Reduced the incidents of a single page being promoted to eight pages when populating the buffer pool from storage, causing unnecessary I/O. The buffer pool can be populated more efficiently by the read-ahead mechanism. This change was introduced in SQL Server 2022 (all editions) and included in [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssazuremi_md](../includes/ssazuremi_md.md)]. |
| Enhanced spinlock algorithms | Spinlocks are a huge part of the consistency inside the engine for multiple threads. Internal adjustments to the Database Engine make spinlocks more efficient. This change was introduced in SQL Server 2022 (all editions) and included in [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssazuremi_md](../includes/ssazuremi_md.md)]. |
| Improved virtual log file (VLF) algorithms | Virtual File Log (VLF) is an abstraction of the physical transaction log. Having a large number of small VLFs based on log growth can affect performance of operations like recovery. We changed the algorithm for how many VLF files we create during certain log grow scenarios. To read more about how we have changed this algorithm in [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)], see [Virtual Log Files (VLFs)](../relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-log-architecture-and-management-guide.md#virtual-log-files-vlfs). This change was introduced in SQL Server 2022 (all editions) and included in [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]. |
| Instant file initialization for transaction log file growth events | In general, transaction log files cannot benefit from instant file initialization (IFI). Starting with [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] (all editions) and in [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)], instant file initialization can benefit transaction log *growth events* up to 64 MB. The default auto growth size increment for new databases is 64 MB. Transaction log file autogrowth events larger than 64 MB cannot benefit from instant file initialization.  For more information, see [Database Instant File Initialization](../relational-databases/databases/database-instant-file-initialization.md).|

## Query Store and intelligent query processing

The [intelligent query processing (IQP)](../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md) feature family includes features that improve the performance of existing workloads with minimal implementation effort.

:::image type="content" source="../relational-databases/performance/media/iqp-feature-family.svg" alt-text="A diagram of the Intelligent Query Processing family of features and when they were first introduced to SQL Server.":::

| New feature or update | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| Query Store on secondary replicas | Query Store on secondary replicas enables the same Query Store functionality on secondary replica workloads that is available for primary replicas. Learn more in [Query Store for secondary replicas](../relational-databases/performance/query-store-for-secondary-replicas.md).<br /><br />For more information, see [Query Store improvements](#query-store-improvements) later in this article. |
| Query Store hints | [Query Store hints](../relational-databases/performance/query-store-hints.md) leverage the Query Store to provide a method to shape query plans without changing application code. Previously only available on Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance, Query Store hints are now available in [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)]. Requires the Query Store to be enabled and in "Read write" mode. |
| Memory grant feedback | Memory grant feedback adjusts the size of the memory allocated for a query based on past performance. [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] introduces [Percentile and Persistence mode memory grant feedback](../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing-feedback.md#percentile-and-persistence-mode-memory-grant-feedback). Requires enabling Query Store.<br /><br />- **Persistence**: A capability that allows the memory grant feedback for a given cached plan to be persisted in the Query Store so that feedback can be reused after cache evictions. Persistence benefits memory grant feedback as well as the new DOP and CE feedback features.<br />- **Percentile**: A new algorithm improves performance of queries with widely oscillating memory requirements, using memory grant information from several previous query executions over, instead of just the memory grant from the immediately preceding query execution. Requires enabling Query Store. Query Store is enabled by default for newly created databases as of SQL Server 2022 CTP 2.1. |
| Parameter sensitive plan optimization | Automatically enables multiple, active cached plans for a single parameterized statement. Cached execution plans accommodate largely different data sizes based on the customer-provided runtime parameter value(s). For more information, see [Parameter Sensitive Plan optimization](../relational-databases/performance/parameter-sensitive-plan-optimization.md). |
| Degree of parallelism (DOP) feedback | A new database scoped configuration option `DOP_FEEDBACK` automatically adjusts degree of parallelism for repeating queries to optimize for workloads where inefficient parallelism can cause performance issues. Similar to optimizations in Azure SQL Database. Requires the Query Store to be enabled and in "Read write" mode.<br /><br />Beginning with RC 0, every query recompilation SQL Server compares the runtime stats of the query using existing feedback to the runtime stats of the previous compilation with the existing feedback. If the performance isn't the same or better, we clear all DOP feedback and trigger a reanalysis of the query starting from the compiled DOP.<br /><br />See [Degree of parallelism (DOP) feedback](../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing-feedback.md#degree-of-parallelism-dop-feedback). |
| Cardinality estimation feedback | Identifies and corrects suboptimal query execution plans for repeating queries, when these issues are caused by incorrect estimation model assumptions. Requires the Query Store to be enabled and in "Read write" mode. See [Cardinality estimation (CE) feedback](../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing-feedback.md#cardinality-estimation-ce-feedback). |
| Optimized plan forcing | Uses compilation replay to improve the compilation time for forced plan generation by pre-caching non-repeatable plan compilation steps. Learn more in [Optimized plan forcing with Query Store](../relational-databases/performance/optimized-plan-forcing-query-store.md). |

## Management

| New feature or update | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| Integrated setup experience for the Azure extension for SQL Server | Install the Azure extension for SQL Server at setup. Required for Azure integration features. For more information, see:<br />- [Install SQL Server from the Command Prompt](../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt.md#install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt)<br />- [Install SQL Server from the Installation Wizard (Setup)](../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-installation-wizard-setup.md?view=sql-server-ver16&preserve-view=true). |
| Manage Azure extension for SQL Server | Use SQL Server Configuration Manager to manage Azure extension for SQL Server service. Required to create Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server instance, and for other Azure connected features. See [SQL Server Configuration Manager](../relational-databases/sql-server-configuration-manager.md). |
| Max server memory calculations | During setup, SQL Setup recommends a value for max server memory to align with documented recommendations. The underlying calculation is different in [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] to reflect recommended [server memory configuration options](../database-engine/configure-windows/server-memory-server-configuration-options.md). |
| Accelerated Database Recovery (ADR) improvements | There are several improvements to address persistent version store (PVS) storage and improve overall scalability. [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] implements a persistent version store cleaner thread per database instead of per instance and the memory footprint for PVS page tracker has been improved. There are also several ADR efficiency improvements, such as concurrency improvements that help the cleanup process to work more efficiently. ADR cleans pages that couldn't previously be cleaned due to locking.<br /><br />See [ADR improvements in SQL Server 2022 (16.x)](../relational-databases/accelerated-database-recovery-concepts.md#adr-improvements-in-). |
| Improved snapshot backup support | Adds Transact-SQL support for freezing and thawing I/O without requiring a VDI client. [Create a Transact-SQL snapshot backup](../relational-databases/backup-restore/create-a-transact-sql-snapshot-backup.md). |
| Shrink database WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY | In previous releases, shrinking databases and database files to reclaim space often leads to concurrency issues. [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] adds WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY as an additional option for shrink operations (DBCC SHRINKDATABASE and DBCC SHRINKFILE). When you specify WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY, new queries requiring Sch-S or Sch-M locks aren't blocked by the waiting shrink operation, until the shrink operation stops waiting and begins executing. See [Shrink a database](../relational-databases/databases/shrink-a-database.md) and [Shrink a file](../relational-databases/databases/shrink-a-file.md). |
| XML compression | XML compression provides a method to compress off-row XML data for both XML columns and indexes, improving capacity requirements. For more information, see [CREATE TABLE (Transact-SQL)](../t-sql/statements/create-table-transact-sql.md) and [CREATE INDEX (Transact-SQL)](../t-sql/statements/create-index-transact-sql.md). |
| Asynchronous auto update statistics concurrency | Avoid potential concurrency issues using asynchronous statistics update if you enable the ASYNC_STATS_UPDATE_WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY [database-scoped configuration](../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md). |
| Backup and restore to S3-compatible object storage | [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] extends the `BACKUP`/`RESTORE` `TO`/`FROM` `URL` syntax by adding support for a new S3 connector using the REST API. See [backup to URL](../relational-databases/backup-restore/sql-server-backup-to-url-s3-compatible-object-storage.md). |

## Platform

| New feature or update | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| SQL Server Native Client (SNAC) has been removed | [!INCLUDE[snac-removed-oledb-and-odbc](../includes/snac-removed-oledb-and-odbc.md)] |
| Hybrid buffer pool with direct write | Reduces the number of `memcpy` commands that need to be performed on modified data or index pages residing on PMEM devices. This *enlightenment* is now available for Window 2022 as well as Linux. For details, see [Hybrid buffer pool with direct write](../database-engine/configure-windows/hybrid-buffer-pool.md#hybrid-buffer-pool-with-direct-write) and [Configure persistent memory (PMEM) for SQL Server on Windows](../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-persistent-memory.md). |
| Integrated acceleration & offloading | [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2022](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] leverages acceleration technologies from partners such as Intel to provide extended capabilities. At release, Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology (QAT) provides backup compression and hardware offloading. For more information, see [Integrated acceleration & offloading](../relational-databases/integrated-acceleration/overview.md). |
| Improved optimization | [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2022](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] leverages new hardware capabilities, including the Advanced Vector Extension (AVX) 512 extension to improve batch mode operations. Requires trace flag 15097. See [DBCC TRACEON - Trace Flags (Transact-SQL)](../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md#tf15097). |

## Language

### Query Store improvements

Query Store helps you better track performance history, troubleshoot query plan related issues, and enable new capabilities in [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssazuremi_md](../includes/ssazuremi_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)]. CTP 2.1 introduces Query Store enabled by default for new databases. If you need to enable the query store, see [Enable the Query Store](../relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store.md#Enabling).

- For databases that have been restored from other SQL Server instances and for those databases that are upgraded from an in-place upgrade to [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)], these databases will retain the previous Query Store settings.

- For databases that are restored from previous SQL Server instances, separately evaluate the [database compatibility level settings](../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-compatibility-level.md) as some Intelligent Query Processing features are enabled by the compatibility level setting.

If there's concern about the overhead Query Store may introduce, administrators can use custom capture policies to further tune what the Query Store captures. Custom capture policies are available to help further tune Query Store captures. Custom capture policies can be used to be more selective about which queries, and query details are captured. For example, an administrator may choose to capture only the most expensive queries, repeated queries, or the queries that have a high level of compute overhead. [Custom capture policies](../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-set-options.md#query_capture_policy_option_list--) can help Query Store capture the most important queries in your workload. Except for the STALE_CAPTURE_POLICY_THRESHOLD option, these options define the OR conditions that need to happen for queries to be captured in the defined Stale Capture Policy Threshold value. For example, these are the default values in the `QUERY_CAPTURE_MODE = AUTO`:

```sql
...
QUERY_CAPTURE_MODE = CUSTOM,
QUERY_CAPTURE_POLICY = (
STALE_CAPTURE_POLICY_THRESHOLD = 24 HOURS,
EXECUTION_COUNT = 30,
TOTAL_COMPILE_CPU_TIME_MS = 1000,
TOTAL_EXECUTION_CPU_TIME_MS = 100
)
...
```

### SQL Server service is set to Automatic (Delayed Start) start mode

Starting with [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)], when you set the **Start Mode** for a [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service to *Automatic* in Configuration Manager, the service will start in *Automatic (Delayed Start)* mode instead, even though the **Start Mode** shows as *Automatic*.
