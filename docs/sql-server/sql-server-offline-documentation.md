# Install SQL Server documentation to view offline in SSMS

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This article describes how to download and view offline SQL Server content in [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md). Offline content enables you to access the documentation without an internet connection (although an internet connection is initially required to download it).

## Overview

Offline documentation is available for versions of SQL Server 2012 and later. Although you can view content for [previous versions online](/previous-versions/sql/), an offline option provides a convenient way to access the older content.

- [SQL Server 2016 and later](#sql-server-2016-and-later-offline-content)
- [SQL Server 2014](#sql-server-2014-offline-content)
- [SQL Server 2012](#sql-server-2012-offline-content)

If your system doesn't have internet access and you want to install the offline content, first downlad the content on a system that has internet, and then move the package over to the offline system, using SSMS to locate the installation file path and load the files. 

## SQL Server 2016 and later offline content

The following steps explain how to load offline content for SQL Server 2016 and later by using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) that has access to the internet. 

1. In SSMS, select **Add and Remove Help Content** on the Help menu.

   ![Add and Remove Help Content](../sql-server/media/sql-server-offline-documentation/add-remove-content.png)

   The Help Viewer opens to the Manage Content tab.

2. To find the latest help content for SQL Server 2016 and later, under the **Manage Content** tab choose **Online** under the Installation source and then type in *sql server* in the search bar.

   ![SQL Server books search](../sql-server/media/sql-server-offline-documentation/sql-online-search.png)

   > [!Note]
   > The Local store path on the Manage Content tab shows where on the local computer the content is installed. To change the location, select **Move**, enter a different folder path in the **To** field, and then select **OK**. If the help installation fails after changing the Local store path, close and reopen Help Viewer. Ensure the new location appears in the Local store path and then try the installation again.

3. To install the latest help content for SQL Server 2016 and later, select **Add** next to each content package (book) that you want to install and then select **Update** in the lower right.

   ![SQL Server online books add and update](../sql-server/media/sql-server-offline-documentation/sql-add-update.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the Help Viewer freezes (hangs) while adding content, change the Cache LastRefreshed="\<mm/dd/yyyy> 00:00:00" line in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\HelpViewer2.x\HlpViewer_SSMSx_en-US.settings or HlpViewer_VisualStudiox_en-US.settings file to some date in the future. For more information about this issue, see [Visual Studio Help Viewer freezes](/visualstudio/welcome-to-visual-studio).

4. You can verify that the SQL Server 2016 and later content loaded by searching under the left content pane for *sql server 2016*.

5. (Optional) To move the content to an offline system, go to the **Local store path** (mentioned in step 2) where the files were installed.  Copy the ContentStore and IndexStore folders to **new** folder in another location.  After copying, zip up the folders and their contents, then copy them to the offline system.

6. On the offline system, open SSMS, select **Add and Remove Help Content** on the Help menu.  Go to the **Manage Content** tab and note the location for the Local store path.  Close SSMS.

7. Extract the contents of the zip file.  Copy the contents of the ContentStore folder into the ContentStore folder within the Local store path.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The installedBooks.*.xml file should be larger than 1KB.  If there are two files with the same names, rename the smaller file to .old (change the file extension).

8. Copy the contents of the IndexStore folder into the IndexStore folder within the local store path.

9. Open SSMS, select **Add and Remove Help Content** on the Help menu to view the documentation.
