# SQL Server 2022 release notes

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver2022](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2022.md)]

This article describes requirements, limitations and known issues for [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)].

## Hardware and software requirements

For hardware and software requirements, see [SQL Server 2022: Hardware and software requirements](install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server-2022.md).

## Known issues

This section identifies known issues you may experience with this product. You may also review the Known Issues section of the [Cumulative Update](/troubleshoot/sql/releases/sqlserver-2022/build-versions) articles.

### SQL Setup

#### Help

When you run `setup /HELP`, the information returned doesn't include the new `/AZUREEXTENSION` feature. Complete information for Setup is available at [Install SQL Server on Windows from the command prompt](../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt.md).

#### Localized language interface

In certain localized languages, the Azure Extension configuration screen controls may be partially overwritten or missing. To resolve this issue, expand or maximize the Setup window from the default window sizing.

#### Software Assurance installation parameter

A new Setup command line installation parameter `/PRODUCTCOVEREDBYSA` indicates if the provided product key (`/PID=`) license is covered under a Software Assurance or SQL Server Subscription contract, or just a SQL Server license.

[Install SQL Server on Windows from the command prompt](../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt.md) describes this parameter.

#### Deprecated feature parameters

The following features aren't available in Setup in [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)]. If specified in command line installations or scripts, these previously supported parameters may fail.

:::row:::
    :::column:::
     - `/PolyBaseJava`
     - `/SQL_INST_MR`
     - `/SQL_INST_JAVA`
     - `/SQL_INST_MPY`
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
     - `/SQLJAVADIR`
     - `/SQL_SHARED_MPY`
     - `/SNAC_SDK`
     - `/SQL_SHARED_MR`
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
     - `/SDK`
     - `/DREPLAY_CTLR`
     - `/TOOLS`
     - `/DREPLAY_CLT`
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

#### Restart requirement

When you install an initial [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] instance on a Windows Server 2022 machine, if the computer doesn't have `VCRuntime140` version 14.29.30139 or a later version installed, Setup will require a restart.

Windows Server 2022 was released with VCRuntime version 14.28.29914.

### Query Store for secondary replicas

[Query Store for secondary replicas](../relational-databases/performance/query-store-for-secondary-replicas.md) is available for preview. It isn't available for use in production environments.

### Known issues with Parameter Sensitive Plan optimization

If you are using the [Parameter Sensitive Plan optimization](../relational-databases/performance/parameter-sensitive-plan-optimization.md) feature, please review the guidance and mitigation for known issues that  can results in exceptions during query store cleanup process. More information and details is available at [Access violation exception occurs in Query Store in SQL Server 2022 under certain conditions](../relational-databases/performance/parameter-sensitive-plan-optimization.md#access-violation-exception-occurs-in-query-store-in-sql-server-2022-under-certain-conditions).

### RPC calls fail with `Encrypt=Strict`

An issue in the TDS 8.0 protocol implementation may cause RPC calls to fail if the `Encrypt` option is set to `Strict` in your connection string, for example when running the `sp_who` system stored procedure.

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] RTM

### Availability group replica manager

**Error 35221** states that the Always On availability groups replica manager is disabled. This error may be encountered when attempting to add a file to a FILESTREAM filegroup or a memory-optimized filegroup, or when attempting to add additional transaction log files to a database.

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] RTM

The fix for this issue is released in [Cumulative Update 1](/troubleshoot/sql/releases/sqlserver-2022/cumulativeupdate1#1993393) for [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)].

To work around this issue, you can use Trace Flag 12324 as either as startup trace flag, or at the session level (using `DBCC TRACEON`).

### SQL Server Agent errors when using contained Availability Group

You might encounter error messages in SQL Server Agent or Database Mail when using contained Availability Group feature of [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)].

Review the article [Errors occur after you apply a cumulative update to an instance of SQL Server that has a contained availability group](/troubleshoot/sql/releases/sqlserver-2022/errors-apply-cu-contained-availability-group) for details on addressing the issue.

### SQL Server services are set to Automatic (Delayed Start) start mode

In [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)], setting the **Start Mode** for a [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service to *Automatic* in Configuration Manager, will configure that service to start in *Automatic (Delayed Start)* mode instead, even though the **Start Mode** shows as *Automatic*.

### MSOLEDBSQL19 and linked servers

Currently, MSOLEDBSQL19 prevents the creation of linked servers without encryption and a trusted certificate (a self-signed certificate is insufficient). If linked servers are required, use the existing supported version of MSOLEDBSQL.

### Transaction log growth for databases with In-Memory OLTP

You may notice excessive growth in the transaction log size for databases with the [In-Memory OLTP](../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/overview-and-usage-scenarios.md) feature enabled. This might be coupled with `XTP_CHECKPOINT` as `log_reuse_wait_desc` in [sys.databases](../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-databases-transact-sql.md).

For more information, review [Transaction log file grows for databases with In-Memory OLTP in SQL Server 2022](/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/general/transaction-log-file-grows-databases-in-memory-oltp).
