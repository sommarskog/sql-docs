# Remove a failover cluster instance (Setup)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Use this procedure to uninstall an Always On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instance.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To update or remove a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster, you must be a local administrator with permission to login as a service on all nodes of the Windows Server failover cluster.  
  
 **Before you begin**  
  
 Consider the following important points before you uninstall a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instance:  
  
-   If [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client is uninstalled by accident, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resources will fail to start. To reinstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client, run the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup program to install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] prerequisites.  
  
-   If you uninstall a failover cluster that has more than one SQL IP cluster resource, you must remove the additional SQL IP resources using Failover Cluster Manager or PowerShell.

### To uninstall a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instance
  
1.  To uninstall a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster, use the Remove Node functionality provided by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup to remove each node individually. For more information, see [Add or Remove Nodes in an Always On Failover Cluster &#40;Setup&#41;](../../../sql-server/failover-clusters/install/add-or-remove-nodes-in-a-sql-server-failover-cluster-setup.md).
