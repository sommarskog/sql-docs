This article describes limitations and known issues for the [!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/sssql19-md.md)]. For related information, see:

> [What's New in [!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/sssql19-md.md)]](../sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-ver15.md)

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-servicing-updates-version-15](../includes/sql-server-servicing-updates-version-15.md)]

## SQL Server installation may fail if SSMS 18.x is installed

- **Issue and customer impact**: [!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] installation fails when the following installations happen in this order:
  1. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) version 18.0, 18.1, 18.2, or 18.3 is installed on the server.
  1. [!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] installation is attempted from removable media. For example, the installation media is a DVD.

- **Workaround**:
  1. Uninstall any version of SSMS older than SSMS 18.3.1.
  1. Install a newer version of SSMS (18.3.1 or later). For the latest version, see [Download SSMS](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).
  1. Install [!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] normally.

- **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/sssql19-md.md)]

## UTF-8 collations

- **Issue and customer impact**: UTF-8 enabled collations cannot be used with the following features:
  - [In-Memory OLTP tables](../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/introduction-to-memory-optimized-tables.md)
  - [Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves](../relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves.md) (When not using Secure Enclaves, [Always Encrypted](../relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine.md) can use UTF-8)

  > [!WARNING]
  > Creating a [bacpac](../relational-databases/data-tier-applications/data-tier-applications.md#bacpac) of a database containing table columns defined as [CHAR or VARCHAR](../t-sql/data-types/char-and-varchar-transact-sql.md) that use more than 4000 bytes will fail.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > There is currently no UI support to choose UTF-8 enabled collations in Azure Data Studio or SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). The latest [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] (SSMS) version 18 supports choice of UTF-8 enabled collations in the UI.

- **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] RTM

## Master Data Service notification email contains broken link

- **Issue and customer impact**: The notification email from Master Data Services (MDS) contains a broken link. The link navigates to a page that returns an error like the following message:

   `The view 'Index' or its master was not found or no view engine supports the searched locations.`

- **Workaround**: Open the MDS portal and go to the resource manually.

- **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] RTM
