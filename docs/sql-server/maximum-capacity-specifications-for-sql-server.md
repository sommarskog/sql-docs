# Maximum capacity specifications for SQL Server

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This article shows maximum sizes and numbers of various objects defined in [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and later. If you want to view edition limits, see [Compute capacity limits by edition of SQL Server](compute-capacity-limits-by-edition-of-sql-server.md).

For [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../includes/ssSQL14-md.md)], see [Maximum capacity specifications for SQL Server 2014](/previous-versions/sql/2014/sql-server/maximum-capacity-specifications-for-sql-server).

## [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] objects

Maximum values of various objects defined in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] databases, or referenced in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements.

|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] object|Maximum&nbsp;values&nbsp;for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (64-bit)|Additional Information|
|---|---|---|
|Batch size|65,536 * (network packet size)|Network packet size is the size of the tabular data stream (TDS) packets used to communicate between the relational [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] and applications. The default packet size is 4 KB. Network packet size controls this configuration option.|
|Byte length of a string containing [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements (batch size)|65,536 * (network packet size)|Network packet size is the size of the tabular data stream (TDS) packets used to communicate between the relational [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] and applications. The default packet size is 4 KB, and is controlled by the network packet size configuration option.|
|Bytes per short string column|8,000||
|Bytes per `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`|8,060||
|Bytes per index key|900 bytes for a clustered index. 1,700 bytes for a nonclustered index. For [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../includes/ssSQL14-md.md)] and earlier, all versions supported 900 bytes for all index types.|The maximum number of bytes in a clustered index key can't exceed 900. For a nonclustered index key, the maximum is 1,700 bytes.<br /><br />You can define a key using variable-length columns whose maximum sizes add up to more than the limit. However, the combined sizes of the data in those columns can never exceed the limit.<br /><br />In a nonclustered index, you can include extra non-key columns, and they don't count against the size limit of the key. The non-key columns might help some queries perform better.|
|Bytes per index key for memory-optimized tables|2,500 bytes for a nonclustered index. No limit for a hash index, as long as all index keys fit in-row.|On a memory-optimized table, a nonclustered index can't have key columns whose maximum declared sizes exceed 2,500 bytes. It doesn't matter if the actual data in the key columns would be shorter than the maximum declared sizes.<br /><br />For a hash index key, there's no hard limit on size.<br /><br />For indexes on memory-optimized tables, there's no concept of included columns, since all indexes inherently cover all columns.<br /><br />For a memory-optimized table, even though the row size is 8,060 bytes, some variable-length columns can be physically stored outside those 8,060 bytes. However, the maximum declared sizes of all key columns for all indexes on a table, plus any additional fixed-length columns in the table, must fit in the 8,060 bytes.|
|Bytes per foreign key|900||
|Bytes per primary key|900||
|Bytes per row|8,060|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports row-overflow storage, which enables variable length columns to be pushed off-row. Only a 24-byte root is stored in the main record for variable length columns pushed out of row. For more information, see [Large Row Support](../relational-databases/pages-and-extents-architecture-guide.md#large-row-support).|
|Bytes per row in memory-optimized tables|8,060|Memory-optimized tables on [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and later support off-row storage. Variable length columns are pushed off-row if the maximum sizes for all the columns in the table exceeds 8,060 bytes; this action is a compile-time decision. Only an 8-byte reference is stored in-row for columns stored off-row. For more information, see [Table and Row Size in Memory-Optimized Tables](../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/table-and-row-size-in-memory-optimized-tables.md).|
|Bytes in source text of a stored procedure|Lesser of batch size or 250 MB||

|Characters per `ntext` or `nvarchar(max)` column|2^30-1||
|Clustered indexes per table|1||
|Columns in `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`|Limited only by number of bytes||
|Columns or expressions in a `GROUP BY WITH CUBE` or `GROUP BY WITH ROLLUP` statement|10||
|Columns per index key|32|If the table contains one or more XML indexes, the clustering key of the user table is limited to 31 columns because the XML column is added to the clustering key of the primary XML index. You can include non-key columns in a nonclustered index, to avoid the limitation of a maximum of 32 key columns. For more information, see [Create Indexes with Included Columns](../relational-databases/indexes/create-indexes-with-included-columns.md).|
|Columns per foreign key or primary key|32||
|Columns per `INSERT` statement|4,096||

|Foreign key table references per table|Outgoing = 253.<br/>Incoming = 10,000.|For restrictions, see [Create Foreign Key Relationships](../relational-databases/tables/create-foreign-key-relationships.md).|
|Identifier length (in characters)|128||
|Instances per computer|50 instances on a stand-alone server.<br /><br />25 failover cluster instances when using a shared cluster drive as storage.<br/><br/>50 failover cluster instances with SMB file shares as the storage option.||
|Indexes per memory-optimized table|999 starting [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../includes/ssSQL17-md.md)] and in [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)].<br/><br/>8 in [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../includes/ssSQL14-md.md)].||
