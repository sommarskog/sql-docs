        Windows Server 2016 Core
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column:::
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

For more information on installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  on Server Core, see [Install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  on Server Core](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-on-server-core.md). 

> [!NOTE]  
> Installing SQL Server on a Windows OS on which case sensitivity is enabled isn't supported. For more information review [SQL Server isn't supported on a Windows operating system on which case sensitivity is enabled](/troubleshoot/sql/install/sql-server-not-supported-in-windows-os-where-case-sensitivity-enabled)

##  <a name="CrossLanguageSupport"></a> Cross-language support  
 For more information about cross-language support and considerations for installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in localized languages, see [Local Language Versions in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]](../../sql-server/install/local-language-versions-in-sql-server.md).  
  
##  <a name="HardDiskSpace"></a>  Disk space requirements  
 During installation of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], Windows Installer creates temporary files on the system drive. Before you run Setup to install or upgrade [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], verify that you have at least 6.0 GB of available disk space on the system drive for these files. This requirement applies even if you install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components to a non-default drive.  
  
 Actual hard disk space requirements depend on your system configuration and the features that you decide to install. The following table provides disk space requirements for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components.  
  
|**Feature**|**Disk space requirement**|  
|-----------------|--------------------------------|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] and data files, Replication, Full-Text Search, and Data Quality Services|1480 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] (as above) with R Services (In-Database)|2744 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] (as above) with PolyBase Query Service for External Data|4194 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] and data files|698 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]|967 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[rsql_platform](../../includes/rsql-platform-md.md)] (Standalone)|280 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] - SharePoint|1203 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Add-in for SharePoint Products|325 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../../includes/ssdqsclient-md.md)]|121 MB|  
|Client Tools Connectivity|328 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]|306 MB|  
|Client Components (other than [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online components and Integration Services tools)|445 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]|280 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online Components to view and manage help content*|27 MB|  
|All Features|8030 MB|  
  
 *The disk space requirement for downloaded Books Online content is 200 MB.  
  
##  <a name="StorageTypes"></a> Storage types for data files  
 The supported storage types for data files are:  
  
- Local Disk 
    - [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] currently supports disk drives that have standard native sector sizes of 512 bytes and 4 KB.  Hard disks with sector sizes larger than 4 KB may cause errors when attempting to store [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data files on them.  See [Hard disk drive sector-size support boundaries in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/926930) for more information on hard disk sector-size support in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see [Troubleshoot errors related to system disk sector size greater than 4 KB](/troubleshoot/sql/admin/troubleshoot-os-4kb-disk-sector-size).
    - [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster installation supports Local Disk only for installing the tempdb files. Ensure that the path specified for the tempdb data and log files is valid on all the cluster nodes. During failover, if the tempdb directories are not available on the failover target node, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resource will fail to come online.
- Shared Storage  
- [Storage Spaces Direct \(S2D\)](/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview)  
- SMB File Share  
    - SMB storage isn't supported for [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] data files for either standalone or clustered installations. Use direct attached storage, a storage area network, or S2D instead. 
    - SMB storage can be hosted by a Windows File Server or a third-party SMB storage device. If Windows File Server is used, the Windows File Server version should be 2008 or later. For more information about installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using SMB file share as a storage option, see [Install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  with SMB Fileshare as a Storage Option](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-with-smb-fileshare-as-a-storage-option.md).  
  
  
  
##  <a name="DC_support"></a> Installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a domain controller  
 For security reasons, don't install [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a domain controller. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup doesn't block installation on a computer that is a domain controller, but the following limitations apply:  
  
- You can't run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services on a domain controller under a local service account.    
- After [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed on a computer, you can't change the computer from a domain member to a domain controller. You must uninstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] before you change the host computer to a domain controller.    
- After [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed on a computer, you can't change the computer from a domain controller to a domain member. You must uninstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] before you change the host computer to a domain member.   
- [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instances are not supported where cluster nodes are domain controllers.   
- [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] isn't supported on a read-only domain controller. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup can't create security groups or provision [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service accounts on a read-only domain controller. In this scenario, Setup will fail. 
- A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instance isn't supported in an environment where only a read-only domain controller is accessible. 
  
## Installation media

You can get relevant installation media from the following locations: 
  
- [[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  evaluation center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2019)
- [Most recent cumulative updates](/troubleshoot/sql/releases/download-and-install-latest-updates?bc=%2fsql%2fbreadcrumb%2ftoc.json&toc=%2fsql%2ftoc.json)

Alternatively, you can create an [Azure virtual machine already running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]](/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/sql-vm-create-portal-quickstart) though [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  on a virtual machine will be slower than running natively because of the overhead of virtualization.


## Next steps

Once you've reviewed the hardware and software requirements for installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can start to [Plan a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  Installation](../../sql-server/install/planning-a-sql-server-installation.md) or review the [Security considerations for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]](../../sql-server/install/security-considerations-for-a-sql-server-installation.md).
