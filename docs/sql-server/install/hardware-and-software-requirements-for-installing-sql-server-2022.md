For more information on installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  on Server Core, see [Install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  on Server Core](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-on-server-core.md).

## <a id="CrossLanguageSupport"></a> Cross-language support

For more information about cross-language support and considerations for installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in localized languages, see [Local Language Versions in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]](../../sql-server/install/local-language-versions-in-sql-server.md).

## <a id="HardDiskSpace"></a> Disk space requirements

During installation of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], Windows Installer creates temporary files on the system drive. Before you run Setup to install or upgrade [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], verify that you have at least 6.0 GB of available disk space on the system drive for these files. This requirement applies even if you install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components to a non-default drive.

Actual hard disk space requirements depend on your system configuration and the features that you decide to install. The following table provides disk space requirements for [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components.

|**Feature**|**Disk space requirement**|
|-----------------|---:|
|[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] and data files, Replication, Full-Text Search, and Data Quality Services|1,480 MB|
|[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] (as above) with R Services (In-Database)|2,744 MB|
|[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] (as above) with PolyBase Query Service for External Data|4,194 MB|
|[!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] and data files|698 MB|
|[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]|967 MB|
|[!INCLUDE[rsql_platform](../../includes/rsql-platform-md.md)] (Standalone)|280 MB|
|[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] - SharePoint|1,203 MB|
|[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Add-in for SharePoint Products|325 MB|
|[!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../../includes/ssdqsclient-md.md)]|121 MB|
|Client Tools Connectivity|328 MB|
|[!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]|306 MB|
|Client Components (other than [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online components and Integration Services tools)|445 MB|
|[!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]|280 MB|
|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online Components to view and manage help content<sup>1</sup>|27 MB|
|All features|8,030 MB|

<sup>1</sup> The disk space requirement for downloaded Books Online content is 200 MB.

## <a id="StorageTypes"></a> Storage types for data files

The supported storage types for data files are:

- Local Disk
  - [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] currently supports disk drives that have standard native sector sizes of 512 bytes and 4 KB.  Hard disks with sector sizes larger than 4 KB may cause errors when attempting to store [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data files on them.  See [Hard disk drive sector-size support boundaries in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/926930) for more information on hard disk sector-size support in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see [Troubleshoot errors related to system disk sector size greater than 4 KB](/troubleshoot/sql/admin/troubleshoot-os-4kb-disk-sector-size).
  - [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster installation supports Local Disk only for installing the `tempdb` files. Ensure that the path specified for the `tempdb` data and log files is valid on all the cluster nodes. During failover, if the `tempdb` directories are not available on the failover target node, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resource will fail to come online.
- Shared Storage
- [Storage Spaces Direct \(S2D\)](/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview)
- SMB File Share
  - SMB storage is not supported for [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] data files for either standalone or clustered installations. Use direct attached storage, a storage area network, or S2D instead.
  - SMB storage can be hosted by a Windows File Server or a third-party SMB storage device. If Windows File Server is used, the Windows File Server version should be 2008 or later. For more information about installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using SMB file share as a storage option, see [Install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  with SMB Fileshare as a Storage Option](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-with-smb-fileshare-as-a-storage-option.md).

## <a id="DC_support"></a> Install SQL Server on a domain controller

For security reasons, we recommend that you do not install [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a domain controller. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup will not block installation on a computer that is a domain controller, but the following limitations apply:

- You cannot run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services on a domain controller under a local service account.
- After [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed on a computer, you cannot change the computer from a domain member to a domain controller. You must uninstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] before you change the host computer to a domain controller.
- After [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed on a computer, you cannot change the computer from a domain controller to a domain member. You must uninstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] before you change the host computer to a domain member.
- [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instances are not supported where cluster nodes are domain controllers.
- [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is not supported on a read-only domain controller. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup cannot create security groups or provision [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service accounts on a read-only domain controller. In this scenario, Setup will fail.
- A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instance is not supported in an environment where only a read-only domain controller is accessible.

## Installation media

You can get relevant installation media from the following locations:

- [SQL Server evaluation center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2022)
- [Most recent cumulative updates](/troubleshoot/sql/releases/download-and-install-latest-updates?bc=%2fsql%2fbreadcrumb%2ftoc.json&toc=%2fsql%2ftoc.json)

Alternatively, you can create an [Azure virtual machine already running SQL Server](/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/sql-vm-create-portal-quickstart) though [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  on a virtual machine will be slower than running natively because of the overhead of virtualization.
