# Uninstall an existing instance of SQL Server (Setup)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]

This article describes how to uninstall a stand-alone instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. By following the steps in this article, you also prepare the system so that you can reinstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

To uninstall a Cumulative Update, see [Uninstall a Cumulative Update from SQL Server](uninstall-a-cumulative-update-from-sql-server.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> To uninstall a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster, use the Remove Node functionality provided by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup to remove each node individually. For more information, see [Add or Remove Nodes in a SQL Server Failover Cluster (Setup)](../../sql-server/failover-clusters/install/add-or-remove-nodes-in-a-sql-server-failover-cluster-setup.md)

## Considerations

- To uninstall SQL Server, you must be a local administrator with permissions to log on as a service.
- If your computer has the *minimum* required amount of physical memory, increase the size of the page file to two times the amount of physical memory. Insufficient virtual memory can result in an incomplete removal of SQL Server.
- On a system with multiple instances of SQL Server, the SQL Server browser service is uninstalled only once the last instance of SQL Server is removed. The SQL Server Browser service can be removed manually from **Programs and Features** in the **Control Panel**.
- Uninstalling [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] deletes `tempdb` data files that were added during the install process. Files with tempdb_mssql_*.ndf name pattern are deleted if they exist in the system database directory.

## Prepare

1. **Back up your data.** Either create [full backups](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/create-a-full-database-backup-sql-server.md) of all databases, including system databases, or manually copy the .mdf and .ldf files to a separate location. The `master` database contains all system level information for the server, such as logins, and schemas. The `msdb` database contains job information such as SQL Server agent jobs, backup history, and maintenance plans. For more information about system databases, see [System databases](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/back-up-and-restore-of-system-databases-sql-server.md).

   The files that you must save include the following database files <sup>1</sup>:

   - `master.mdf`
   - `mastlog.ldf`
   - `msdbdata.mdf`
   - `msdblog.ldf`
   - `model.mdf`
   - `modellog.ldf`
   - `mssqlsystemresource.mdf`
   - `mssqlsystemresource.ldf`
   - `ReportServer[$InstanceName]` data and log files <sup>2</sup> 
   - `ReportServer[$InstanceName]TempDB` data and log files <sup>2</sup> 

   <sup>1</sup> You can't back up the `tempdb` system database.

   <sup>2</sup> The *ReportServer* databases are included with SQL Server Reporting Services.

1. **Stop all [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services.** We recommend that you stop all [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services before you uninstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components. Active connections can prevent successful uninstallation.

1. **Use an account that has the appropriate permissions.** Sign in to the server by using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service account or by using an account that has equivalent permissions. For example, you can log on to the server by using an account that is a member of the local Administrators group.

## Uninstall

## In the event of failure

If the removal process fails, review the [SQL Server Setup log files](../../database-engine/install-windows/view-and-read-sql-server-setup-log-files.md) to determine the root cause.
