Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server releases for general availability support

### Breaking changes

This release introduces a SQL Server extension that continuously monitors for changes of the SQL Server configuration and automatically updates the corresponding Arc-enabled SQL Server resources. The extension is installed as part of the SQL Server instance registration process. To upgrade your existing Arc-enabled SQL Server resources to an agent-based configuration, use any of the methods described in [Connect your SQL Server to Azure Arc](connect.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you installed a version of SQL Server extension during the preview, make sure it is updated to version 1.1.1668.43 or later. An extension can be updated using the *Extension* pane of the specific connected server resource.

The introduction of SQL Server extension requires that the user accounts have more privileges in order to connect a  SQL Server instance to Azure Arc. For details, see [prerequisites](prerequisites.md).

> [!NOTE]
> In this release, the SQL Server extension is only available for  Windows. A Linux version of the extension will be announced separately.

### Other changes

This release includes a new Azure policy *Configure Arc-enabled machines running SQL Server to have SQL Server extension installed*. It enables automatic registration of all SQL Server instances after their hosting server is connected to Azure Arc. For details of using this policy, see [At scale registration from Azure](connect-at-scale-policy.md#connect-at-scale-using-azure-policy).

## April 2021

### Breaking change

No breaking changes

### Other changes

A new property *LicenseType* has been added to the **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resource type. It indicates if your SQL Server instance requires a license. The property can have one of the following values:

| **Value** | **Description** |
|:--|:--|
|Paid|Indicates that the instance uses Enterprise, Standard or Web edition of SQL Server|
|Free|Indicates that the instance uses Express or Developer edition of SQL Server|
|HADR|Indicates that the instance is a replica in an availability group. If it's covered by Software Assurance, it may not require a license. For more information, see [SQL Server Commercial Licensing Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/SQLServer/EAEAS).

> [!NOTE]
> For the existing **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resources, this property will show a *Null* value. It will be automatically updated with the correct value after Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server becomes generally available.

## December 2020

### Breaking change

This release introduces an updated [resource provider](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers) called `Microsoft.AzureArcData`. Before you can continue using Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server, you need to register this resource provider. See the resource provider registration instructions in the [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md) section.

If you have existing SQL Server - Azure Arc resources, use these steps to migrate them to Microsoft.AzureArcData namespace.

1. Launch the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/). For details, [read more about PowerShell in Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart-powershell).

2. Upload the script to the shell using the following command:

    ```console
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/master/samples/manage/azure-arc-enabled-sql-server/migrate-to-azure-arc-data.ps1 -o migrate-to-azure-arc-data.ps1
    ```

3. Run the script.

    ```console
   ./migrate-to-azure-arc-data.ps1
    ```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - To paste the commands into the shell, use `Ctrl-Shift-V` on Windows or `Cmd-v` on MacOS.
> - The `curl` command will copy the script directly to the home folder associated with your Cloud Shell session.
> - The script will prompt for the resource group name and print a message when migration is completed.

### Other changes

- The *TCPPorts* property in the **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resource type has been renamed to *TCPStaticPorts*
- The permissions required aren't as broad as they used to be. See the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) section for details.

### Known issues

- The *CreateTime* property won't be added to any newly created resources in the AzureArcData namespace, including the **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resources.

## October 2020

The October update includes the following improvements:

- The register Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server pane now includes the **Tags** tab. The tags are included in the registration script and are reflected in the **SQL Server - Azure Arc** resource(s). For details, see [Connect your SQL Server to Azure Arc](connect.md).
- The **Environment Health** entry now supports activation of **SQL Assessment** from the Portal by deploying a *CustomScriptExtension*. For details, see [Configure SQL Assessment](assess.md#enable-best-practices-assessment).

### Known issues

The following issues apply to the October release:

- Connecting SQL Server instances to Azure Arc requires an account with a broad set of permissions. For details, see [prerequisites](prerequisites.md).
