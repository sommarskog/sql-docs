> The Microsoft SQL Server PolyBase scale-out groups will be retired. Scale-out group functionality will be removed from the product in [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](sssql22-md.md)]. PolyBase data virtualization will continue to be fully supported as a scale-up feature in SQL Server. For more information, see [Big data options on the Microsoft SQL Server platform](../big-data-cluster/big-data-options.md).
