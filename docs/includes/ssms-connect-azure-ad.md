> To continue utilizing Azure Active Directory authentication with MFA, you need [SSMS 18.6 or later](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).
>
> Connectivity to Azure Analysis Services through Azure Active Directory with MFA requires [SSMS 18.5.1 or later](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).
