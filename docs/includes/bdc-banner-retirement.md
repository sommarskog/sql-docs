Support for SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters will end on February 28, 2025.  <!-- see also docs\big-data-cluster\index.yml --> All existing users of SQL Server 2019 with Software Assurance will be fully supported on the platform and the software will continue to be maintained through SQL Server cumulative updates until that time. For more information, see [the announcement blog post](https://aka.ms/sqlserver_bigdataclusters) and [Big data options on the Microsoft SQL Server platform](../big-data-cluster/big-data-options.md).
