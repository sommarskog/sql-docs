## Specify application intent

You can specify the keyword `ApplicationIntent` in your connection string. The assignable values are `ReadWrite` (the default) or `ReadOnly`.

When you set `ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly`, the client requests a read workload when connecting. The server enforces the intent at connection time, and during a `USE` database statement.

The `ApplicationIntent` keyword doesn't work with legacy read-only databases.  

### Targets of ReadOnly

When a connection chooses `ReadOnly`, the connection is assigned to any of the following special configurations that might exist for the database:

- [Always On](../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/overview-of-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server.md). A database can allow or disallow read workloads on the targeted availability group database. This choice is controlled by using the `ALLOW_CONNECTIONS` clause of the `PRIMARY_ROLE` and `SECONDARY_ROLE` Transact-SQL statements.

- [Geo-replication](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-geo-replication-overview)

- [Read scale-out](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-read-scale-out)

If none of those special targets are available, the regular database is read from.

The `ApplicationIntent` keyword enables *read-only routing*.

## Read-only routing

Read-only routing is a feature that can ensure the availability of a read-only replica of a database. To enable read-only routing, all of the following apply:

- You must connect to an Always On availability group listener.

- The `ApplicationIntent` connection string keyword must be set to `ReadOnly`.

- The database administrator must configure the availability group to enable read-only routing.

Multiple connections that each use read-only routing might not all connect to the same read-only replica. Changes in database synchronization or changes in the server's routing configuration can result in client connections to different read-only replicas.

You can ensure that all read-only requests connect to the same read-only replica by *not* passing an availability group listener to the `Server` connection string keyword. Instead, specify the name of the read-only instance.

Read-only routing might take longer than connecting to the primary. This is because read-only routing first connects to the primary, and then looks for the best available readable secondary. Due to these multiple steps, you should increase your `login` timeout to at least 30 seconds.
