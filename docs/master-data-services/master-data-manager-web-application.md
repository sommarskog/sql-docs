# Master Data Manager Web Application

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  The [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] web application is used primarily by administrators to perform administrative tasks. For example, only administrators can create models, business rules, or versions of data. For more information about administrators, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] works only in Internet Explorer (IE) 9 or later. IE 8  and earlier versions, Microsoft Edge and Chrome are not supported.

 The Explorer functional area of the web application is the only area not used by administrators. Explorer is for those who update master data on a frequent basis. These users have permission to the data required to do their jobs.
