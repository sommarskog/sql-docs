# Web Application Requirements (Master Data Services)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only - ASDBMI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] is a web application hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS). [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] works only in Internet Explorer (IE) 9 or later. IE 8  and earlier versions, Microsoft Edge and Chrome are not supported.  

**For instructions on how to install and configure IIS**, see [Installing and Configuring IIS](../../master-data-services/master-data-services-installation-and-configuration.md#InstallIIS).
  
 Use [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../../includes/ssmdscfgmgr-md.md)] to create and configure the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] web application. [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../../includes/ssmdscfgmgr-md.md)] configures IIS on the local computer, so it is best for initial web configuration tasks. For example, configure a [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] environment with a single [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] web application, or configure the first web application in a scale-out deployment of [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]. Use IIS tools to perform more complex tasks, such as configuring multiple web servers in a scale-out deployment.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Any computer on which you install components of [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] must be licensed. For more information, refer to the End User License Agreement (EULA).  
  
## Requirements  
  
### Operating System  
 Before you install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], review the following requirements:    
    
-   [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2016 and 2017](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md)    
-   [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2019](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server-2019.md)    
  
### Microsoft Silverlight  
 To work in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] web application, Silverlight 5 must be installed on the client computer. If you do not have the required version of Silverlight, you will be prompted to install it when you navigate to an area of the web application that requires it. You can install Silverlight 5 from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243096).  
  
### Role and Role Services  
 On Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2, you can use **Server Manager**, which is available in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), to install the **Web Server (IIS)** role, and required role services.  
 
 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>**Dynamic Content Compression** is enabled by default. This significantly reduces the size of the xml response and saves the network I/O, though CPU usage is increased.  For more information, see **[CTP 2.0] Improved Performance** in [What's New in Master Data Services &#40;MDS&#41;](../../master-data-services/what-s-new-in-master-data-services-mds.md).

 For more information about PowerShell command, see [Install-WindowsFeature](/powershell/module/servermanager/install-windowsfeature).  
  
### Accounts and Permissions  
  
|Type|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|Windows account|You must log on to the web server computer with a Windows account that has permission to configure Windows roles, role services, and features, and to create and manage application pools, web sites, and web applications in IIS on the local computer.|  
|Service account|When you create the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] web application in [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../../includes/ssmdscfgmgr-md.md)], you must specify an identity for the application pool that the application runs in. This account can be different from the service account that was specified when the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database was created.<br /><br /> This identity must be a domain user account, and it is added to the mds_exec database role in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database for database access. For more information, see [Database Logins, Users, and Roles](../../master-data-services/database-logins-users-and-roles-master-data-services.md). This account is also added to a [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] Windows group, **MDS_ServiceAccounts**, which is granted permission to the temporary compilation directory, **MDSTempDir**, in the file system. For more information, see [Folder and File Permissions &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/folder-and-file-permissions-master-data-services.md).|
