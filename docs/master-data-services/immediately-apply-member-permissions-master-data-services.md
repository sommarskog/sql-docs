# Immediately apply member permissions (Master Data Services)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], instead of waiting for member security to be applied at regular intervals, you can apply member permissions immediately.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to execute the mdm.udpSecurityMemberProcessRebuildModel stored procedure in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database. For more information, see [Database Object Security &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/database-object-security-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To immediately apply hierarchy member permissions  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] instance for your [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database.  
  
2.  Create a new query.  
  
3.  Type the following text, replacing *database* with the name of your database and *Model_Name* with the name of the model.  
  
    ```  
    USE [database];  
    GO  
  
    DECLARE @Model_ID INT;  
    SELECT @Model_ID = ID FROM mdm.tblModel WHERE [Name] = N'Model_Name';  
    EXEC [mdm].[udpSecurityMemberProcessRebuildModel] @Model_ID=@Model_ID, @ProcessNow=1;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
4.  Run the query.
