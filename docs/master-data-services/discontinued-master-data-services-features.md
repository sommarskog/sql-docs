# Discontinued Master Data Services Features

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  This topic describes [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] features that are no longer available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Discontinued Features  
 The [!INCLUDE[sql2008r2](../includes/sql2008r2-md.md)] staging process is removed in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
