# Merge Conflicts (Master Data Services)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], if data that you are attempting to publish has been changed by another user, the publish will fail with a conflict error. To resolve this error, you can perform merge conflicts and republish the changes.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Explorer** functional area.  
  
-   You must have a minimum of Update permission to the leaf model object for the entity you are updating.  
  
### To merge conflicts  
  
1.  In the **Explorer** page, update the member attribute.  
  
2.  If the same member attribute has been changed by another user, the **Merge Conflicts** dialog will appear.  
  
3.  In the **Merge Conflicts** dialog, you can either:  
  
    -   Choose **Latest** and click **Apply** to undo the pending changes and reload the latest version from the server.  
  
    -   Choose **Original** and click **Apply** to apply the original version in the worksheet.  
  
    -   Choose **Yours** and click **Apply** to keep the existing local changes.  
  
4.  After you click **Apply**, you can make additional changes and publish again. Or you can click **Cancel** to cancel the update and reload the latest version from the server.
