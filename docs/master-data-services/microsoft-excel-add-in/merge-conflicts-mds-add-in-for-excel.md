# Merge Conflicts (MDS Add-in for Excel)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only - ASDBMI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] Add-in for Excel, if data has been changed on the server by another user, the publish will fail with a conflict error. To resolve this error, you can perform merge conflicts and republish the changes.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Explorer** functional area.  
  
-   You must have a minimum of Update permission to the leaf model object for the entity you are updating.  
  
-   The active worksheet must have MDS-managed data.  
  
-   The active worksheet must have a conflict error after you tried to publish your changes.  
  
### To merge conflicts  
  
1.  In the worksheet, select the row or cell that has the conflict error.  
  
2.  In the **Publish and Validate** menu group, select **Merge Conflicts** to open the **Merge Conflicts** dialog.  
  
3.  In the **Merge Conflicts** dialog, you can either:  
  
    -   Choose **Latest** and click **Apply** to undo the pending changes and reload the latest version from the server.  
  
    -   Choose **Original** and click **Apply** to apply the original version in the worksheet.  
  
    -   Choose **Yours** and click **Apply** to keep the existing local changes.  
  
4.  After you click **Apply**, you can make additional changes and publish again. Or you can click **Cancel** to cancel the update and reload the latest version from the server.
