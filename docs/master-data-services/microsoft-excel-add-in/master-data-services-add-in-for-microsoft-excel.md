# Master Data Services Add-in for Microsoft Excel

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only - ASDBMI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

With the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]&nbsp;[!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)], you can load filtered lists of data from Master Data Services (MDS) into Excel and then work with it just as you would any other data. When you are done, you can publish the data back to MDS where it's centrally stored. Security level determines which data you can view and update.  
  
If you're an administrator, you can use the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)] to create entities and attributes, which you can load with data. This process eliminates the need to use other tools to load data into your models.  
  
With the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)], you can use Data Quality Services (DQS) to match data before loading it into MDS. This feature helps to prevent duplicate data in MDS.

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware of the following size limitations when interacting with the workbook in MDS Excel add-in.
>
> - Excel on the web has a payload size limit for requests and responses of 5 MB. A `RichAPI.Error` will be thrown if that limit is exceeded.
> - A range is limited to five million cells for get operations.

## Terms

When working with the add-in, you might come across the following terms. For more information about these concepts, see [Master Data Services Overview &#40;MDS&#41;](../../master-data-services/master-data-services-overview-mds.md).  

- The *MDS repository* is where all master data is stored. It's a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database configured to store MDS data. To work with data from the repository, you load it into Excel. When you're done working with it, you publish the changes back to the repository. Administrators can add new entities and attributes to the repository.
  
- *MDS-managed data* is data stored in the MDS repository. When you load MDS-managed data into Excel, it's displayed as highlighted rows. You can also add data to your Excel worksheet that's not MDS-managed. Such data won't be affected if you refresh the MDS-managed data.

- A *model* is a data container. You can create versions of these containers. The latest version is usually the most recent. For more information, see [Models &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/models-master-data-services.md).  
  
- An *entity* is a list of data, like a table in a database. For example, the **Color** entity might contain a list of colors. For more information, see [Entities &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/entities-master-data-services.md).  
  
- A *member* is a record or a row of data. Each entity contains members. For example, **Blue** could be a member of the **Color** entity. For more information, see [Members &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/members-master-data-services.md).  
  
- An *attribute* is a column of data. Each member has attributes. For example, the **Code** attribute for the **Blue** member is **B**. For more information about attributes, see [Attributes &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/attributes-master-data-services.md).
