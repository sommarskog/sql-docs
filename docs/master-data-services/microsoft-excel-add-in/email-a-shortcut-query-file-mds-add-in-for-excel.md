# Email a Shortcut Query File (MDS Add-in for Excel)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only - ASDBMI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)], email a shortcut query file to someone when you want to ensure they're working with the same data that you are. You should share queries rather than saving the worksheet and emailing it.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have Outlook 2010 or later installed.  
  
-   You must have MDS-managed data in an active worksheet in Excel.  
  
### To send a shortcut query file  
  
1.  Ensure that the data in the worksheet is in the format you want to share. For more information about filtering data and reordering columns, see [Filter Data before Exporting &#40;MDS Add-in for Excel&#41;](../../master-data-services/microsoft-excel-add-in/filter-data-before-exporting-mds-add-in-for-excel.md) and [Reorder Columns &#40;MDS Add-in for Excel&#41;](../../master-data-services/microsoft-excel-add-in/reorder-columns-mds-add-in-for-excel.md).  
  
2.  In the **Save and Send** group, click **Send Query**. An email message opens and the shortcut query file is attached.  
  
## Next Steps  
  
-   To open the shortcut query file, the recipient of the email must have the MDS [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)] installed. The recipient can double-click the file to open it.
