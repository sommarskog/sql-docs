# Collection Permissions (Master Data Services)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  Collection permissions apply to all collections for an entity. You cannot give permission to a specific collection; permissions apply to all collections.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  These permissions apply to the **Explorer** functional area of the user interface only.  
  
|Permission|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|**Read**|User can read collection members and the member attributes.|  
|**Create**|User can create collection members and assign attribute values.|  
|**Update**|User can update collection members, attributes and relationships.|  
|**Delete**|User can delete collection members.|  
|**Deny**|Deny all access to the collection members.|  
  
 The Read, Create, Update, and Delete permissions can be combined. When Create, Update and Delete are assigned, the read permission is assigned automatically.
