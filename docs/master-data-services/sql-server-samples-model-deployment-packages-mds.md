# SQL Server Examples: Model Deployment Packages (MDS)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  Sample model packages with data are included when you install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]. The default location for these package files is \<drive>\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Master Data Services\Samples\Packages.  
  
 For instructions on how to deploy the sample model packages, see [Deploying Sample Models and Data](../master-data-services/master-data-services-installation-and-configuration.md#deploySample). You deploy the sample model packages by using the [MDSModelDeploy tool](../master-data-services/deploy-a-model-deployment-package-by-using-mdsmodeldeploy.md).

 In Master Data Services, a package is an XML file that contains a deployable model structure, and optionally, data from the model. Use model packages to move copies of models from one MDS environment to another, or to create new models in your existing [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] environment.
