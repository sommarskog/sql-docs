# Add a Group (Master Data Services)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  Add a group to the **Groups** list in [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] to begin the process of assigning permission to the Web application. Before a user in the group can access [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], you must give the group permission to one or more functional areas and model objects.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Users and Group Permissions** functional area.  
  
### To add a group  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **User and Group Permissions**.  
  
2.  On the **Users** page, from the menu bar, click **Manage Groups**.  
  
3.  Click **Add groups**.  
  
4.  Type the group's name preceded by the Active Directory domain name or by the server computer's name, as in *domain\group_name* or *computer\group_name*.  
  
5.  Optionally, click **Check names**.  
  
6.  Click **OK**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When the user first accesses [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], the user's name is added to the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] list of users.
