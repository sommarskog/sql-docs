# Add Multiple Conditions to a Business Rule (Master Data Services)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], add multiple **AND** or **OR** conditions to a business rule when you want a more complex rule.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you create a business rule that uses the **OR** operator, consider creating a separate rule for each conditional statement that can be evaluated independently. You can then exclude rules as needed, providing more flexibility and easier troubleshooting.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
-   A business rule must exist. For more information, see [Create and Publish a Business Rule &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/create-and-publish-a-business-rule-master-data-services.md).

    > [!TIP]  
    >  To delete a condition, select the condition and right-click on it and click **Delete**.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  You can select multiple conditions and right-click to group them inside a logical operator, or to ungroup conditions inside a specific logical operator.
