# Create a Changeset (Master Data Services)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  A changeset is a collection of the pending changes on the master data. If the entity requires approval for changes, the pending changes must be saved in a changeset and then submitted for administrator approval.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   You must have permission to access the Explorer functional area. For more information, see [Functional Area Permissions &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/functional-area-permissions-master-data-services.md)

2.  Click an entity on the **Entities** menu.  
  
3.  In the right pane, select **Changesets** and click **Create**.  
  
4.  Enter a name for the changeset, and click **Save**.  
  
     The name of the changeset must be unique within a model.  
  
## To create a changeset for approval
