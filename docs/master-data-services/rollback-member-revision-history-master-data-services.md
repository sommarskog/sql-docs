# Rollback Member Revision History (Master Data Services)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  A member revision history is recorded each time a member is changed. You can rollback a member revision history to a previous version.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   You must have permission to update at least one of the attributes of the selected member. When you rollback a revision history, all the attribute values that can be updated will be rolled back to the previous version values.  
  
-   Revision history is available only when the transaction log type of the entity is member.  
  
 **To rollback a member revision history**  
  
1.  In Master Data Manager, click Explorer.  
  
2.  Choose the entity and the member to rollback.  
  
3.  Click **View History.**  
  
4.  Choose the revision to rollback, and then click **Rollback**.
