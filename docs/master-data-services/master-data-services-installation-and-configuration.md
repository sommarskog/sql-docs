# Master Data Services Installation and Configuration

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  This article covers how to install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] on a Windows Server 2012 R2 machine, set up the MDS database and website, and deploy the sample models and data. [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] (MDS) enables your organization to manage a trusted version of data.   
  
> [!NOTE] 
> You can install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] on a Windows 10 machine when you use the Developer edition that now supports [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]. 
>>For more information on operating system support for different editions, [SQL Server 2019: Hardware and software requirements](../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server-2019.md).

## Internet Explorer and Silverlight
- When you install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] on a Windows Server 2012 machine, you may have to configure Internet Explorer Enhanced Security to allow scripting for the Web application site. Otherwise, browsing to the site on the server computer will fail.
- Prior to [!INCLUDE[sqlv15](../includes/sssql19-md.md)], to work in the Web application, Silverlight 5 must be installed on the client computer. If you do not have the required version of Silverlight, you will be prompted to install it when you navigate to an area of the Web application that requires it. You can install Silverlight 5 from **[here](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/)**.
- Starting in [!INCLUDE[sqlv15](../includes/sssql19-md.md)], HTML controls replace all former Silverlight components, therefore the Silverlight dependency removed. More browsers, including Chrome and Edge, now work for accessing the Master Data Services web app.

## [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] on an Azure Virtual Machine
By default, when you spin up an Azure Virtual Machine with [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion_md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] already installed, [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] is also installed. 

You're next step is to install Internet Information Services (IIS). See the [Installing and Configuring IIS](#InstallIIS) section. 

If you're interested in making changes to the installation of [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion_md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you'll find the setup.exe file in the default location, `<drive>`:\SQLServer_13.0_Full.

##  <a name="deploySample"></a> Deploying Sample Models and Data  
 The following three sample model packages are included with  [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)].   These sample models include data. **The default location for the sample model packages is %programfiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\140\Master Data Services\Samples\Packages.**
  
-   chartofaccounts_en.pkg  
-   customer_en.pkg  
-   product_en.pkg  
  
 You deploy the packages using the MDSModelDeploy tool. The default location for the MDSModelDeploy tool is *drive*\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\ 140\Master Data Services\Configuration.  
  
 For information about prerequisites for running this tool, see [Deploy a Model Deployment Package by Using MDSModelDeploy](../master-data-services/deploy-a-model-deployment-package-by-using-mdsmodeldeploy.md).  
  
 For information about updates made to the data to support new features in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], see [SQL Server Samples: Model Deployment Packages (MDS)](../master-data-services/sql-server-samples-model-deployment-packages-mds.md).  
  
 **To deploy the sample models**  
  
1.  Copy the sample model packages to *drive*\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\140\Master Data Services\Configuration.  
  
2.  Open an Administrator: Command Prompt and navigate to MDSModelDeploy.exe, by running the following command.  
  
    ```  
    cd c:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\140\Master Data Services\Configuration  
    ```  
  
3.  Deploy each of the sample models to [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] by running each of the following commands.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  In the examples below, the `MDS1` service value is specified. You use this value if you selected  **Default Web Site** when you set up the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] Web site.  See the [Setting up the Database and Website](#SetUpWeb) section.  
    >   
    >  If you created a new web site or selected another existing web site, run the following command first to determine the correct service value.  
    >   
    >  `MDSModelDeploy listservices`  
    >   
    >  The first service value in the list of values returned, is the one you specify to deploy a model.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > In order to know more about the metadata information of the sample models, please refer to the readme file available at this  location "c:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\140\Master Data Services\Configuration"
   
     **To deploy the chartofaccounts_en.pkg sample model**  
  
    ```console
    MDSModelDeploy deploynew -package chartofaccounts_en.pkg -model ChartofAccounts -service MDS1  
    ```
