# Delete a Member or Collection (Master Data Services)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], delete a member or collection when you no longer need it. If you want to delete members in bulk, use the staging tables instead. For more information, see [Import Data from Tables &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/import-data-from-tables-master-data-services.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot delete a member if it is used as a domain-based attribute value for another member.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Explorer** functional area.  
  
-   For members, you must have a minimum of **Delete** permission to the leaf model object you are deleting a member from.  
  
-   For collections, you must have a minimum of **Update** permission to the leaf collection object you are deleting.  
  
### To delete a member or collection  
  
1.  On the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] home page, from the **Model** list, select a model.  
  
2.  From the **Version** list, select a version.  
  
3.  Click **Explorer**.  
  
4.  To delete:  
  
    -   A leaf member, from the menu bar, point to **Entities** and click the name of the entity that contains the member.  
  
    -   A consolidated member, from the menu bar, point to **Hierarchies** and click the name of the hierarchy that contains the member. Then click the node in the hierarchy that contains the member.  
  
    -   A collection, from the menu bar, point to **Collections** and click the name of the entity that contains the collection.  
  
5.  In the grid, click the row of the member or collection you want to delete.  
  
6.  Click **Delete Member**, **Delete**, or **Delete Collection**.  
  
7.  Entity Administrators will also see a menu option to Purge (hard-delete) all soft-deleted members in the entity version.  
  
8.  In the confirmation dialog box, click **OK**.
