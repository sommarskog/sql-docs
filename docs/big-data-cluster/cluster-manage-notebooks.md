# An Index of Management notebooks for SQL Server Big Data Clusters

This page is an index of notebooks for SQL Server Big Data Clusters. These executable notebooks (.ipynb) manage Big Data Clusters for SQL Server 2019.

[!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-banner-retirement](../includes/bdc-banner-retirement.md)]

You can manage SQL Server Big Data Clusters with Jupyter notebooks. When you do, all notebooks check for their own dependencies. The **Run all cells** option either completes successfully or raises an exception with a hyperlinked *hint* to another notebook to resolve the missing dependency. Follow the hint hyperlink to the target notebook, click **Run all cells**. Upon successful completion, return to the original notebook and select **Run all cells**.

When all dependencies are installed and **Run all cells** fails, each notebook analyzes the results. Where possible, a hyperlinked hint gives direction on how to resolve the issue.

* For more information on using notebooks to manage SQL Server Big Data Clusters, see [Manage SQL Server Big Data Clusters with Azure Data Studio notebooks](notebooks-manage-bdc.md).
* For the location of big data cluster administration notebooks, see [Where to find SQL Server Big Data Clusters administration notebooks](view-cluster-status.md#where-to-find--administration-notebooks).
