# Deploy SQL Server Big Data Cluster with high availability

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

[!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-banner-retirement](../includes/bdc-banner-retirement.md)]

Because SQL Server Big Data Clusters is on Kubernetes as containerized applications, and uses features like stateful sets and persistent storage, this infrastructure has built-in health monitoring, failure detection, and failover mechanisms that cluster components leverage to maintain service health. For increased reliability, you can also configure SQL Server master instance and/or HDFS name node and Spark shared services to deploy with additional replicas in a high availability configuration. Monitoring, failure detection, and automatic failover are managed by the big data cluster management service, namely the control service. This service is provided without user intervention â€“ all from availability group setup, configuring database mirroring endpoints, to adding databases to the availability group or failover and upgrade coordination. 

The following image represents how an availability group is deployed in a SQL Server Big Data Cluster:

:::image type="content" source="media/deployment-high-availability/contained-ag.png" alt-text="high-availability-ag-bdc":::

Here are some of the capabilities that availability groups enable:

- If the high availability settings are specified in the deployment configuration file, a single availability group named `containedag` is created. By default, `containedag` has three replicas, including primary. All CRUD operations for the availability group are managed internally, including creating the availability group or joining replicas to the availability group created. Additional availability groups cannot be created in the SQL Server master instance in a big data cluster.
- All databases are automatically added to the availability group, including all user and system databases like `master` and `msdb`. This capability provides a single-system view across the availability group replicas. Additional model databases - `model_replicatedmaster` and `model_msdb` - are used to seed the replicated portion of the system databases. In addition to these databases, you will see `containedag_master` and `containedag_msdb` databases if you connect directly to the instance. The `containedag` databases represent the `master` and `msdb` inside the availability group.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Databases that are created on the instance as a result of a workflow, like attach database, aren't automatically added to the availability group. SQL Server Big Data Clusters administrators will have to do this manually. To learn how to enable a temporary endpoint to the SQL Server instance master database, see [Connect to SQL Server instance](#instance-connect). Before the SQL Server 2019 CU2 release, databases that were created as a result of a restore statement had the same behavior, and databases had to be added manually to the contained availability group.
  >

- PolyBase configuration databases are not included in the availability group because they include instance level metadata specific to each replica.
- An external endpoint is automatically provisioned for connecting to databases within the availability group. This endpoint `master-svc-external` plays the role of the availability group listener.
- A second external endpoint is provisioned for read-only connections to the secondary replicas to scale out the read workloads.

## Deploy

To deploy SQL Server master in an availability group:

1. Enable the `hadr` feature
1. Specify the number of replicas for the AG (minimum is 3)
1. Configure the details of the second external endpoint created for connections to the read-only secondary replicas

You can use either the `aks-dev-test-ha` or the `kubeadm-prod` built-in configuration profiles to start customizing your big data cluster. These profiles include the settings required for resources you can configure additional high availability. For example, below is a section in the `bdc.json` configuration file that is relevant for enabling availability groups for SQL Server master instance.  

```json
{
  ...
    "spec": {
      "type": "Master",
      "replicas": 3,
      "endpoints": [
        {
          "name": "Master",
          "serviceType": "LoadBalancer",
          "port": 31433
        },
        {
          "name": "MasterSecondary",
          "serviceType": "LoadBalancer",
          "port": 31436
        }
      ],
      "settings": {
        "sql": {
          "hadr.enabled": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  ...
}
```

The following steps walk through an example on how to start from `aks-dev-test-ha` profile and customize your big data cluster deployment configuration. For a deployment on a `kubeadm` cluster, similar steps would apply, but make sure you are using `NodePort` for the `serviceType` in the  `endpoints` section.

1. Clone your targeted profile

    ```bash
    azdata bdc config init --source aks-dev-test-ha --target custom-aks-ha
    ```

1. Optionally make any edits to the custom profile as necessary. 
1. Start cluster deployment using the cluster configuration profile created above

    ```bash
    azdata bdc create --config-profile custom-aks-ha --accept-eula yes
    ```

## Connect to SQL Server databases in the availability group

Depending on the type of workload you want to run against SQL Server master, you can connect either to the primary for read-write workloads or to the databases in the secondary replicas for read-only type of workloads. Here is an outline for each type of connection:

### Connect to databases on the primary replica

For connections to the primary replica, use `sql-server-master` endpoint. This endpoint is also the listener for the AG. When using this endpoint, all connections are in the context of databases within the availability group. For example, a default connection using this endpoint will result in connecting to the `master` database within the availability group, not the SQL Server instance `master` database. Run this command to find the endpoint:

```bash
azdata bdc endpoint list -e sql-server-master -o table
```

```
Description                           Endpoint             Name               Protocol
------------------------------------  -------------------  -----------------  ----------
SQL Server Master Instance Front-End  11.11.111.111,11111  sql-server-master  tds
```

> [!NOTE]
> Failover events can occur during a distributed query execution that is accessing data from remote data sources like HDFS or data pool. As a best practice, applications should be designed to have connection retry logic in case of disconnects caused by failover.  
>

### Connect to databases on the secondary replicas

For read-only connections to databases in secondary replicas, use the `sql-server-master-readonly` endpoint. This endpoint acts like a load balancer across all the secondary replicas.  When using this endpoint, all connections are in the context of databases within the availability group. For example, a default connection using this endpoint will result in connecting to the `master` database within the availability group, not the SQL Server instance `master` database. 

```bash
azdata bdc endpoint list -e sql-server-master-readonly -o table
```

```
Description                                    Endpoint            Name                        Protocol
---------------------------------------------  ------------------  --------------------------  ----------
SQL Server Master Readable Secondary Replicas  11.11.111.11,11111  sql-server-master-readonly  tds
```

## <a id="instance-connect"></a> Connect to SQL Server instance

For certain operations like setting server level configurations or manually adding a database to the availability group, you must connect to the SQL Server instance. Prior to SQL Server 2019 CU2, operations like `sp_configure`, `RESTORE DATABASE` or any availability groups DDL will require this type of connection. By default, big data cluster does not include an endpoint that enables instance connection and you must expose this endpoint manually. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The endpoint exposed for SQL Server instance connections only supports SQL authentication, even in clusters where Active Directory is enabled. By default, during a big data cluster deployment, `sa` login is disabled and a new `sysadmin` login is provisioned based in the values provided at deployment time for `AZDATA_USERNAME` and `AZDATA_PASSWORD` environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The contained availability group DDL is exclusively self managed in BDC. Any (external user) attempt to drop the contained avaialbility or the database mirroring endpoint is not supported and can result in unrecoverable BDC state.

Here is an example that shows how to expose this endpoint and then add the database that was created with a restore workflow to the availability group. Similar instructions for setting up a connection to the SQL Server master instance apply when you want to change server configurations with `sp_configure`.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with SQL Server 2019 CU2, databases created as result of a restore workflow are added automatically to the contained availability group.

- Determine the pod that hosts the primary replica by connecting to the `sql-server-master` endpoint and run:

    ```sql
    SELECT @@SERVERNAME
   ```

- Expose the external endpoint by creating a new Kubernetes service

    For a `kubeadm` cluster run below command. Replace `podName` with the name of the server returned at previous step, `serviceName` with the preferred name for the Kubernetes service created  and `namespaceName`* with the name of your big data cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n <namespaceName> expose pod <podName> --port=1533  --name=<serviceName> --type=NodePort
    ```

    For an aks cluster run, run the same command, except that the type of the service created will be `LoadBalancer`. For example: 

    ```bash
    kubectl -n <namespaceName> expose pod <podName> --port=1533  --name=<serviceName> --type=LoadBalancer
    ```

    Here is an example of this command run against aks, where the pod hosting the primary is `master-0`:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n mssql-cluster expose pod master-0 --port=1533  --name=master-sql-0 --type=LoadBalancer
    ```

    Get the IP of the Kubernetes service created:

    ```bash
    kubectl get services -n <namespaceName>
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As a best practice, you should cleanup by deleting the Kubernetes service created above by running this command:
>
>```bash
>kubectl delete svc master-sql-0 -n mssql-cluster
>```

- Add the database to the availability group.

    For the database to be added to the AG, it has to run in full recovery mode and a log backup has to be taken. Use the IP from the Kubernetes service created above and connect to the SQL Server instance then run the TSQL statements as shown below.

    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE <databaseName> SET RECOVERY FULL;
    BACKUP DATABASE <databaseName> TO DISK='<filePath>'
    ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP containedag ADD DATABASE <databaseName>
    ```

    The following example adds a database named `sales` that was restored on the instance:

    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE sales SET RECOVERY FULL;
    BACKUP DATABASE sales TO DISK='/var/opt/mssql/data/sales.bak'
    ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP containedag ADD DATABASE sales
    ```

## Known limitations

These are known issues and limitations with contained availability groups for SQL Server master in big data cluster:

- The high availability configuration must be created when big data cluster is deployed. You cannot enable the high availability configuration with availability groups post deployment. At this time, only configuration enabled is for synchronous commit replicas.

> [!WARNING]
> Updating the synchronization mode to asynchronous commit for any of the replicas in the  quorum commit, will result in an invalid configuration for high availability. Running in this configuration involves a data loss risk since in case of failure events affecting the primary replica, there is not an automatic failover triggered and the user must accept the risk for data loss when issuing manual failover.

- To successfully restore a TDE enabled database from a backup created on another server, you must ensure that that [required certificates](../relational-databases/security/encryption/move-a-tde-protected-database-to-another-sql-server.md) are restored on both SQL Server instance master as well as contained AG master. See [here](https://www.sqlshack.com/restoring-transparent-data-encryption-tde-enabled-databases-on-a-different-server/) for an example on how to backup and restore the certificates.
- Certain operations like running server configuration settings with `sp_configure` require a connection to the SQL Server instance `master` database, not the availability group `master`. You cannot use the corresponding primary endpoint. Follow [the instructions](#instance-connect) to expose an endpoint and connect to the SQL Server instance and run `sp_configure`. You can only use SQL authentication when manually exposing the endpoint to connect to the SQL Server instance `master` database.
- While contained msdb database is included in the availability group and the SQL Agent jobs are replicated across, the jobs are only running per schedule on the primary replica.
- Replication feature is not supported for contained availability groups. SQL Server instances part of a contained AG can not function as a distributor or publisher, at either the instance level or contained AG level.
- Adding file groups while creating the database is not supported. As a workaround, you can first create the database and then issue an ALTER DATABASE statement to add any file groups.
- Prior to SQL Server 2019 CU2, databases created as result of workflows other than `CREATE DATABASE` and `RESTORE DATABASE` like `CREATE DATABASE FROM SNAPSHOT` are not automatically added to the availability group. [Connect to the instance](#instance-connect) and add the database to the availability group manually.
- Service Broker and Database Mail are not currently supported on Big Data Clusters deployed with high availability.
