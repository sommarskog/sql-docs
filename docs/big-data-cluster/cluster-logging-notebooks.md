# Gathering and analyzing logs in Big Data Clusters by using notebooks

This page is an index of notebooks for SQL Server Big Data Clusters. Those executable notebooks (.ipynb) are designed for SQL Server 2019 to assist in logging big data clusters.

[!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-banner-retirement](../includes/bdc-banner-retirement.md)]

Each notebook is designed to check for its own dependencies. The **Run all cells** option either completes successfully or raises an exception with a hyperlinked *hint* to another notebook to resolve the missing dependency. Follow the hint hyperlink to the target notebook, click **Run all cells**. Upon success return back to the original notebook, then click **Run all cells**.

Once all dependencies are installed, but **Run all cells** fails, each notebook will analyze results and where possible, produce a hyperlinked hint to another notebook to further aid in resolving the issue.

* For more information on using notebooks to manage SQL Server Big Data Clusters, see [Manage SQL Server Big Data Clusters with Azure Data Studio notebooks](notebooks-manage-bdc.md).

## Gathering logs from Big Data Cluster

This section contains a set of notebooks useful for getting logs from a SQL Server Big Data Cluster.

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| TSG001 - Run azdata copy-logs | Use the azdata command line interface to copy data in big data clusters. |
| TSG061 - Get tail of all container logs for pods in BDC namespace | Get all container logs for pods from big data cluster in the namespace. |
| TSG062 - Get tail of all previous container logs for pods in BDC namespace | Get all previous container logs for pods from big data cluster in the namespace. |
| TSG083 - Run kubectl cluster-info dump | Use the kubetl command line interface to dump big data cluster-related information. |
| TSG084 - Internal Query Processor Error | Using DMV query to get more information on the internal query processor error. |
| TSG091 - Get the azdata CLI logs | Get the azdata logs from the local machine. |



## Analyze logs from Big Data Clusters

A set of notebooks to gather and analyze logs from a SQL Server big data cluster.  The analysis process will suggest follow-on notebooks to run for known issue found in the logs.
