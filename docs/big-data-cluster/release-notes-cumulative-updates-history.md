## <a id="cu5"></a> CU5 (June 2020)

Cumulative Update 5 (CU5) release for SQL Server Big Data Clusters.

| Package version | Image tag |
| --- | --- |
| 15.0.4043.16 | [2019-CU5-ubuntu-16.04] |

### Added capabilities

- Support for Big Data Clusters deployment on Red Hat OpenShift. Support includes OpenShift container platform deployed on premises version 4.3 and up and Azure Red Hat OpenShift. See [Deploy SQL Server Big Data Clusters on OpenShift](deploy-openshift.md)
- Updated the BDC deployment security model so privileged containers deployed as part of BDC are no longer *required*. In addition to non-privileged, containers are running as non-root user by default for all new deployments using SQL Server Big Data Clusters CU5.
- Added support for deploying multiple big data clusters against an Active Directory domain.
- [!INCLUDE[azure-data-cli-azdata](../includes/azure-data-cli-azdata.md)] has its own semantic version, independent from the server. Any dependency between the client and the server version of azdata is removed. We recommend using the latest version for both client and server to ensure you are benefiting from latest enhancements and fixes.
- Introduced two new stored procedures,  sp_data_source_objects and sp_data_source_table_columns, to support introspection of certain External Data Sources. They can be used by customers directly via T-SQL for schema discovery and to see what tables are available to be virtualized. We leverage these changes in the External Table Wizard of the [Data Virtualization Extension](../azure-data-studio/extensions/data-virtualization-extension.md) for  Azure Data Studio, which allows you to create external tables from SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB, and Teradata.
- Added support to persist customizations performed in Grafana. Before CU5, customers would notice that any edits in Grafana configurations would be lost upon `metricsui` pod (that hosts Grafana dashboard) restart. This issue is fixed and all configurations are now persisted.
- Fixed security issue related to the API used to collect pod and node metrics using Telegraf (hosted in the `metricsdc` pods). As a result of this change, Telegraf now requires a service account, cluster role, and cluster bindings to have the necessary permissions to collect the pod and node metrics. See [Custer role required for pods and nodes metrics collection](kubernetes-rbac.md#cluster-role-required-for-pods-and-nodes-metrics-collection) for more details.
- Added two feature switches to control the collection of pod and node metrics. In case you are using different solutions for monitoring your Kubernetes infrastructure, you can turn off the built-in metrics collection for pods and host nodes by setting *allowNodeMetricsCollection* and *allowPodMetricsCollection* to false in control.json deployment configuration file. For OpenShift environments, these settings are set to false by default in the built-in deployment profiles, since collecting pod and node metrics required privileged capabilities.
