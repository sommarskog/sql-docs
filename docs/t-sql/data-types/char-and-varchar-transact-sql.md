# char and varchar (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Character data types that are either fixed-size, **char**, or variable-size, **varchar**. Starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)], when a UTF-8 enabled collation is used, these data types store the full range of [Unicode](../../relational-databases/collations/collation-and-unicode-support.md#Unicode_Defn) character data and use the [UTF-8](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) character encoding. If a non-UTF-8 collation is specified, then these data types store only a subset of characters supported by the corresponding code page of that collation.

## Arguments

#### char [ ( *n* ) ]

Fixed-size string data. *n* defines the string size in bytes and must be a value from 1 through 8,000. For single-byte encoding character sets such as `Latin`, the storage size is *n* bytes and the number of characters that can be stored is also *n*. For multibyte encoding character sets, the storage size is still *n* bytes but the number of characters that can be stored may be smaller than *n*. The ISO synonym for **char** is **character**. For more information on character sets, see [Single-Byte and Multibyte Character Sets](/cpp/c-runtime-library/single-byte-and-multibyte-character-sets).

#### varchar [ ( *n* | max ) ]

Variable-size string data. Use *n* to define the string size in bytes and can be a value from 1 through 8,000, or use **max** to indicate a column constraint size up to a maximum storage of 2^31-1 bytes (2 GB). For single-byte encoding character sets such as `Latin`, the storage size is *n* bytes + 2 bytes and the number of characters that can be stored is also *n*. For multibyte encoding character sets, the storage size is still *n* bytes + 2 bytes but the number of characters that can be stored may be smaller than *n*. The ISO synonyms for **varchar** are **charvarying** or **charactervarying**. For more information on character sets, see [Single-Byte and Multibyte Character Sets](/cpp/c-runtime-library/single-byte-and-multibyte-character-sets).

## Remarks

A common misconception is to think that with **char(*n*)** and **varchar(*n*)**, the *n* defines the number of characters. However, in **char(*n*)** and **varchar(*n*)**, the *n* defines the string length in **bytes** (0 to 8,000). *n* never defines numbers of characters that can be stored. This is similar to the definition of [**nchar(*n*)** and **nvarchar(*n*)**](../../t-sql/data-types/nchar-and-nvarchar-transact-sql.md).

The misconception happens because when using single-byte encoding, the storage size of char and varchar is *n* bytes and the number of characters is also *n*. However, for multibyte encoding such as [UTF-8](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), higher Unicode ranges (128 to 1,114,111) result in one character using two or more bytes. For example, in a column defined as **char(10)**, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] can store 10 characters that use single-byte encoding (Unicode range 0 to 127), but fewer than 10 characters when using multibyte encoding (Unicode range 128 to 1,114,111). For more information about Unicode storage and character ranges, see [Storage differences between UTF-8 and UTF-16](../../relational-databases/collations/collation-and-unicode-support.md#storage_differences).

When *n* isn't specified in a data definition or variable declaration statement, the default length is 1. If *n* isn't specified when using the `CAST` and `CONVERT` functions, the default length is 30.

Objects that use **char** or **varchar** are assigned the default collation of the database, unless a specific collation is assigned using the `COLLATE` clause. The collation controls the code page that is used to store the character data.

Multibyte encodings in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] include:

- Double-byte character sets (DBCS) for some East Asian languages using code pages 936 and 950 (Chinese), 932 (Japanese), or 949 (Korean).

- UTF-8 with code page 65001.

  **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] and later versions.

If you have sites that support multiple languages:

- Starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)], consider using a UTF-8 enabled collation to support Unicode and minimize character conversion issues.
- If using a previous version of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], consider using the Unicode **nchar** or **nvarchar** data types to minimize character conversion issues.

If you use **char** or **varchar**, we recommend that you:

- Use **char** when the sizes of the column data entries are consistent.
- Use **varchar** when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably.
- Use **varchar(max)** when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably, and the string length might exceed 8,000 bytes.

If `SET ANSI_PADDING` is `OFF` when either `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` is executed, a **char** column that is defined as NULL is handled as **varchar**.

> [!WARNING]  
> Each non-null **varchar(max)** or **nvarchar(max)** column requires 24 bytes of additional fixed allocation, which counts against the 8,060 byte row limit during a sort operation. This can create an implicit limit to the number of non-null **varchar(max)** or **nvarchar(max)** columns that can be created in a table.
>
> No special error is provided when the table is created (beyond the usual warning that the maximum row size exceeds the allowed maximum of 8,060 bytes) or at the time of data insertion. This large row size can cause errors (such as error 512) during some normal operations, such as a clustered index key update, or sorts of the full column set, which will only occur while performing an operation.

## <a id="_character"></a> Convert character data

When character expressions are converted to a character data type of a different size, values that are too long for the new data type are truncated. The **uniqueidentifier** type is considered a character type for the purposes of conversion from a character expression, and so is subject to the truncation rules for converting to a character type. See the [Examples](#examples) section.

When a character expression is converted to a character expression of a different data type or size, such as from **char(5)** to **varchar(5)**, or **char(20)** to **char(15)**, the collation of the input value is assigned to the converted value. If a noncharacter expression is converted to a character data type, the default collation of the current database is assigned to the converted value. In either case, you can assign a specific collation by using the [COLLATE](../../t-sql/statements/collations.md) clause.

> [!NOTE]  
> Code page translations are supported for **char** and **varchar** data types, but not for the **text** data type. As with earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], data loss during code page translations isn't reported.

Character expressions that are being converted to an approximate **numeric** data type can include optional exponential notation. This notation is a lowercase `e` or uppercase `E` followed by an optional plus (`+`) or minus (`-`) sign and then a number.

Character expressions that are being converted to an exact **numeric** data type must consist of digits, a decimal point, and an optional plus (`+`) or minus (`-`). Leading blanks are ignored. Comma separators, such as the thousands separator in `123,456.00`, aren't allowed in the string.

Character expressions being converted to **money** or **smallmoney** data types can also include an optional decimal point and dollar sign (`$`). Comma separators, as in `$123,456.00`, are allowed.

When an empty string gets converted to an **int**, its value becomes `0`. When an empty string gets converted to a date, its value becomes the [default value for date](date-transact-sql.md) - which is `1900-01-01`.

## Examples

### A. Show the default value of *n* when used in variable declaration

The following example shows the default value of *n* is 1 for the **char** and **varchar** data types when they are used in variable declaration.

```sql
DECLARE @myVariable AS VARCHAR = 'abc';
DECLARE @myNextVariable AS CHAR = 'abc';
--The following returns 1
SELECT DATALENGTH(@myVariable), DATALENGTH(@myNextVariable);
GO
```

### B. Show the default value of *n* when varchar is used with CAST and CONVERT

The following example shows that the default value of *n* is 30 when the **char** or **varchar** data types are used with the `CAST` and `CONVERT` functions.

```sql
DECLARE @myVariable AS VARCHAR(40);
SET @myVariable = 'This string is longer than thirty characters';
SELECT CAST(@myVariable AS VARCHAR);
SELECT DATALENGTH(CAST(@myVariable AS VARCHAR)) AS 'VarcharDefaultLength';
SELECT CONVERT(CHAR, @myVariable);
SELECT DATALENGTH(CONVERT(CHAR, @myVariable)) AS 'VarcharDefaultLength';
```

### C. Convert data for display purposes

The following example converts two columns to character types and applies a style that applies a specific format to the displayed data. A **money** type is converted to character data and style `1` is applied, which displays the values with commas every three digits to the left of the decimal point, and two digits to the right of the decimal point. A **datetime** type is converted to character data and style `3` is applied, which displays the data in the format `dd/mm/yy`. In the `WHERE` clause, a **money** type is cast to a character type to perform a string comparison operation.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
SELECT BusinessEntityID,
   SalesYTD,
   CONVERT (VARCHAR(12),SalesYTD,1) AS MoneyDisplayStyle1,
   GETDATE() AS CurrentDate,
   CONVERT(VARCHAR(12), GETDATE(), 3) AS DateDisplayStyle3
FROM Sales.SalesPerson
WHERE CAST(SalesYTD AS VARCHAR(20) ) LIKE '1%';
```

[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
BusinessEntityID SalesYTD              DisplayFormat CurrentDate             DisplayDateFormat

288              1827066.7118          1,827,066.71  2011-05-07 14:29:01.193 07/05/11
```

### D. Convert uniqueidentifer data

The following example converts a **uniqueidentifier** value to a **char** data type.

```sql
DECLARE @myid uniqueidentifier = NEWID();
SELECT CONVERT(CHAR(255), @myid) AS 'char';
```

The following example demonstrates the truncation of data when the value is too long for the data type being converted to. Because the **uniqueidentifier** type is limited to 36 characters, the characters that exceed that length are truncated.

```sql
DECLARE @ID NVARCHAR(max) = N'0E984725-C51C-4BF4-9960-E1C80E27ABA0wrong';
SELECT @ID, CONVERT(uniqueidentifier, @ID) AS TruncatedValue;
```

[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

```output
String                                       TruncatedValue
-------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------
0E984725-C51C-4BF4-9960-E1C80E27ABA0wrong    0E984725-C51C-4BF4-9960-E1C80E27ABA0

(1 row(s) affected)
```
