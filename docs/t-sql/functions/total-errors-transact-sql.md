# &#x40;&#x40;TOTAL_ERRORS (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

  Returns the number of disk write errors encountered by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] since [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] last started.  
  
 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
@@TOTAL_ERRORS  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return Types
 **integer**  
  
## Remarks  
 Not all write errors encountered by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are accounted for by this function. Occasional non-fatal write errors are handled by the server itself and are not considered errors. To display a report containing several [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] statistics, including total number of errors, run **sp_monitor**.  
  
## Examples  
 This example shows the number of errors encountered by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] as of the current date and time.  
  
```sql
SELECT @@TOTAL_ERRORS AS 'Errors', GETDATE() AS 'As of';  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
```  
Errors      As of
