# APP_NAME (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

This function returns the application name for the current session, if the application sets that name value.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The client provides the application name, and `APP_NAME` does not verify the application name value in any way. Do not use `APP_NAME` as part of a security check.

## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
APP_NAME  ( )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return Types
**nvarchar(128)**
  
## Remarks  
Use `APP_NAME` to distinguish between different applications, as a way to perform different actions for those applications. For example, `APP_NAME` can distinguish between different applications, which allows for a different date format for each application. It can also allow for the return of an informational message to certain applications.
  
To set an application name in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], click **Options** in the **Connect to Database Engine** dialog box. On the **Additional Connection Parameters** tab, provide an **app** attribute in the format `;app='application_name'`
  
## Example  
This example checks whether the client application that initiated this process is a `SQL Server Management Studio` session. It then provides a date value in either US or ANSI format.
  
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
GO  
IF APP_NAME() = 'Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio - Query'  
PRINT 'This process was started by ' + APP_NAME() + '. The date is ' + CONVERT ( VARCHAR(100) , GETDATE(), 101) + '.';  
ELSE   
PRINT 'This process was started by ' + APP_NAME() + '. The date is ' + CONVERT ( VARCHAR(100) , GETDATE(), 102) + '.';  
GO  
```
