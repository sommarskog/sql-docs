# &#x40;&#x40;MAX_CONNECTIONS (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

  Returns the maximum number of simultaneous user connections allowed on an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The number returned is not necessarily the number currently configured.

## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql  
@@MAX_CONNECTIONS  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return Types
 **integer**  
  
## Remarks  
 The actual number of user connections allowed also depends on the version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that is installed and the limitations of your applications and hardware.  
  
 To reconfigure [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] for fewer connections, use **sp_configure**.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows returning the maximum number of user connections on an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The example assumes that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has not been reconfigured for fewer user connections.  
  
```sql 
SELECT @@MAX_CONNECTIONS AS 'Max Connections';  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
```  
Max Connections  
---------------  
32767            
```
