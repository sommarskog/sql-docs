## Return Types
 **nvarchar**  
  
## Remarks  
 PUBLISHINGSERVERNAME is used in all types of replication.  
  
 PUBLISHINGSERVERNAME is used when a database mirroring session exists on the publication database between the Publisher and a mirror partner instance.  
  
 This function must be executed within the context of a publication database. When PUBLISHINGSERVERNAME is executed on a publication database at the mirror server instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the name of the Publisher instance from which the published database originates is returned. When this function is executed on a database at the mirror server instance that is not published or that is published from the mirror server instance after a failover, the name of the mirror server instance is returned. When this function is executed at the original Publisher instance, the name of the Publisher is returned.
