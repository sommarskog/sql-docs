# ERROR_LINE (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

This function returns the line number of occurrence of an error that caused the CATCH block of a TRY...CATCH construct to execute.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
ERROR_LINE ( )
```

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return Type
**int**

## Return Value  
When called in a CATCH block, `ERROR_LINE` returns  
  
-   the line number where the error occurred    
-   the line number in a routine, if the error occurred within a stored procedure or trigger  
-   NULL, if called outside the scope of a CATCH block.  
  
## Remarks  
A call to `ERROR_LINE` can happen anywhere within the scope of a CATCH block.  
  
`ERROR_LINE` returns the line number at which the error occurred. This happens regardless of the location of the `ERROR_LINE` call within the scope of the CATCH block, and regardless of the number of calls to `ERROR_LINE`. This contrasts with functions, such as @@ERROR. @@ERROR returns an error number in the statement immediately following the one that causes an error, or in the first statement of a CATCH block.  
  
In nested CATCH blocks, `ERROR_LINE` returns the error line number specific to the scope of the CATCH block in which it is referenced. For example, the CATCH block of a TRY...CATCH construct could contain a nested TRY...CATCH construct. Within the nested CATCH block, `ERROR_LINE` returns the line number for the error that invoked the nested CATCH block. If `ERROR_LINE` runs in the outer CATCH block, it returns the line number for the error that invoked that specific CATCH block.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using ERROR_LINE in a CATCH block  
This code example shows a `SELECT` statement that generates a divide-by-zero error. `ERROR_LINE` returns the line number where the error occurred.  
  
```sql  
BEGIN TRY  
    -- Generate a divide-by-zero error.  
    SELECT 1/0;  
END TRY  
BEGIN CATCH  
    SELECT ERROR_LINE() AS ErrorLine;  
END CATCH;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Using ERROR_LINE in a CATCH block with a stored procedure  
This example shows a stored procedure that generates a divide-by-zero error. `ERROR_LINE` returns the line number where the error occurred.  
  
```sql  
-- Verify that the stored procedure does not already exist.  
IF OBJECT_ID ( 'usp_ExampleProc', 'P' ) IS NOT NULL   
    DROP PROCEDURE usp_ExampleProc;  
GO  
  
-- Create a stored procedure that  
-- generates a divide-by-zero error.  
CREATE PROCEDURE usp_ExampleProc  
AS  
    SELECT 1/0;  
GO  
  
BEGIN TRY  
    -- Execute the stored procedure inside the TRY block.  
    EXECUTE usp_ExampleProc;  
END TRY  
BEGIN CATCH  
    SELECT ERROR_LINE() AS ErrorLine;  
END CATCH;  
GO  
``` 


### C. Using ERROR_LINE in a CATCH block with other error-handling tools  
This code example shows a `SELECT` statement that generates a divide-by-zero error. `ERROR_LINE` returns the line number where the error occurred, and information relating to the error itself.  
  
```sql  
BEGIN TRY  
    -- Generate a divide-by-zero error.  
    SELECT 1/0;  
END TRY  
BEGIN CATCH  
    SELECT  
        ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber,  
        ERROR_SEVERITY() AS ErrorSeverity,  
        ERROR_STATE() AS ErrorState,  
        ERROR_PROCEDURE() AS ErrorProcedure,  
        ERROR_LINE() AS ErrorLine,  
        ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;  
END CATCH;  
GO  
```
