# OPENDATASOURCE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - ASDBMI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

  Provides ad hoc connection information as part of a four-part object name without using a linked server name.  

 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
OPENDATASOURCE ( 'provider_name', 'init_string' )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments

#### '*provider_name*'  
 Is the name registered as the PROGID of the OLE DB provider used to access the data source. *provider_name* is a **char** data type, with no default value.  

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > [!INCLUDE[snac-removed-oledb-only](../../includes/snac-removed-oledb-only.md)]

 #### '*init_string*'  
 Is the connection string passed to the IDataInitialize interface of the destination provider. The provider string syntax is based on keyword-value pairs separated by semicolons, such as: **'**_keyword1_=_value_ **;** _keyword2_=_value_**'**.  
  
 For specific keyword-value pairs supported on the provider, see the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Data Access SDK. This documentation defines the basic syntax. The following table lists the most frequently used keywords in the *init_string* argument.  
  
|Keyword|OLE DB property|Valid values and description|  
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|  
|Data Source|DBPROP_INIT_DATASOURCE|Name of the data source to connect to. Different providers interpret this in different ways. For [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider, this indicates the name of the server. For Jet OLE DB provider, this indicates the full path of the .mdb file or .xls file.|  
|Location|DBPROP_INIT_LOCATION|Location of the database to connect to.|  
|Extended Properties|DBPROP_INIT_PROVIDERSTRING|The provider-specific connect-string.|  
|Connect timeout|DBPROP_INIT_TIMEOUT|Time out value after which the connection try fails.|  
|User ID|DBPROP_AUTH_USERID|User ID to be used for the connection.|  
|Password|DBPROP_AUTH_PASSWORD|Password to be used for the connection.|  
|Catalog|DBPROP_INIT_CATALOG|The name of the initial or default catalog when connecting to the data source.|  
|Integrated Security|DBPROP_AUTH_INTEGRATED|SSPI, to specify Windows Authentication|  
  
## Remarks  
`OPENROWSET` always inherits the instance collation, irrespective of collation set for columns.

`OPENDATASOURCE` can be used to access remote data from OLE DB data sources only when the DisallowAdhocAccess registry option is explicitly set to 0 for the specified provider, and the Ad Hoc Distributed Queries advanced configuration option is enabled. When these options are not set, the default behavior does not allow for ad hoc access.  
  
The `OPENDATASOURCE` function can be used in the same [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] syntax locations as a linked-server name. Therefore, `OPENDATASOURCE` can be used as the first part of a four-part name that refers to a table or view name in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, or to a remote stored procedure in an EXECUTE statement. When executing remote stored procedures, `OPENDATASOURCE` should refer to another instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. OPENDATASOURCE does not accept variables for its arguments.  
  
Like the `OPENROWSET` function, `OPENDATASOURCE` should only reference OLE DB data sources that are accessed infrequently. Define a linked server for any data sources accessed more than several times. Neither OPENDATASOURCE nor OPENROWSET provides all the functionality of linked-server definitions, such as security management and the ability to query catalog information. All connection information, including passwords, must be provided every time that OPENDATASOURCE is called.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Windows Authentication is much more secure than [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication. You should use Windows Authentication whenever possible. `OPENDATASOURCE` should not be used with explicit passwords in the connection string.  
  
The connection requirements for each provider are similar to the requirements for those parameters when creating linked servers. The details for many common providers are listed in the article [sp_addlinkedserver &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-addlinkedserver-transact-sql.md).  
  
Any call to `OPENDATASOURCE`, `OPENQUERY`, or `OPENROWSET` in the `FROM` clause is evaluated separately and independently from any call to these functions used as the target of the update, even if identical arguments are supplied to the two calls. In particular, filter or join conditions applied on the result of one of those calls has no effect on the results of the other.  
  
## Permissions  
 Any user can execute OPENDATASOURCE. The permissions that are used to connect to the remote server are determined from the connection string.  
  
## Examples  

### A. Using OPENDATASOURCE with SELECT and the SQL Server OLE DB Driver  
 The following example uses the [Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](../../connect/oledb/oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md) to access the `HumanResources.Department` table in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database on the remote server `Seattle1`. 
 A `SELECT` statement is used to define the row set returned. The provider string contains the `Server` and `Trusted_Connection` keywords. These keywords are recognized by the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] OLE DB Driver.  
  
```sql  
SELECT GroupName, Name, DepartmentID  
FROM OPENDATASOURCE('MSOLEDBSQL', 'Server=Seattle1;Database=AdventureWorks2022;TrustServerCertificate=Yes;Trusted_Connection=Yes;').HumanResources.Department  
ORDER BY GroupName, Name;  
``` 

### B. Using OPENDATASOURCE with SELECT and the SQL Server OLE DB Provider  
The following example creates an ad hoc connection to the `Payroll` instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on server `London`, and queries the `AdventureWorks2022.HumanResources.Employee` table. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Using SQLNCLI will redirect [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to the latest version of SQL Server Native Client OLE DB Provider. The OLE DB provider is expected to be registered with the specified PROGID in the registry. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> SQL Server Native Client OLE DB provider (SQLNCLI) remains deprecated and it is not recommended to use it for new development work. Instead, use the new [Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](../../connect/oledb/oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md) (MSOLEDBSQL) which will be updated with the most recent server features.
  
```sql  
SELECT *  
FROM OPENDATASOURCE('SQLNCLI',  
    'Data Source=London\Payroll;Integrated Security=SSPI')  
    .AdventureWorks2022.HumanResources.Employee;  
```  

### C. Using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Jet   
 The following example creates an ad hoc connection to an Excel spreadsheet in the 1997 - 2003 format.  
  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM OPENDATASOURCE('Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0',  
    'Data Source=C:\DataFolder\Documents\TestExcel.xls;Extended Properties=EXCEL 5.0')...[Sheet1$] ;  
```
