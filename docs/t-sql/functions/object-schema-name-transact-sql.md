# OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa.md)]

  Returns the database schema name for schema-scoped objects. For a list of schema-scoped objects, see [sys.objects (Transact-SQL)](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-objects-transact-sql.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> The function `OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME` is only supported in dedicated SQL pools in [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse_md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)].

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME ( object_id [, database_id ] )  
```  

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments

#### *object_id*  
 The ID of the object to be used. *object_id* is **int** and is assumed to be a schema-scoped object in the specified database, or in the current database context.  

#### *database_id*  
 The ID of the database where the object is to be looked up. *database_id* is **int**.  

## Return Types

 **sysname**  

## Exceptions

 Returns NULL on error or if a caller does not have permission to view the object. If the target database has the AUTO_CLOSE option set to ON, the function opens the database.  

 A user can only view the metadata of securables that the user owns or on which the user has been granted permission. Metadata-emitting, built-in functions such as `OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME` may return NULL if the user doesn't have any permission on the object. For more information, see [Metadata Visibility Configuration](../../relational-databases/security/metadata-visibility-configuration.md).  

## Permissions

 Requires ANY permission on the object. To specify a database ID, CONNECT permission to the database is also required, or the guest account must be enabled.  

## Remarks

 System functions can be used in the select list, in the WHERE clause, and anywhere an expression is allowed. For more information, see [Expressions](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) and [WHERE](../../t-sql/queries/where-transact-sql.md).  

 The result set returned by this system function uses the collation of the current database.  

 If *database_id* is not specified, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] assumes that `object_id` is in the context of the current database. A query that references an `object_id` in another database returns NULL or incorrect results. For example, in the following query, the context of the current database is [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] tries to return an object schema name for the specified `object_id` in current database instead of the database specified in the FROM clause of the query. Therefore, incorrect information is returned.  

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(object_id)  
FROM master.sys.objects;  
```  

 The following example specifies the database ID for the `master` database in the `OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME` function and returns the correct results.  

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(object_id, 1) AS schema_name  
FROM master.sys.objects;   
```  

## Examples

### A. Return the object schema name and object name

*Applies to:* [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/_ssnoversion.md)] [!INCLUDE [Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/_asdb.md)] [!INCLUDE [SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/_asmi.md)]

 The following example returns the object schema name, object name, and SQL text for all cached query plans that are not ad hoc or prepared statements. 

```sql
SELECT DB_NAME(st.dbid) AS database_name,   
    OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(st.objectid, st.dbid) AS schema_name,  
    OBJECT_NAME(st.objectid, st.dbid) AS object_name,   
    st.text AS query_statement  
FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats AS qs  
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) AS st  
WHERE st.objectid IS NOT NULL;  
GO  
```  

### B. Return three-part object names

The following example returns the database, schema, and object name for all objects in the current database context.

```sql
SELECT QUOTENAME(DB_NAME(db_id()))   
    + N'.'   
    + QUOTENAME(OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(object_id, db_id()))   
    + N'.'   
    + QUOTENAME(OBJECT_NAME(object_id, db_id()))  
    , *   
FROM sys.objects;
GO  
```

 The following example returns the database, schema, and object name along with all other columns in the `sys.dm_db_index_operational_stats` dynamic management view for all objects in all databases.  

*Applies to:* [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/_ssnoversion.md)] [!INCLUDE [Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/_asdb.md)] [!INCLUDE [SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/_asmi.md)]

```sql
SELECT QUOTENAME(DB_NAME(database_id))   
    + N'.'   
    + QUOTENAME(OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME(object_id, database_id))   
    + N'.'   
    + QUOTENAME(OBJECT_NAME(object_id, database_id))  
    , *   
FROM sys.dm_db_index_operational_stats(null, null, null, null);  
GO  
```
