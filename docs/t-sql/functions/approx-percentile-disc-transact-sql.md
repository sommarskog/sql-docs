# APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2022 Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2022-asdb-asmi.md)]

This function returns the value from the set of values in a group based on the provided percentile and sort specification. Since this is an approximate function, the output would be within rank based error bound with certain confidence. As this approximate percentile is based on a discrete distribution of the column values, the output value would be equal to one of the specific values in the column. This function can be used as an alternative to PERCENTILE_DISC for large datasets where negligible error with faster response is acceptable as compared to accurate percentile value with slow response time.

[Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC (numeric_literal)  
WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY order_by_expression [ASC|DESC])
```

## Argument

*numeric_literal*

The percentile to compute. The value must range between 0.0 and 1.0. to calculate 10th percentile, the value passed would be 0.10.

*order_by_expression*

Specifies a list of values to sort and compute the percentile over. The default sort order is ascending (ASC).  Only numeric data types are allowed. The expression must evaluate to a supported exact or approximate numeric type, with no other data types allowed. Supported exact numeric types are int, bigint, smallint, tinyint, bit, smallmoney, and money. Supported approximate numeric types are float and real. Decimal and float data types are not supported. 

## Return types

The return type is determined by the *order_by_expression* type.

## Remarks

Any nulls in the data set are ignored.

Approximate percentile functions use KLL sketch. The sketch is built by reading the stream of data.

This function provides rank-based error guarantees not value based. The function implementation guarantees up to a 1.33% error rate within a 99% probability.

## Known behaviors

- The output of the functions may not be the same in all executions. The algorithm used for these functions is [KLL sketch](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05346v2.pdf) which is a randomized algorithm. Every time the sketch is built, random values are picked. These functions provide rank-based error guarantees not value based.

- The function implementation guarantees up to a 1.33% error bounds within a 99% confidence.

## Compatibility support

Under compatibility level 110 and higher, WITHIN GROUP is a reserved keyword. For more information, see [ALTER DATABASE Compatibility Level (Transact-SQL).](../statements/alter-database-transact-sql-compatibility-level.md).

## Examples

The following example creates a table, populates it and runs the sample query.

```sql
SET NOCOUNT ON
GO
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tblEmployee
GO
CREATE TABLE tblEmployee (
EmplId INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED,
DeptId INT,
Salary int);
GO
INSERT INTO tblEmployee
VALUES (1, 31),(1, 33), (1, 18), (2, 25),(2, 35),(2, 10), (2, 10),(3,1), (3,NULL), (4,NULL), (4,NULL)
GO
SELECT DeptId,
APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC(0.10) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY Salary) AS 'P10',
APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC(0.90) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY Salary) AS 'P90'
FROM tblEmployee
GROUP BY DeptId
```
