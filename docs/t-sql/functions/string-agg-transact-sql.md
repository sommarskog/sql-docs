# STRING_AGG (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2017-asdb-asdbmi-asa-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2017-asdb-asdbmi-asa-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Concatenates the values of string expressions and places separator values between them. The separator isn't added at the end of string. 
 
 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
STRING_AGG ( expression, separator ) [ <order_clause> ]

<order_clause> ::=   
    WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY <order_by_expression_list> [ ASC | DESC ] )   
```

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments

*expression*  
Is an [expression](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) of any type. Expressions are converted to `NVARCHAR` or `VARCHAR` types during concatenation. Non-string types are converted to `NVARCHAR` type.

*separator*  
Is an [expression](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) of `NVARCHAR` or `VARCHAR` type that is used as separator for concatenated strings. It can be literal or variable. 

<order_clause>   
Optionally specify order of concatenated results using `WITHIN GROUP` clause:

```syntaxsql
WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY <order_by_expression_list> [ ASC | DESC ] )
```   
<order_by_expression_list>   
 
  A list of non-constant [expressions](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) that can be used for sorting results. Only one `order_by_expression` is allowed per query. The default sort order is ascending.   
  
## Return Types

Return type depends on first argument (expression). If input argument is string type (`NVARCHAR`, `VARCHAR`), result type will be same as input type. The following table lists automatic conversions:  

|Input expression type |Result | 
|-------|-------|
|NVARCHAR(MAX) |NVARCHAR(MAX) |
|VARCHAR(MAX) |VARCHAR(MAX) |
|NVARCHAR(1...4000) |NVARCHAR(4000) |
|VARCHAR(1...8000) |VARCHAR(8000) |
|int, bigint, smallint, tinyint, numeric, float, real, bit, decimal, smallmoney, money, datetime, datetime2, |NVARCHAR(4000) |

## Remarks

`STRING_AGG` is an aggregate function that takes all expressions from rows and concatenates them into a single string. Expression values are implicitly converted to string types and then concatenated. The implicit conversion to strings follows the existing rules for data type conversions. For more information about data type conversions, see [CAST and CONVERT (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/functions/cast-and-convert-transact-sql.md). 

If the input expression is type `VARCHAR`, the separator cannot be type `NVARCHAR`. 

Null values are ignored and the corresponding separator is not added. To return a place holder for null values, use the `ISNULL` function as demonstrated in example B.

`STRING_AGG` is available in any compatibility level.

> [!Note]
> `<order_clause>` is available with database compatibility level 110 and above.

## Examples

Most of the examples in this article reference the [AdventureWorks sample databases](../../samples/adventureworks-install-configure.md).

### A. Generate list of names separated in new lines

The following example produces a list of names in a single result cell, separated with carriage returns.
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
SELECT STRING_AGG (CONVERT(NVARCHAR(max),FirstName), CHAR(13)) AS csv 
FROM Person.Person;
GO
```
[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

|csv | 
|--- |
|Syed <br />Catherine <br />Kim <br />Kim <br />Kim <br />Hazem <br />... | 

`NULL` values found in `name` cells aren't returned in the result.   

> [!NOTE]  
> If using the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Query Editor, the **Results to Grid** option cannot implement the carriage return. Switch to **Results to Text** to see the result set properly.       
> Results to Text are truncated to 256 characters by default. To increase this limit, change the **Maximum number of characters displayed in each column** option.

### B. Generate list of names separated with comma without NULL values

The following example replaces null values with 'N/A' and returns the names separated by commas in a single result cell.  
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
SELECT STRING_AGG(CONVERT(NVARCHAR(max), ISNULL(FirstName,'N/A')), ',') AS csv 
FROM Person.Person;
GO
```

[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Results are shown trimmed.

|csv | 
|--- |
|Syed,Catherine,Kim,Kim,Kim,Hazem,Sam,Humberto,Gustavo,Pilar,Pilar, ...|  

### C. Generate comma-separated values

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
SELECT STRING_AGG(CONVERT(NVARCHAR(max), CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName, '(', ModifiedDate, ')')), CHAR(13)) AS names 
FROM Person.Person;
GO
```
[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Results are shown trimmed.

|names |
|--- |
|Ken SÃ¡nchez (Feb  8 2003 12:00AM) <br />Terri Duffy (Feb 24 2002 12:00AM) <br />Roberto Tamburello (Dec  5 2001 12:00AM) <br />Rob Walters (Dec 29 2001 12:00AM) <br />... |

> [!NOTE]  
> If using the Management Studio Query Editor, the **Results to Grid** option cannot implement the carriage return. Switch to **Results to Text** to see the result set properly.

### D. Return news articles with related tags

Imagine a database where articles and their tags are separated into different tables. A developer wants to return one row per each article with all associated tags. The following query achieves this result:

```sql
SELECT a.articleId, title, STRING_AGG (tag, ',') as tags
FROM dbo.Article AS a
LEFT JOIN dbo.ArticleTag AS t
    ON a.ArticleId = t.ArticleId
GROUP BY a.articleId, title;
GO
```

[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

|articleId |title |tags |
|--- |--- |--- |
|172 |Polls indicate close election results |politics,polls,city council |
|176 |New highway expected to reduce congestion |NULL |
|177 |Dogs continue to be more popular than cats |polls,animals|

> [!NOTE]
> The `GROUP BY` clause is required if the `STRING_AGG` function isn't the only item in the `SELECT` list.

### E. Generate list of emails per towns

The following query finds the email addresses of employees and groups them by city:

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

SELECT TOP 10 City, STRING_AGG(CONVERT(NVARCHAR(max), EmailAddress), ';') AS emails 
FROM Person.BusinessEntityAddress AS BEA  
INNER JOIN Person.Address AS A ON BEA.AddressID = A.AddressID
INNER JOIN Person.EmailAddress AS EA ON BEA.BusinessEntityID = EA.BusinessEntityID 
GROUP BY City;
GO
```

[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Results are shown trimmed.

|City |emails |
|--- |--- |
|Ballard|paige28@adventure-works.com;joshua24@adventure-works.com;javier12@adventure-works.com;...|
|Baltimore|gilbert9@adventure-works.com|
|Barstow|kristen4@adventure-works.com|
|Basingstoke Hants|dale10@adventure-works.com;heidi9@adventure-works.com|
|Baytown|kelvin15@adventure-works.com|
|Beaverton|billy6@adventure-works.com;dalton35@adventure-works.com;lawrence1@adventure-works.com;...|
|Bell Gardens|christy8@adventure-works.com
|Bellevue|min0@adventure-works.com;gigi0@adventure-works.com;terry18@adventure-works.com;...|
|Bellflower|philip0@adventure-works.com;emma34@adventure-works.com;jorge8@adventure-works.com;...|
|Bellingham|christopher23@adventure-works.com;frederick7@adventure-works.com;omar0@adventure-works.com;...|

Emails returned in the emails column can be directly used to send emails to group of people working in some particular cities. 

### F. Generate a sorted list of emails per towns   
Similar to the previous example, the following query finds the email addresses of employees, groups them by city, and sorts the emails alphabetically:

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

SELECT TOP 10 City, STRING_AGG(CONVERT(NVARCHAR(max), EmailAddress), ';') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY EmailAddress ASC) AS Emails 
FROM Person.BusinessEntityAddress AS BEA  
INNER JOIN Person.Address AS A ON BEA.AddressID = A.AddressID
INNER JOIN Person.EmailAddress AS EA ON BEA.BusinessEntityID = EA.BusinessEntityID 
GROUP BY City;
GO
```

[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Results are shown trimmed.
