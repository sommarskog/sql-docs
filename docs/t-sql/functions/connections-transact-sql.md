# &#x40;&#x40;CONNECTIONS (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

This function returns the number of attempted connections - both successful and unsuccessful - since [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] was last started.

## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
@@CONNECTIONS  
```  

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return types
**integer**
  
## Remarks  
Connections are different from users. An application, for example, can open multiple connections to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] without user observation of those connections.
  
Run **sp_monitor** for a report containing several [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] statistics, including count of connection attempts.
  
@@MAX_CONNECTIONS is the maximum allowed number of simultaneous connections to the server. @@CONNECTIONS increments with each login attempt; therefore, @@CONNECTIONS can exceed @@MAX_CONNECTIONS.
  
## Examples  
This example returns the count of login attempts as of the current date and time.
  
```sql
SELECT GETDATE() AS 'Today''s Date and Time',   
@@CONNECTIONS AS 'Login Attempts';  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]
  
``` 
Today's Date and Time  Login Attempts
