# TYPE_NAME (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  Returns the unqualified type name of a specified type ID.  
  
 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
TYPE_NAME ( type_id )   
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *type_id*  
 Is the ID of the type that will be used. *type_id* is an **int**, and it can refer to a type in any schema that the caller has permission to access.  
  
## Return Types  
 **sysname**  
  
## Exceptions  
 Returns NULL on error or if a caller does not have permission to view the object.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], a user can only view the metadata of securables that the user owns or on which the user has been granted permission. This means that metadata-emitting, built-in functions such as TYPE_NAME may return NULL if the user does not have any permission on the object. For more information, see [Metadata Visibility Configuration](../../relational-databases/security/metadata-visibility-configuration.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 TYPE_NAME will return NULL when *type_id* is not valid or when the caller does not have sufficient permission to reference the type.  
  
 TYPE_NAME works for system data types and also for user-defined data types. The type can be contained in any schema, but an unqualified type name is always returned. This means the name does not have the _schema_**.** prefix.  
  
 System functions can be used in the select list, in the WHERE clause, and anywhere an expression is allowed. For more information, see [Expressions &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) and [WHERE &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/where-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Examples  
 The following example returns the object name, column name, and type name for each column in the `Vendor` table of the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql
SELECT o.name AS obj_name, c.name AS col_name,  
       TYPE_NAME(c.user_type_id) AS type_name  
FROM sys.objects AS o   
JOIN sys.columns AS c  ON o.object_id = c.object_id  
WHERE o.name = 'Vendor'  
ORDER BY col_name;  
GO  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 ```
obj_name        col_name                  type_name
--------------- ------------------------ --------------
Vendor          AccountNumber            AccountNumber
Vendor          ActiveFlag               Flag
Vendor          BusinessEntityID         int
Vendor          CreditRating             tinyint
Vendor          ModifiedDate             datetime
Vendor          Name                     Name
Vendor          PreferredVendorStatus    Flag
Vendor          PurchasingWebServiceURL  nvarchar

(8 row(s) affected)
```  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
 The following example returns the `TYPE ID` for the data type with id `1`.  
  
```sql
SELECT TYPE_NAME(36) AS Type36, TYPE_NAME(239) AS Type239;  
GO  
```  
  
 For a list of types, query sys.types.  
  
```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.types;  
GO  
```
