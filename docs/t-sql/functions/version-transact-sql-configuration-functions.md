# @@VERSION - Transact SQL Configuration Functions
[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The [!INCLUDE[ssDE-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] version numbers for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] are not comparable with each other, and represent internal build numbers for these separate products. The [!INCLUDE[ssDE-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] for [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] is based on the same code base as the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]. Most importantly, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] always has the newest SQL [!INCLUDE[ssDE-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] bits. For example, version 12 of [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] is newer than version 16 of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
@@VERSION  
```  

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return Types
 **nvarchar**  
  
## Remarks  
 The @@VERSION results are presented as one nvarchar string. You can use the [SERVERPROPERTY &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/functions/serverproperty-transact-sql.md) function to retrieve the individual property values.  
  
 For [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the following information is returned.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] version  
  
-   Processor architecture  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] build date  
  
-   Copyright statement

-   Operating system version  
  
 For [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] and [!INCLUDE [sssdsmifull-md](../../includes/sssdsmifull-md.md)], the following information is returned.

```  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]
