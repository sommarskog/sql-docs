## SQL Server

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
-- Syntax for SQL Server

ALTER USER userName
 WITH <set_item> [ ,...n ]
[;]

<set_item> ::=
NAME = newUserName
| DEFAULT_SCHEMA = { schemaName | NULL }
| LOGIN = loginName
| PASSWORD = 'password' [ OLD_PASSWORD = 'oldpassword' ]
| DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = { NONE | <lcid> | <language name> | <language alias> }
| ALLOW_ENCRYPTED_VALUE_MODIFICATIONS = [ ON | OFF ]
```

## Arguments

 *userName*
 Specifies the name by which the user is identified inside this database.

 LOGIN **=** _loginName_
 Remaps a user to another login by changing the user's Security Identifier (SID) to match the login's SID.

 NAME **=** _newUserName_
 Specifies the new name for this user. *newUserName* must not already occur in the current database.

 DEFAULT_SCHEMA **=** { *schemaName* | NULL }
 Specifies the first schema that will be searched by the server when it resolves the names of objects for this user. Setting the default schema to NULL removes a default schema from a Windows group. The NULL option cannot be used with a Windows user.

 PASSWORD **=** '*password*'
 **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later, [!INCLUDE[sqldbesa](../../includes/sqldbesa-md.md)].

 Specifies the password for the user that is being changed. Passwords are case-sensitive.

> [!NOTE]
> This option is available only for contained users. For more information, see [Contained Databases](../../relational-databases/databases/contained-databases.md) and [sp_migrate_user_to_contained &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-migrate-user-to-contained-transact-sql.md).

 OLD_PASSWORD **=**_'oldpassword'_
 **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later, [!INCLUDE[sqldbesa](../../includes/sqldbesa-md.md)].

 The current user password that will be replaced by '*password*'. Passwords are case-sensitive. *OLD_PASSWORD* is required to change a password, unless you have **ALTER ANY USER** permission. Requiring *OLD_PASSWORD* prevents users with **IMPERSONATION** permission from changing the password.

> [!NOTE]
> This option is available only for contained users.

 DEFAULT_LANGUAGE **=**_{ NONE \| \<lcid> \| \<language name> \| \<language alias> }_
 **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.

 Specifies a default language to be assigned to the user. If this option is set to NONE, the default language is set to the current default language of the database. If the default language of the database is later changed, the default language of the user will remain unchanged. *DEFAULT_LANGUAGE* can be the local ID (lcid), the name of the language, or the language alias.

> [!NOTE]
> This option may only be specified in a contained database and only for contained users.

 ALLOW_ENCRYPTED_VALUE_MODIFICATIONS = [ ON | **OFF** ]
 **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and later, [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../includes/sssds-md.md)].

 Suppresses cryptographic metadata checks on the server in bulk copy operations. This enables the user to bulk copy encrypted data between tables or databases, without decrypting the data. The default is OFF.

> [!WARNING]
> Improper use of this option can lead to data corruption. For more information, see [Migrate Sensitive Data Protected by Always Encrypted](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/migrate-sensitive-data-protected-by-always-encrypted.md).

## Remarks

 The default schema will be the first schema that will be searched by the server when it resolves the names of objects for this database user. Unless otherwise specified, the default schema will be the owner of objects created by this database user.

 If the user has a default schema, that default schema will be used. If the user doesn't have a default schema, but the user is a member of a group that has a default schema, the default schema of the group will be used. If the user doesn't have a default schema, and is a member of more than one group, the default schema for the user will be that of the Windows group with the lowest principal_id and an explicitly set default schema. If no default schema can be determined for a user, the **dbo** schema will be used.

 DEFAULT_SCHEMA can be set to a schema that doesn't currently occur in the database. Therefore, you can assign a DEFAULT_SCHEMA to a user before that schema is created.

 DEFAULT_SCHEMA can't be specified for a user who is mapped to a certificate, or an asymmetric key.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The value of DEFAULT_SCHEMA is ignored if the user is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role. All members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role have a default schema of `dbo`.

 You can change the name of a user who is mapped to a Windows login or group only when the SID of the new user name matches the SID that is recorded in the database. This check helps prevent spoofing of Windows logins in the database.

 The WITH LOGIN clause enables the remapping of a user to a different login. Users without a login, users mapped to a certificate, or users mapped to an asymmetric key can't be remapped with this clause. Only SQL users and Windows users (or groups) can be remapped. The WITH LOGIN clause can't be used to change the type of user, such as changing a Windows account to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login.
 
 A mismatched SID can occur when you have restored a database from another server and have a database user mapped to a SQL Server login. You can use the WITH LOGIN clause to correct this situation by replacing the user SID in the database with the login SID from the server.

 The name of the user will be automatically renamed to the login name if the following conditions are true.

- The user is a Windows user.

- The name is a Windows name (contains a backslash).

- No new name was specified.

- The current name differs from the login name.

 Otherwise, the user won't be renamed unless the caller additionally invokes the NAME clause.

The name of a user mapped to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login, a certificate, or an asymmetric key can't contain the backslash character (\\).

> [!CAUTION]
> [!INCLUDE[ssCautionUserSchema](../../includes/sscautionuserschema-md.md)]

## Security

> [!NOTE]
> A user who has **ALTER ANY USER** permission can change the default schema of any user. A user who has an altered schema might unknowingly select data from the wrong table or execute code from the wrong schema.

### Permissions

 To change the name of a user requires the **ALTER ANY USER** permission.

 To change the target login of a user requires the **CONTROL** permission on the database.

 To change the user name of a user having **CONTROL** permission on the database requires the **CONTROL** permission on the database.

 To change the default schema or language requires **ALTER** permission on the user. Users can change their own default schema or language.

## Examples

All examples are executed in a user database.

### A. Changing the name of a database user

 The following example changes the name of the database user `Mary5` to `Mary51`.

```sql
ALTER USER Mary5 WITH NAME = Mary51;
GO
```

### B. Changing the default schema of a user

 The following example changes the default schema of the user `Mary51` to `Purchasing`.

```sql
ALTER USER Mary51 WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = Purchasing;
GO
```

### C. Changing several options at once

 The following example changes several options for a contained database user in one statement.

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.

```sql
ALTER USER Philip
WITH NAME = Philipe
, DEFAULT_SCHEMA = Development
, PASSWORD = 'W1r77TT98%ab@#' OLD_PASSWORD = 'New Devel0per'
, DEFAULT_LANGUAGE= French ;
GO
```

### D. Correct a mismatched SID 

 The following example corrects the user SID in the database to match the SID on the server for a SQL Server authenticated login.
 
```sql
ALTER USER Mai
WITH LOGIN = Mai;
GO
```

## SQL Database

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
-- Syntax for Azure SQL Database

ALTER USER userName
 WITH <set_item> [ ,...n ]

<set_item> ::=
NAME = newUserName
| DEFAULT_SCHEMA = schemaName
| LOGIN = loginName
| ALLOW_ENCRYPTED_VALUE_MODIFICATIONS = [ ON | OFF ]

## Azure SQL Managed Instance

## Syntax

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only the following options are supported for Azure SQL Managed Instance when applying to users with Azure AD logins:
> `DEFAULT_SCHEMA = { schemaName | NULL }` and
> `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = { NONE | lcid | language name | language alias }`
> </br> </br> There is a new syntax extension that was added to help remap users in a database that was migrated to Azure SQL Managed Instance. The ALTER USER syntax helps map database users in a federated and synchronized domain with Azure AD, to Azure AD logins.

```syntaxsql
-- Syntax for SQL Managed Instance
ALTER USER userName
 { WITH <set_item> [ ,...n ] | FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER }
[;]

<set_item> ::=
NAME = newUserName
| DEFAULT_SCHEMA = { schemaName | NULL }
| LOGIN = loginName
| PASSWORD = 'password' [ OLD_PASSWORD = 'oldpassword' ]
| DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = { NONE | <lcid> | <language name> | <language alias> }
| ALLOW_ENCRYPTED_VALUE_MODIFICATIONS = [ ON | OFF ]

-- Users or groups that are migrated as federated and synchronized with Azure AD have the following syntax:

/** Applies to Windows users that were migrated and have the following user names:
- Windows user <domain\user>
- Windows group <domain\MyWindowsGroup>
- Windows alias <MyWindowsAlias>
**/

ALTER USER userName
 { WITH <set_item> [ ,...n ] | FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER }

 NAME = newUserName
| DEFAULT_SCHEMA = { schemaName | NULL }
| LOGIN = loginName
| DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = { NONE | <lcid> | <language name> | <language alias> }
```

## Arguments

 *userName*
 Specifies the name by which the user is identified inside this database.

 LOGIN **=** _loginName_
 Remaps a user to another login by changing the user's Security Identifier (SID) to match the login's SID.

 If the ALTER USER statement is the only statement in a SQL batch, Azure SQL Database supports the WITH LOGIN clause. If the ALTER USER statement isn't the only statement in a SQL batch or is executed in dynamic SQL, the WITH LOGIN clause isn't supported.

 NAME **=** _newUserName_

 OLD_PASSWORD **=** _'oldpassword'_

 The current user password that will be replaced by '*password*'. Passwords are case-sensitive. *OLD_PASSWORD* is required to change a password, unless you have **ALTER ANY USER** permission. Requiring *OLD_PASSWORD* prevents users with **IMPERSONATION** permission from changing the password.

> [!NOTE]
> This option is available only for contained users.

 DEFAULT_LANGUAGE **=**_{ NONE | \<lcid> | \<language name> | \<language alias> }_

 Specifies a default language to be assigned to the user. If this option is set to NONE, the default language is set to the current default language of the database. If the default language of the database is later changed, the default language of the user will remain unchanged. *DEFAULT_LANGUAGE* can be the local ID (lcid), the name of the language, or the language alias.

> [!NOTE]
> This option may only be specified in a contained database and only for contained users.

 ALLOW_ENCRYPTED_VALUE_MODIFICATIONS = [ ON | **OFF** ]

 Suppresses cryptographic metadata checks on the server in bulk copy operations. This enables the user to bulk copy encrypted data between tables or databases, without decrypting the data. The default is OFF.

> [!WARNING]
> Improper use of this option can lead to data corruption. For more information, see [Migrate Sensitive Data Protected by Always Encrypted](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/migrate-sensitive-data-protected-by-always-encrypted.md).

The WITH LOGIN clause can't be used to change the type of user, such as changing a Windows account to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login. The only exception is when changing a Windows user to an Azure AD user.

> [!NOTE]
> The following rules do not apply to Windows users on Azure SQL Managed Instance as we do not support creating Windows logins on Azure SQL Managed Instance. The WITH LOGIN option can only be used if Azure AD logins are present.

 The name of the user will be automatically renamed to the login name if the following conditions are true.

- The user is a Windows user.

- The name is a Windows name (contains a backslash).

- No new name was specified.

- The current name differs from the login name.

 Otherwise, the user won't be renamed unless the caller additionally invokes the NAME clause.

The name of a user mapped to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login, a certificate, or an asymmetric key can't contain the backslash character (\\).

These remarks apply to authenticating as Windows users that have been federated and synchronized with Azure AD.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure AD admin for Azure SQL Managed Instance functionality after creation has changed. For more information, see [New Azure AD admin functionality for MI](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-aad-authentication-configure#new-azure-ad-admin-functionality-for-mi).

- Validation of Windows users or groups that are mapped to Azure AD is done by default through Graph API in all versions of the ALTER USER syntax used for migration purpose.
- On-premises users that were aliased (use a different name from the original Windows account) will keep the aliased name.
- For Azure AD authentication, the LOGIN parameter applies only to Azure SQL Managed Instance and can't be used with SQL Database.
- To view logins for Azure AD Principals, use the following command:
`select * from sys.server_principals`.
- Check the login's indicated type is `E` or `X`.
- PASSWORD option can't be used for Azure AD users.
- In all migration cases, the roles and permissions of Windows users or groups will automatically be transferred to the new Azure AD users or groups.
- A new syntax extension, **FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER** is available for altering Windows users and groups from SQL on-premises to Azure AD users and groups. The Windows domain must be federated with Azure AD and all Windows domain members must exist in Azure AD when using this extension. The **FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER** syntax applies to Azure SQL Managed Instance and should be used in case Windows users do not have logins on the original SQL instance and need to be mapped to standalone Azure AD database users.
- In this case, the allowable userName can be:
- A Widows user (_domain\user_).
- A Windows group (_MyWidnowsGroup_).
- A Windows alias (_MyWindowsAlias_).
- The outcome of the ALTER command replaces the old userName with the corresponding name that is found in Azure AD based on the original SID of the old userName. The altered name is replaced and stored in the metadata of the database:
- (_domain\user_) will be replaced with Azure AD user@domain.com.
- (_domain\\MyWidnowsGroup_) will be replaced with Azure AD group.
- (_MyWindowsAlias_) will remain unchanged but the SID of this user will be checked in Azure AD.

> [!NOTE]
> If the SID of the original user converted to objectID cannot be found in Azure AD, the ALTER USER command will fail.

- To view altered users, use the following command: 
`select * from sys.database_principals`
- Check the user's indicated type `E` or `X`.
- When NAME is used to migrate Windows users to Azure AD users, the following restrictions apply:
- A valid LOGIN must be specified.
- The NAME will be checked in Azure AD and can only be:
- The name of the LOGIN.
- An alias - the name can't exist in Azure AD.
- In all other cases, the syntax will fail.

## Security

> [!NOTE]
> A user who has **ALTER ANY USER** permission can change the default schema of any user. A user who has an altered schema might unknowingly select data from the wrong table or execute code from the wrong schema.

### Permissions

 To change the name of a user requires the **ALTER ANY USER** permission.

 To change the target login of a user requires the **CONTROL** permission on the database.

 To change the user name of a user having **CONTROL** permission on the database requires the **CONTROL** permission on the database.

 To change the default schema or language requires **ALTER** permission on the user. Users can change their own default schema or language.

## Examples

All examples are executed in a user database.

### A. Changing the name of a database user

 The following example changes the name of the database user `Mary5` to `Mary51`.

```sql
ALTER USER Mary5 WITH NAME = Mary51;
GO
```

### B. Changing the default schema of a user

 The following example changes the default schema of the user `Mary51` to `Purchasing`.

```sql
ALTER USER Mary51 WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = Purchasing;
GO
```

### C. Changing several options at once

 The following example changes several options for a contained database user in one statement.

```sql
ALTER USER Philip
WITH NAME = Philipe
, DEFAULT_SCHEMA = Development
, PASSWORD = 'W1r77TT98%ab@#' OLD_PASSWORD = 'New Devel0per'
, DEFAULT_LANGUAGE= French ;
GO
```

### D. Map the user in the database to an Azure AD login after migration

The following example remaps the user, `westus/joe` to an Azure AD user, `joe@westus.com`. This example is for logins that already exist in the managed instance. This needs to be performed after you have completed a database migration to Azure SQL Managed Instance, and want to use the Azure AD login to authenticate.

```sql
ALTER USER [westus/joe] WITH LOGIN = joe@westus.com
```

### E. Map an old Windows user in the database without a login in Azure SQL Managed Instance to an Azure AD user

The following example remaps the user, `westus/joe` without a login, to an Azure AD user, `joe@westus.com`. The federated user must exist in Azure AD.

```sql
ALTER USER [westus/joe] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER
```

### F. Map the user alias to an existing Azure AD login

The following example remaps the user name, `westus\joe` to `joe_alias`. The corresponding Azure AD login in this case is `joe@westus.com`.

```sql
ALTER USER [westus/joe] WITH LOGIN = joe@westus.com, name= joe_alias
```

### G. Map a Windows group that was migrated in Azure SQL Managed Instance to an Azure AD group

The following example remaps the old on-premises group, `westus\mygroup` to an Azure AD group `mygroup` in the managed instance. The group must exist in Azure AD.

```sql
ALTER USER [westus\mygroup] WITH LOGIN = mygroup
```

## Azure Synapse Analytics

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
-- Syntax for Azure Synapse

ALTER USER userName
 WITH <set_item> [ ,...n ]

<set_item> ::=
 NAME = newUserName
 | LOGIN = loginName
 | DEFAULT_SCHEMA = schema_name
[;]
```

## Arguments

 *userName*
 Specifies the name by which the user is identified inside this database.

 LOGIN **=** _loginName_
 Remaps a user to another login by changing the user's Security Identifier (SID) to match the login's SID.

 If the ALTER USER statement is the only statement in a SQL batch, Azure SQL Database supports the WITH LOGIN clause. If the ALTER USER statement isn't the only statement in a SQL batch or is executed in dynamic SQL, the WITH LOGIN clause isn't supported.

 NAME **=** _newUserName_
 Specifies the new name for this user. *newUserName* must not already occur in the current database.

 DEFAULT_SCHEMA **=** { *schemaName* | NULL }
 Specifies the first schema that will be searched by the server when it resolves the names of objects for this user. Setting the default schema to NULL removes a default schema from a Windows group. The NULL option can't be used with a Windows user.

## Remarks

 The default schema will be the first schema that will be searched by the server when it resolves the names of objects for this database user. Unless otherwise specified, the default schema will be the owner of objects created by this database user.

 If the user has a default schema, that default schema will used. If the user doesn't have a default schema, but the user is a member of a group that has a default schema, the default schema of the group will be used. If the user doesn't have a default schema, and is a member of more than one group, the default schema for the user will be that of the Windows group with the lowest principal_id and an explicitly set default schema. If no default schema can be determined for a user, the **dbo** schema will be used.

 DEFAULT_SCHEMA can be set to a schema that doesn't currently occur in the database. Therefore, you can assign a DEFAULT_SCHEMA to a user before that schema is created.

 DEFAULT_SCHEMA can't be specified for a user who is mapped to a certificate, or an asymmetric key.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The value of DEFAULT_SCHEMA is ignored if the user is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role. All members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role have a default schema of `dbo`.

 The WITH LOGIN clause enables the remapping of a user to a different login. Users without a login, users mapped to a certificate, or users mapped to an asymmetric key can't be remapped with this clause. Only SQL users and Windows users (or groups) can be remapped. The WITH LOGIN clause can't be used to change the type of user, such as changing a Windows account to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login.

 The name of the user will be automatically renamed to the login name if the following conditions are true.

- No new name was specified.

- The current name differs from the login name.

 Otherwise, the user won't be renamed unless the caller additionally invokes the NAME clause.

The name of a user mapped to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login, a certificate, or an asymmetric key can't contain the backslash character (\\).

 To change the user name of a user having **CONTROL** permission on the database requires the **CONTROL** permission on the database.

 To change the default schema or language requires **ALTER** permission on the user. Users can change their own default schema or language.

### B. Changing the default schema of a user

The following example changes the default schema of the user `Mary51` to `Purchasing`.

```sql
ALTER USER Mary51 WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = Purchasing;
GO
