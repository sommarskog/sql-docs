# BACKUP SYMMETRIC KEY (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2022-asdb-asmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2022-asdb-asmi.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] introduces support for exporting and importing symmetric keys, either to or from Azure Blob storage or file.

Exports the symmetric key.

## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
BACKUP SYMMETRIC KEY key_name TO 
  {
    FILE = 'path_to_file'
  | URL = 'Azure Blob storage URL'
  }
      ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'password'  
```

## Arguments

 FILE **='***path_to_file***'**  
 Specifies the complete path, including file name, to the file to which the symmetric key will be exported. The path may be a local path or a UNC path to a network location.  
  
 URL **='***Azure Blob storage URL***'**
 Is the URL for your Azure Blob storage, in the format similar to `https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<storage_container_name>/<backup_file_name>.bak`.

 ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD **='***password***'**  
 Is the password used to encrypt the symmetric key in the backup file. This password is subject to complexity checks. For more information, see [Password Policy](../../relational-databases/security/password-policy.md).  
  
## Prerequisite

In order to back up the symmetric key to an Azure Blob storage, you need to:

1. Have an [Azure storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).
1. [Create stored access policy and shared access storage](../../relational-databases/tutorial-use-azure-blob-storage-service-with-sql-server-2016.md#1---create-stored-access-policy-and-shared-access-storage).
1. [Create a SQL Server credential using a shared access signature](../../relational-databases/tutorial-use-azure-blob-storage-service-with-sql-server-2016.md#2---create-a-sql-server-credential-using-a-shared-access-signature).

For more information, see [Tutorial: Use Azure Blob Storage with SQL Server](../../relational-databases/tutorial-use-azure-blob-storage-service-with-sql-server-2016.md).

## Permissions

Requires ALTER permission on the symmetric key. If adding encryption by a certificate or asymmetric key, requires VIEW DEFINITION permission on the certificate or asymmetric key. If dropping encryption by a certificate or asymmetric key, requires CONTROL permission on the certificate or asymmetric key.
  
## Examples

In the following example, the symmetric key is backed up to a file.

```sql  
BACKUP SYMMETRIC KEY symmetric_key
   TO FILE = 'c:\temp_backups\keys\symmetric_key' 
   ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '3dH85Hhk003GHk2597gheij4';  
```

In the following example, the symmetric key is backed up to an Azure Blob storage.

```sql
BACKUP SYMMETRIC KEY symmetric_key 
   TO URL = 'https://mydocsteststorage.blob.core.windows.net/mytestcontainer/symmetric_key.bak'
   ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '3dH85Hhk003GHk2597gheij4'
```
