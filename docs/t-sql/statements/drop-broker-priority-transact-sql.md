## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
DROP BROKER PRIORITY ConversationPriorityName  
[;]  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *ConversationPriorityName*  
 Specifies the name of the conversation priority to be removed.  
  
## Remarks  
 When you drop a conversation priority, any existing conversations continue to operate with the priority levels they were assigned from the conversation priority.  
  
## Permissions  
 Permission for creating a conversation priority defaults to members of the db_ddladmin or db_owner fixed database roles, and to the sysadmin fixed server role. Requires ALTER permission on the database.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example drops the conversation priority named `InitiatorAToTargetPriority`.  
  
```sql  
DROP BROKER PRIORITY InitiatorAToTargetPriority;
```
