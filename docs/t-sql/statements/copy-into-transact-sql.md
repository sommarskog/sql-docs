# COPY INTO (Transact-SQL)

::: moniker range="=azure-sqldw-latest"

[!INCLUDE [asa](../../includes/applies-to-version/asa.md)]

This article explains how to use the COPY statement in [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] for loading from external storage accounts. The COPY statement provides the most flexibility for high-throughput data ingestion into [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> For [!INCLUDE [fabricdw](../../includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)], visit [COPY INTO](copy-into-transact-sql.md?view=fabric&preserve-view=true).

Use COPY for the following capabilities:

- Use lower privileged users to load without needing strict CONTROL permissions on the data warehouse
- Execute a single T-SQL statement without having to create any other database objects
- Properly parse and load CSV files where *delimiters* (string, field, row) are escaped *within* string delimited columns
- Specify a finer permission model without exposing storage account keys using Share Access Signatures (SAS)
- Use a different storage account for the ERRORFILE location (REJECTED_ROW_LOCATION)
- Customize default values for each target column and specify source data fields to load into specific target columns
- Specify a custom row terminator for CSV files
- Use SQL Server Date formats for CSV files
- Specify wildcards and multiple files in the storage location path
- Automatic schema discovery simplifies the process of defining and mapping source data into target tables
- The automatic table creation process automatically creates the tables and works alongside with automatic schema discovery

Visit the following documentation for comprehensive examples and quickstarts using the COPY statement:

- [Quickstart: Bulk load data using the COPY statement](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/quickstart-bulk-load-copy-tsql)
- [Quickstart: Examples using the COPY statement and its supported authentication methods](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/quickstart-bulk-load-copy-tsql-examples)

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
COPY INTO [ schema. ] table_name
[ (Column_list) ]
FROM '<external_location>' [ , ...n ]
WITH
 (
 [ FILE_TYPE = { 'CSV' | 'PARQUET' | 'ORC' } ]
 [ , FILE_FORMAT = EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT OBJECT ]
 [ , CREDENTIAL = (AZURE CREDENTIAL) ]
 [ , ERRORFILE = ' [ http(s)://storageaccount/container ] /errorfile_directory [ / ] ] '
 [ , ERRORFILE_CREDENTIAL = (AZURE CREDENTIAL) ]
 [ , MAXERRORS = max_errors ]
 [ , COMPRESSION = { 'Gzip' | 'DefaultCodec' | 'Snappy' } ]
 [ , FIELDQUOTE = 'string_delimiter' ]
 [ , FIELDTERMINATOR =  'field_terminator' ]
 [ , ROWTERMINATOR = 'row_terminator' ]
 [ , FIRSTROW = first_row ]
 [ , DATEFORMAT = 'date_format' ]
 [ , ENCODING = { 'UTF8' | 'UTF16' } ]
 [ , IDENTITY_INSERT = { 'ON' | 'OFF' } ]
 [ , AUTO_CREATE_TABLE = { 'ON' | 'OFF' } ]
)
```

## Arguments

#### *schema_name*

Optional if the default schema for the user performing the operation is the schema of the specified table. If *schema* isn't specified, and the default schema of the user performing the COPY operation is different from the specified table, COPY is canceled, and an error message is returned.

#### *table_name*

The name of the table to COPY data into. The target table can be a temporary or permanent table and must already exist in the database. For automatic schema detection mode, don't provide a column list.

#### *(column_list)*

An optional list of one or more columns used to map source data fields to target table columns for loading data.

Don't specify a *column_list* when `AUTO_CREATE_TABLE = 'ON'`.

*column_list* must be enclosed in parentheses and delimited by commas. The column list is of the following format:

[(Column_name [default Default_value] [Field_number] [,...n])]

- *Column_name* - the name of the column in the target table.
- *Default_value* - the default value that replaces any NULL value in the input file. Default value applies to all file formats. COPY attempts to load NULL from the input file when a column is omitted from the column list or when there's an empty input file field. Default value precedes the keyword 'default'
- *Field_number* - the input file field number that is mapped to the target column name.
- The field indexing starts at 1.

When a column list isn't specified, COPY maps columns based on the source and target order: Input field 1 goes to target column 1, field 2 goes to column 2, etc.

#### *External locations*

Is where the files containing the data is staged. Currently Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 and Azure Blob Storage are supported:

- *External location* for Blob Storage: `https://<account\>.blob.core.windows.net/<container\>/<path\>`
- *External location* for ADLS Gen2: `https://<account\>.dfs.core.windows.net/<container\>/<path\>`

> [!NOTE]  
> The .blob endpoint is available for ADLS Gen2 as well and currently yields the best performance. Use the .blob endpoint when .dfs is not required for your authentication method.

- *Account* - The storage account name

- *Container* - The blob container name

- *Path* - the folder or file path for the data. The location starts from the container. If a folder is specified, COPY retrieves all files from the folder and all its subfolders. COPY ignores hidden folders and doesn't return files that begin with an underline (`_`) or a period (`.`) unless explicitly specified in the path. This behavior is the same even when specifying a path with a wildcard.

Wildcards cards can be included in the path where

- Wildcard path name matching is case-sensitive
- Wildcard can be escaped using the backslash character (`\`)
- Wildcard expansion is applied recursively. For instance, all CSV files under Customer1 (including subdirectories of Customer1) are loaded in the following example: `Account/Container/Customer1/*.csv`

> [!NOTE]  
> For best performance, avoid specifying wildcards that would expand over a larger number of files. If possible, list multiple file locations instead of specifying wildcards.

Multiple file locations can only be specified from the same storage account and container via a comma-separated list such as:

- `https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container\>/<path\>`, `https://<account\>.blob.core.windows.net/<container\>/<path\>`

#### *FILE_TYPE = { 'CSV' | 'PARQUET' | 'ORC' }*

*FILE_TYPE* specifies the format of the external data.

- CSV: Specifies a comma-separated values file compliant to the [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) standard.
- PARQUET: Specifies a Parquet format.
- ORC: Specifies an Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) format.

> [!NOTE]  
> The file type 'Delimited Text' in PolyBase is replaced by the 'CSV' file format where the default comma delimiter can be configured via the FIELDTERMINATOR parameter.

#### *FILE_FORMAT = external_file_format_name*

*FILE_FORMAT* applies to Parquet and ORC files only and specifies the name of the external file format object that stores the file type and compression method for the external data. To create an external file format, use [CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT](create-external-file-format-transact-sql.md).

#### *CREDENTIAL (IDENTITY = '', SECRET = '')*

*CREDENTIAL* specifies the authentication mechanism to access the external storage account. Authentication methods are:

| | CSV | Parquet | ORC |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Azure Blob Storage** | SAS/MSI/SERVICE PRINCIPAL/KEY/AAD | SAS/KEY | SAS/KEY |
| **Azure Data Lake Gen2** | SAS/MSI/SERVICE PRINCIPAL/KEY/AAD | SAS (blob <sup>1</sup> )/MSI (dfs <sup>2</sup> )/SERVICE PRINCIPAL/KEY/AAD | SAS (blob <sup>1</sup> )/MSI (dfs <sup>2</sup> )/SERVICE PRINCIPAL/KEY/AAD |

1: The .blob endpoint (**.blob**.core.windows.net) in your external location path is required for this authentication method.

2: The .dfs endpoint (**.dfs**.core.windows.net) in your external location path is required for this authentication method.

> [!NOTE]  
>  
> - When authenticating using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or to a public storage account, CREDENTIAL does not need to be specified.  
> - If your storage account is associated with a VNet, you must authenticate using MSI (Managed Identity).

- Authenticating with Shared Access Signatures (SAS)

  - *IDENTITY: A constant with a value of 'Shared Access Signature'*
  - *SECRET: The* [*shared access signature*](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) *provides delegated access to resources in your storage account.*
  -  Minimum permissions required: READ and LIST

- Authenticating with [*Service Principals*](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-load-from-azure-data-lake-store#create-a-credential)

  - *IDENTITY: \<ClientID\>@<OAuth_2.0_Token_EndPoint>*
  - *SECRET: Azure AD Application Service Principal key*
  -  Minimum RBAC roles required: Storage blob data contributor, Storage blob data contributor, Storage blob data owner, or Storage blob data reader

- Authenticating with Storage account key

  - *IDENTITY: A constant with a value of 'Storage Account Key'*
  - *SECRET: Storage account key*

- Authenticating with [Managed Identity](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/load-data-from-azure-blob-storage-using-polybase#authenticate-using-managed-identities-to-load-optional) (VNet Service Endpoints)

  - *IDENTITY: A constant with a value of 'Managed Identity'*
  - Minimum RBAC roles required: Storage blob data contributor or Storage blob data owner for the Azure AD registered SQL Database server

- Authenticating with an Azure AD user

  - *CREDENTIAL isn't required*
  - Minimum RBAC roles required: Storage blob data contributor or Storage blob data owner for the Azure AD user

#### *ERRORFILE = Directory Location*

*ERRORFILE* only applies to CSV. Specifies the directory within the COPY statement where the rejected rows and the corresponding error file should be written. The full path from the storage account can be specified or the path relative to the container can be specified. If the specified path doesn't exist, one is created on your behalf. A child directory is created with the name "\_rejectedrows". The "\_" character ensures that the directory is escaped for other data processing unless explicitly named in the location parameter.

Within this directory, there's a folder created based on the time of load submission in the format YearMonthDay -HourMinuteSecond (Ex. 20180330-173205). In this folder, two types of files are written, the reason (Error) file and the data (Row) file each preappending with the queryID, distributionID, and a file guid. Because the data and the reason are in separate files, corresponding files have a matching prefix.

If ERRORFILE has the full path of the storage account defined, then the ERRORFILE_CREDENTIAL is used to connect to that storage. Otherwise, the value mentioned for CREDENTIAL is used.

#### *ERRORFILE_CREDENTIAL = (IDENTITY= '', SECRET = '')*

*ERRORFILE_CREDENTIAL* only applies to CSV files. Supported data source and authentication methods are:

- Azure Blob Storage  - SAS/SERVICE PRINCIPAL/KEY/AAD
- Azure Data Lake Gen2 -   SAS/MSI/SERVICE PRINCIPAL/KEY/AAD

- Authenticating with Shared Access Signatures (SAS)
  - *IDENTITY: A constant with a value of 'Shared Access Signature'*
  - *SECRET: The* [*shared access signature*](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) *provides delegated access to resources in your storage account.*
  - Minimum permissions required: READ, LIST, WRITE, CREATE, DELETE

- Authenticating with [*Service Principals*](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-load-from-azure-data-lake-store#create-a-credential)
  - *IDENTITY: \<ClientID\>@<OAuth_2.0_Token_EndPoint>*
  - *SECRET: Azure AD Application Service Principal key*
  - Minimum RBAC roles required: Storage blob data contributor or Storage blob data owner

> [!NOTE]  
> Use the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint **V1**

- Authenticating with Storage account key
  - *IDENTITY: A constant with a value of 'Storage Account Key'*
  - *SECRET: Storage account key*

- Authenticating with [Managed Identity](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/load-data-from-azure-blob-storage-using-polybase#authenticate-using-managed-identities-to-load-optional) (VNet Service Endpoints)
  - *IDENTITY: A constant with a value of 'Managed Identity'*
  - Minimum RBAC roles required: Storage blob data contributor or Storage blob data owner for the Azure AD registered SQL Database server

- Authenticating with an Azure AD user
  - *CREDENTIAL isn't required*
  - Minimum RBAC roles required: Storage blob data contributor or Storage blob data owner for the Azure AD user

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using the same storage account for your ERRORFILE and specifying the ERRORFILE path relative to the root of the container, you do not need to specify the ERROR_CREDENTIAL.

#### *MAXERRORS = max_errors*

*MAXERRORS* specifies the maximum number of reject rows allowed in the load before the COPY operation is canceled. Each row that can't be imported by the COPY operation is ignored and counted as one error. If max_errors isn't specified, the default is 0.

#### *COMPRESSION = { 'DefaultCodec ' | 'Snappy' | 'GZIP' | 'NONE'}*

*COMPRESSION* is optional and specifies the data compression method for the external data.

- CSV supports GZIP
- Parquet supports GZIP and Snappy
- ORC supports DefaultCodec and Snappy.
- Zlib is the default compression for ORC

The COPY command autodetects the compression type based on the file extension when this parameter isn't specified:

- .gz  - **GZIP**
- .snappy – **Snappy**
- .deflate - **DefaultCodec**  (Parquet and ORC only)

#### *FIELDQUOTE = 'field_quote'*

*FIELDQUOTE* applies to CSV and specifies a single character that is used as the quote character (string delimiter) in the CSV file. If not specified, the quote character (") is used as the quote character as defined in the RFC 4180 standard. Extended ASCII and multi-byte characters and aren't supported with UTF-8 for FIELDQUOTE.

> [!NOTE]  
> FIELDQUOTE characters are escaped in string columns where there is a presence of a double FIELDQUOTE (delimiter).

#### *FIELDTERMINATOR = 'field_terminator'*

*FIELDTERMINATOR* Only applies to CSV. Specifies the field terminator that is used in the CSV file. The field terminator can be specified using hexadecimal notation. The field terminator can be multi-character. The default field terminator is a (,). Extended ASCII and multi-byte characters and aren't supported with UTF-8 for FIELDTERMINATOR.

#### ROW TERMINATOR = 'row_terminator'

*ROW TERMINATOR* Only applies to CSV. Specifies the row terminator that is used in the CSV file. The row terminator can be specified using hexadecimal notation. The row terminator can be multi-character. By default, the row terminator is `\r\n`.

The COPY command prefixes the `\r` character when specifying `\n` (newline) resulting in `\r\n`. To specify only the `\n` character, use hexadecimal notation (`0x0A`). When specifying multi-character row terminators in hexadecimal, don't specify 0x between each character.

Extended ASCII and multi-byte characters and aren't supported with UTF-8 for ROW TERMINATOR.

#### *FIRSTROW = First_row_int*

*FIRSTROW* applies to CSV and specifies the row number that is read first in all files for the COPY command. Values start from 1, which is the default value. If the value is set to two, the first row in every file (header row) is skipped when the data is loaded. Rows are skipped based on the existence of row terminators.

#### *DATEFORMAT = { 'mdy' | 'dmy' | 'ymd' | 'ydm' | 'myd' | 'dym' }*

DATEFORMAT only applies to CSV and specifies the date format of the date mapping to SQL Server date formats. For an overview of all Transact-SQL date and time data types and functions, see [Date and Time Data Types and Functions (Transact-SQL)](../functions/date-and-time-data-types-and-functions-transact-sql.md). DATEFORMAT within the COPY command takes precedence over [DATEFORMAT configured at the session level](set-dateformat-transact-sql.md).

#### *ENCODING = 'UTF8' | 'UTF16'*

*ENCODING* only applies to CSV. Default is UTF8. Specifies the data encoding standard for the files loaded by the COPY command.

#### *IDENTITY_INSERT = 'ON' | 'OFF'*

IDENTITY_INSERT specifies whether the identity value or values in the imported data file are to be used for the identity column. If IDENTITY_INSERT is OFF (default), the identity values for this column are verified, but not imported. Azure Synapse Analytics automatically assigns unique values based on the seed and increment values specified during table creation. Note the following behavior with the COPY command:

- If IDENTITY_INSERT is OFF, and table has an identity column
  - A column list must be specified which doesn't map an input field to the identity column.
- If IDENTITY_INSERT is ON, and table has an identity column
  - If a column list is passed, it must map an input field to the identity column.
- Default value isn't supported for the IDENTITY COLUMN in the column list.
- IDENTITY_INSERT can only be set for one table at a time.

#### *AUTO_CREATE_TABLE = { 'ON' | 'OFF' }*

*AUTO_CREATE_TABLE* specifies if the table could be automatically created by working alongside with automatic schema discovery. It's available only for Parquet files.

- ON: Enables automatic table creation. The COPY INTO process creates a new table automatically by discovering the structure of the file to be loaded. Can also be used with preexisting tables to take advantage of automatic schema discovery of Parquet files.
- OFF: Automatic table creation isn't enabled. Default.

> [!NOTE]  
> The automatic table creation works alongside with automatic schema discovery. The automatic table creation is NOT enabled by default.

Don't load into hash distributed tables from Parquet files using COPY INTO with AUTO_CREATE_TABLE = 'ON'.

If Parquet files are to be loaded into hash distributed tables using COPY INTO, load it into a round robin staging table followed by INSERT ... SELECT from that table to the target hash distributed table.

### Permissions

The user executing the COPY command must have the following permissions:

- [ADMINISTER DATABASE BULK OPERATIONS](grant-database-permissions-transact-sql.md#remarks)
- [INSERT](grant-database-permissions-transact-sql.md#remarks)

Requires INSERT and ADMINISTER BULK OPERATIONS permissions. In [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)], INSERT, and ADMINISTER DATABASE BULK OPERATIONS permissions are required.

Additionally, if the user executing the COPY command also intends to generate a new table and load data into it, they require CREATE TABLE and ALTER ON SCHEMA permissions.

For example, to allow `mike@contoso.com` to use COPY to create a new table in the `HR` schema, and insert the data from a Parquet file, use the following Transact-SQL sample:

```sql
GRANT ADMINISTER DATABASE BULK OPERATIONS to [mike@contoso.com];
GRANT INSERT to [mike@contoso.com];

GRANT CREATE TABLE to [mike@contoso.com];
GRANT ALTER on SCHEMA::HR to [mike@contoso.com];
```

## Remarks

The COPY statement accepts only UTF-8 and UTF-16 valid characters for row data and command parameters. Source files or parameters (such as ROW TERMINATOR or FIELD TERMINATOR) that use invalid characters may be interpreted incorrectly by the COPY statement and cause unexpected results such as data corruption, or other failures. Make sure your source files and parameters are UTF-8 or UTF-16 compliant before you invoke the COPY statement.  

## Examples

### A. Load from a public storage account

The following example is the simplest form of the COPY command, which loads data from a public storage account. For this example, the COPY statement's defaults match the format of the line item csv file.

```sql
COPY INTO dbo.[lineitem]
FROM 'https://unsecureaccount.blob.core.windows.net/customerdatasets/folder1/lineitem.csv'
```

The default values of the COPY command are:

- DATEFORMAT = Session DATEFORMAT

- MAXERRORS = 0

- COMPRESSION default is uncompressed

- FIELDQUOTE = ''

- FIELDTERMINATOR = ','

- ROWTERMINATOR = '\n'

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> COPY treats `\n` as `\r\n` internally. For more information, see the ROWTERMINATOR section.

- FIRSTROW = 1

- ENCODING = 'UTF8'

- FILE_TYPE = 'CSV'

- IDENTITY_INSERT = 'OFF'

### B. Load authenticating via Share Access Signature (SAS)

The following example loads files that use the line feed as a row terminator such as a UNIX output. This example also uses a SAS key to authenticate to Azure Blob Storage.

```sql
COPY INTO test_1
FROM 'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myblobcontainer/folder1/'
WITH (
    FILE_TYPE = 'CSV',
    CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Shared Access Signature', SECRET='<Your_SAS_Token>'),
    --CREDENTIAL should look something like this:
    --CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Shared Access Signature', SECRET='?sv=2018-03-28&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rl&st=2016-10-17T20%3A14%3A55Z&se=2021-10-18T20%3A19%3A00Z&sig=IEoOdmeYnE9%2FKiJDSHFSYsz4AkNa%2F%2BTx61FuQ%2FfKHefqoBE%3D'),
    FIELDQUOTE = '"',
    FIELDTERMINATOR=';',
    ROWTERMINATOR='0X0A',
    ENCODING = 'UTF8',
    DATEFORMAT = 'ymd',
    MAXERRORS = 10,
    ERRORFILE = '/errorsfolder',--path starting from the storage container
    IDENTITY_INSERT = 'ON'
)
```

### C. Load with a column list with default values authenticating via Storage Account Key

This example loads files specifying a column list with default values.

```sql
--Note when specifying the column list, input field numbers start from 1
COPY INTO test_1 (Col_one default 'myStringDefault' 1, Col_two default 1 3)
FROM 'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myblobcontainer/folder1/'
WITH (
    FILE_TYPE = 'CSV',
    CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Storage Account Key', SECRET='<Your_Account_Key>'),
    --CREDENTIAL should look something like this:
    --CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Storage Account Key', SECRET='x6RWv4It5F2msnjelv3H4DA80n0PQW0daPdw43jM0nyetx4c6CpDkdj3986DX5AHFMIf/YN4y6kkCnU8lb+Wx0Pj+6MDw=='),
    FIELDQUOTE = '"',
    FIELDTERMINATOR=',',
    ROWTERMINATOR='0x0A',
    ENCODING = 'UTF8',
    FIRSTROW = 2
)
```

### D. Load Parquet or ORC using existing file format object

This example uses a wildcard to load all Parquet files under a folder.

```sql
COPY INTO test_parquet
FROM 'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myblobcontainer/folder1/*.parquet'
WITH (
    FILE_FORMAT = myFileFormat,
    CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Shared Access Signature', SECRET='<Your_SAS_Token>')
)
```

### E. Load specifying wild cards and multiple files

```sql
COPY INTO t1
FROM
'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myblobcontainer/folder0/*.txt',
    'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myblobcontainer/folder1'
WITH (
    FILE_TYPE = 'CSV',
    CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= '<client_id>@<OAuth_2.0_Token_EndPoint>',SECRET='<key>'),
    FIELDTERMINATOR = '|'
)
```

### F. Load using MSI credentials

```sql
COPY INTO dbo.myCOPYDemoTable
FROM 'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myblobcontainer/folder0/*.txt'
WITH (
    FILE_TYPE = 'CSV',
    CREDENTIAL = (IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity'),
    FIELDQUOTE = '"',
    FIELDTERMINATOR=','
)
```

### G. Load using automatic schema detection

```sql
COPY INTO [myCOPYDemoTable]
FROM 'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/customerdatasets/folder1/lineitem.parquet'
WITH (
    FILE_TYPE = 'Parquet',
    CREDENTIAL = ( IDENTITY = 'Shared Access Signature',  SECRET='<key>'),
    AUTO_CREATE_TABLE = 'ON'
)
```

## FAQ

### What is the performance of the COPY command compared to PolyBase?

The COPY command has better performance depending on your workload.

- Compressed files can't be split automatically. For best loading performance, consider splitting your input into multiple files when loading compressed CSVs.

- Large uncompressed CSV files can be split and loaded in parallel automatically, so there's no need to manually split uncompressed CSV files in most cases. In certain cases where auto file splitting isn't feasible due to data characteristics, manually splitting large CSVs may still benefit performance.

### What is the file splitting guidance for the COPY command loading compressed CSV files?

Guidance on the number of files is outlined in the following table. Once the recommended number of files are reached, you have better performance the larger the files. The number of files is determined by number of compute nodes multiplied by 60. For example, at 6000DWU we have 12 compute nodes and 12*60 = 720 partitions.  For a simple file splitting experience, refer to [How to maximize COPY load throughput with file splits](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-synapse-analytics/how-to-maximize-copy-load-throughput-with-file-splits/ba-p/1314474).

| DWU | #Files |
| :---: | :---: |
| 100 | 60 |
| 200 | 60 |
| 300 | 60 |
| 400 | 60 |
| 500 | 60 |
| 1,000 | 120 |
| 1,500 | 180 |
| 2,000 | 240 |
| 2,500 | 300 |
| 3,000 | 360 |
| 5,000 | 600 |
| 6,000 | 720 |
| 7,500 | 900 |
| 10,000 | 1200 |
| 15,000 | 1800 |
| 30,000 | 3600 |

### What is the file splitting guidance for the COPY command loading Parquet or ORC files?

There's no need to split Parquet and ORC files because the COPY command automatically splits files. Parquet and ORC files in the Azure storage account should be 256 MB or larger for best performance.

### Are there any limitations on the number or size of files?

There are no limitations on the number or size of files; however, for best performance, we recommend files that are at least 4 MB.

### Are there any known issues with the COPY statement?

If you have an Azure Synapse workspace that was created prior to December 7, 2020, you may run into a similar error message when authenticating using Managed Identity: `com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: Managed Service Identity has not been enabled on this server. Please enable Managed Service Identity and try again.`

Follow these steps to work around this issue by re-registering the workspace's managed identity:

1. Install Azure PowerShell. Refer to [Install PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json).
1. Register your workspace's managed identity using PowerShell: 
   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId <subscriptionId>
   Set-AzSqlServer -ResourceGroupName your-database-server-resourceGroup -ServerName your-SQL-servername -AssignIdentity
   ```

## Arguments

#### *warehouse_name*

Optional if the current warehouse for the user performing the operation is the warehouse of the specified table. If *warehouse* isn't specified, and the specified schema and table doesn't exist on the current warehouse, COPY fails, and an error message is returned.

#### *schema_name*

Optional if the default schema for the user performing the operation is the schema of the specified table. If *schema* isn't specified, and the default schema of the user performing the COPY operation is different from the specified table, COPY fails, and an error message is returned.

#### *table_name*

The name of the table to COPY data into. The target table must already exist in the warehouse.

#### *(column_list)*

An optional list of one or more columns used to map source data fields to target table columns for loading data.

*column_list* must be enclosed in parentheses and delimited by commas. The column list is of the following format:

[(Column_name [default Default_value] [Field_number] [,...n])]

- *Column_name* - the name of the column in the target table.
- *Default_value* - the default value that replaces any NULL value in the input file. Default value applies to all file formats. COPY attempts to load NULL from the input file when a column is omitted from the column list or when there's an empty input file field. Default value is preceded by the keyword 'default'
- *Field_number* - applies only to CSV. The input file field number that is mapped to the target column name. For Parquet, columns are always bound by name.
- The field indexing starts at 1.

When *column_list* isn't specified, COPY maps columns based on the source and target order: Input field 1 goes to target column 1, field 2 goes to column 2, etc.

> [!NOTE]  
> When working with Parquet files on [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](../../includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)], column names must match exactly in the source and destination. If the name of the column in target table is different than that of the column name in the parquet file, the target table column is filled with NULL.

When a column list isn't specified, COPY maps columns based on the source and target order: Input field 1 goes to target column 1, field 2 goes to column 2, etc.

#### *External locations*

Specifies where the files containing the data is staged. Currently Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 and Azure Blob Storage are supported:

- *External location* for Blob Storage: `https://<account\>.blob.core.windows.net/<container\>/<path\>`
- *External location* for ADLS Gen2: `https://<account\>.dfs.core.windows.net/<container\>/<path\>`

Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 offers better performance than Azure Blob Storage (legacy). Consider using an ADLS Gen2 account whenever possible.

> [!NOTE]  
> The .blob endpoint is available for ADLS Gen2 as well and currently yields the best performance. Use the .blob endpoint when .dfs is not required for your authentication method.

- *Account* - The storage account name

- *Container* - The blob container name

- *Path* - the folder or file path for the data. The location starts from the container. If a folder is specified, COPY retrieves all files from the folder and all its subfolders. COPY ignores hidden folders and doesn't return files that begin with an underline (_) or a period (.) unless explicitly specified in the path. This behavior is the same even when specifying a path with a wildcard.

Wildcards can be included in the path where

- Wildcard path name matching is case-sensitive
- Wildcard can be escaped using the backslash character (\\)

> [!NOTE]  
> For best performance, avoid specifying wildcards that would expand over a larger number of files. If possible, list multiple file locations instead of specifying wildcards.

Multiple file locations can only be specified from the same storage account and container via a comma-separated list such as:

- `https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container\>/<path\>`, `https://<account\>.blob.core.windows.net/<container\>/<path\>`

#### *FILE_TYPE = { 'CSV' | 'PARQUET' }*

*FILE_TYPE* specifies the format of the external data.

- CSV: Specifies a comma-separated values file compliant to the [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) standard.
- PARQUET: Specifies a Parquet format.

#### *CREDENTIAL (IDENTITY = '', SECRET = '')*

*CREDENTIAL* specifies the authentication mechanism to access the external storage account. On [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](../../includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)], the only supported authentication mechanisms are Shared Access Signature (SAS) and Storage Account Key (SAK).

> [!NOTE]  
> When using a public storage account, CREDENTIAL does not need to be specified.

- Authenticating with Shared Access Signature (SAS)

  - *IDENTITY: A constant with a value of 'Shared Access Signature'*
  - *SECRET: The* [*shared access signature*](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) *provides delegated access to resources in your storage account.*
  -  Minimum permissions required: READ and LIST

- Authenticating with Storage Account Key

  - *IDENTITY: A constant with a value of 'Storage Account Key'*
  - *SECRET: Storage account key*

#### *ERRORFILE = Directory Location*

*ERRORFILE* only applies to CSV. Specifies the directory where the rejected rows and the corresponding error file should be written. The full path from the storage account can be specified or the path relative to the container can be specified. If the specified path doesn't exist, one is created on your behalf. A child directory is created with the name "\_rejectedrows". The "\_" character ensures that the directory is escaped for other data processing unless explicitly named in the location parameter.

Within this directory, there's a folder created based on the time of load submission in the format YearMonthDay -HourMinuteSecond (Ex. 20180330-173205). In this folder a folder with the statement ID is created, and under that folder two types of files are written: an error.Json file containing the reject reasons, and a row.csv file containing the rejected rows.

If ERRORFILE has the full path of the storage account defined, then the ERRORFILE_CREDENTIAL is used to connect to that storage. Otherwise, the value mentioned for CREDENTIAL is used.

#### *ERRORFILE_CREDENTIAL = (IDENTITY= '', SECRET = '')*

*ERRORFILE_CREDENTIAL* only applies to CSV files.  On [!INCLUDE [fabricdw](../../includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)], the only supported authentication mechanism is Shared Access Signature (SAS).

- Authenticating with Shared Access Signatures (SAS)
  - *IDENTITY: A constant with a value of 'Shared Access Signature'*
  - *SECRET: The* [*shared access signature*](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) *provides delegated access to resources in your storage account.*
  - Minimum permissions required: READ, LIST, WRITE, CREATE, DELETE

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using the same storage account for your ERRORFILE and specifying the ERRORFILE path relative to the root of the container, you do not need to specify the ERROR_CREDENTIAL.

#### *MAXERRORS = max_errors*

*MAXERRORS* specifies the maximum number of reject rows allowed in the load before the COPY operation is canceled. Each row that the COPY operation can't import is ignored and counted as one error. If max_errors isn't specified, the default is 0.

#### *COMPRESSION = { 'Snappy' | 'GZIP' | 'NONE'}*

*COMPRESSION* is optional and specifies the data compression method for the external data.

- CSV supports GZIP
- Parquet supports GZIP and Snappy

The COPY command autodetects the compression type based on the file extension when this parameter isn't specified:

- .gz  - **GZIP**

#### *FIELDQUOTE = 'field_quote'*

*FIELDQUOTE* only applies to CSV. Specifies a single character that is used as the quote character (string delimiter) in the CSV file. If not specified, the quote character (") is used as the quote character as defined in the RFC 4180 standard. Extended ASCII and multi-byte characters and aren't supported with UTF-8 for FIELDQUOTE.

> [!NOTE]  
> FIELDQUOTE characters are escaped in string columns where there is a presence of a double FIELDQUOTE (delimiter).

#### *FIELDTERMINATOR = 'field_terminator'*

*FIELDTERMINATOR* only applies to CSV. Specifies the field terminator that is used in the CSV file. The field terminator can also be specified using hexadecimal notation. The field terminator can be multi-character. The default field terminator is a (,). Extended ASCII and multi-byte characters and aren't supported with UTF-8 for FIELDTERMINATOR.

#### ROW TERMINATOR = 'row_terminator'

*ROW TERMINATOR* only applies to CSV. Specifies the row terminator that is used in the CSV file. The row terminator can be specified using hexadecimal notation. The row terminator can be multi-character. By default, the row terminator is `\r\n`.

The COPY command prefixes the `\r` character when specifying `\n` (newline) resulting in `\r\n`. To specify only the `\n` character, use hexadecimal notation (`0x0A`). When specifying multi-character row terminators in hexadecimal, don't specify 0x between each character.

Extended ASCII and multi-byte characters and aren't supported with UTF-8 for ROW TERMINATOR.

#### *FIRSTROW = First_row_int*

*FIRSTROW* only applies to CSV. Specifies the row number that is read first in all files for the COPY command. Values start from 1, which is the default value. If the value is set to two, the first row in every file (header row) is skipped when the data is loaded. Rows are skipped based on the existence of row terminators.

#### *ENCODING = 'UTF8' | 'UTF16'*

ENCODING only applies to CSV. Default is UTF8. Specifies the data encoding standard for the files loaded by the COPY command.

## Remarks

COPY INTO in [!INCLUDE [fabricdw](../../includes/fabric-dw.md)] doesn't allow setting a date format for interpreting date character strings. By default, all dates are considered to have the month-day-year format. To ingest a CSV file with a different date format, use *SET DATEFORMAT* to specify the desired date format at the session level. For more information, see [SET DATEFORMAT (Transact-SQL)](set-dateformat-transact-sql.md).

Additionally, the COPY statement accepts only UTF-8 and UTF-16 valid characters for row data and command parameters. Source files or parameters (such as ROW TERMINATOR or FIELD TERMINATOR) that use invalid characters may be interpreted incorrectly by the COPY statement and cause unexpected results such as data corruption, or other failures. Make sure your source files and parameters are UTF-8 or UTF-16 compliant before you invoke the COPY statement.  

## Examples

For more information on using COPY INTO on your [!INCLUDE [fabricdw](../../includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)], see [Ingest data into your [!INCLUDE [fabricdw](../../includes/fabric-dw.md)] using the COPY statement](/fabric/data-warehouse/ingest-data-copy).

### A. Load from a public storage account

The following example is the simplest form of the COPY command, which loads data from a public storage account. For this example, the COPY statement's defaults match the format of the line item csv file.

```sql
COPY INTO dbo.[lineitem]
FROM 'https://unsecureaccount.blob.core.windows.net/customerdatasets/folder1/lineitem.csv'
```

The default values of the COPY command are:

- MAXERRORS = 0

- COMPRESSION default is uncompressed

- FIELDQUOTE = ''

- FIELDTERMINATOR = ','

- ROWTERMINATOR = '\n'

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> COPY treats `\n` as `\r\n` internally. For more information, see the ROWTERMINATOR section.

- FIRSTROW = 1

- ENCODING = 'UTF8'

- FILE_TYPE = 'CSV'

### B. Load authenticating via Share Access Signature (SAS)

The following example loads files that use the line feed as a row terminator such as a UNIX output. This example also uses a SAS key to authenticate to Azure Blob Storage.

```sql
COPY INTO test_1
FROM 'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myblobcontainer/folder1/'
WITH (
    FILE_TYPE = 'CSV',
    CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Shared Access Signature', SECRET='<Your_SAS_Token>'),
    --CREDENTIAL should look something like this:
    --CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Shared Access Signature', SECRET='?sv=2018-03-28&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rl&st=2016-10-17T20%3A14%3A55Z&se=2021-10-18T20%3A19%3A00Z&sig=IEoOdmeYnE9%2FKiJDSHFSYsz4AkNa%2F%2BTx61FuQ%2FfKHefqoBE%3D'),
    FIELDQUOTE = '"',
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ';',
    ROWTERMINATOR = '0X0A',
    ENCODING = 'UTF8',
    MAXERRORS = 10,
    ERRORFILE = '/errorsfolder'--path starting from the storage container
)
```

### C. Load with a column list with default values authenticating via Storage Account Key (SAK)

This example loads files specifying a column list with default values.

```sql
--Note when specifying the column list, input field numbers start from 1
COPY INTO test_1 (Col_one default 'myStringDefault' 1, Col_two default 1 3)
FROM 'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myblobcontainer/folder1/'
WITH (
    FILE_TYPE = 'CSV',
    CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Storage Account Key', SECRET='<Your_account_key>'),
    --CREDENTIAL should look something like this:
    --CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Storage Account Key', SECRET='x6RWv4It5F2msnjelv3H4DA80n0PQW0daPdw43jM0nyetx4c6CpDkdj3986DX5AHFMIf/YN4y6kkCnU8lb+Wx0Pj+6MDw=='),
    FIELDQUOTE = '"',
    FIELDTERMINATOR=',',
    ROWTERMINATOR='0x0A',
    ENCODING = 'UTF8',
    FIRSTROW = 2
)
```

### D. Load Parquet

This example uses a wildcard to load all Parquet files under a folder.

```sql
COPY INTO test_parquet
FROM 'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myblobcontainer/folder1/*.parquet'
WITH (
    CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Shared Access Signature', SECRET='<Your_SAS_Token>')
)
```

### E. Load specifying wild cards and multiple files

```sql
COPY INTO t1
FROM
'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myblobcontainer/folder0/*.txt',
    'https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myblobcontainer/folder1'
WITH (
    FILE_TYPE = 'CSV',
    CREDENTIAL=(IDENTITY= 'Shared Access Signature', SECRET='<Your_SAS_Token>')
    FIELDTERMINATOR = '|'
)
```

## FAQ

### What is the file splitting guidance for the COPY command loading compressed CSV files?

Consider splitting large CSV files, but keep files at a minimum of 4 MB each for better performance.

### What is the file splitting guidance for the COPY command loading Parquet files?

There's no need to split Parquet because the COPY command splits files automatically. Parquet files in the Azure storage account should be 256 MB or larger for best performance.

### Are there any limitations on the number or size of files?

There are no limitations on the number or size of files; however, for best performance, we recommend files that are at least 4 MB.
