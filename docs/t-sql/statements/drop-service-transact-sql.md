 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
DROP SERVICE service_name  
[ ; ]  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *service_name*  
 The name of the service to drop. Server, database, and schema names cannot be specified.  
  
## Remarks  
 You cannot drop a service if any conversation priorities refer to it.  
  
 Dropping a service deletes all messages for the service from the queue that the service uses. [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../includes/sssb-md.md)] sends an error to the remote side of any open conversations that use the service.  
  
## Permissions  
 Permission for dropping a service defaults to the owner of the service, members of the db_ddladmin or db_owner fixed database roles, and members of the sysadmin fixed server role.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example drops the service `//Adventure-Works.com/Expenses`.  
  
```sql  
DROP SERVICE [//Adventure-Works.com/Expenses] ;  
```
