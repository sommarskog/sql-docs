## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
DROP CONTRACT contract_name   
[ ; ]  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *contract_name*  
 The name of the contract to drop. Server, database, and schema names cannot be specified.  
  
## Remarks  
 You cannot drop a contract if any services or conversation priorities refer to the contract.  
  
 When you drop a contract, [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../includes/sssb-md.md)] ends any existing conversations that use the contract with an error.  
  
## Permissions  
 Permission for dropping a contract defaults to the owner of the contract, members of the db_ddladmin or db_owner fixed database roles, and members of the sysadmin fixed server role.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example removes the contract `//Adventure-Works.com/Expenses/ExpenseSubmission` from the database.  
  
```sql  
DROP CONTRACT [//Adventure-Works.com/Expenses/ExpenseSubmission] ;  
```
