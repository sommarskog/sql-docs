# CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa.md)]

  Creates an asymmetric key in the database.  
  
 This feature is incompatible with database export using Data Tier Application Framework (DACFx). You must drop all asymmetric keys before exporting.

## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql

## Arguments
 *asym_key_name*  
 Is the name for the asymmetric key in the database. Asymmetric key names must comply with the rules for [identifiers](../../relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers.md) and must be unique within the database.  

 AUTHORIZATION *database_principal_name*  
 Specifies the owner of the asymmetric key. The owner cannot be a role or a group. If this option is omitted, the owner will be the current user.  
  
 FROM *asym_key_source*  
 Specifies the source from which to load the asymmetric key pair.  
  
 FILE = '*path_to_strong-name_file*'  
 Specifies the path of a strong-name file from which to load the key pair. Limited to 260 characters by MAX_PATH from the Windows API.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is not available in a contained database.  
  
 EXECUTABLE FILE = '*path_to_executable_file*'  
 Specifies the path of an assembly file from which to load the public key. Limited to 260 characters by MAX_PATH from the Windows API.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is not available in a contained database.  
  
 ASSEMBLY *assembly_name*  
 Specifies the name of a signed assembly that has already been loaded into the database from which to load the public key.  
  
 PROVIDER *provider_name*  
 Specifies the name of an Extensible Key Management (EKM) provider. The provider must be defined first using the CREATE PROVIDER statement. For more information about external key management, see [Extensible Key Management &#40;EKM&#41;](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/extensible-key-management-ekm.md).  
  
 ALGORITHM = \<algorithm>  
 Five algorithms can be provided; RSA_4096, RSA_3072, RSA_2048, RSA_1024, and RSA_512.  
  
 RSA_1024 and RSA_512 are deprecated. To use RSA_1024 or RSA_512 (not recommended) you must set the database to database compatibility level 120 or lower.  
  
 PROVIDER_KEY_NAME = '*key_name_in_provider*'  
 Specifies the key name from the external provider.  
  
 CREATION_DISPOSITION = CREATE_NEW  
 Creates a new key on the Extensible Key Management device. PROVIDER_KEY_NAME must be used to specify key name on the device. If a key already exists on the device the statement fails with error.  
  
 CREATION_DISPOSITION = OPEN_EXISTING  
 Maps a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] asymmetric key to an existing Extensible Key Management key. PROVIDER_KEY_NAME must be used to specify key name on the device. If CREATION_DISPOSITION = OPEN_EXISTING is not provided, the default is CREATE_NEW.  
  
 ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '*password*'  
 Specifies the password with which to encrypt the private key. If this clause is not present, the private key will be encrypted with the database master key. *password* is a maximum of 128 characters. *password* must meet the Windows password policy requirements of the computer that is running the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Remarks  
 An *asymmetric key* is a securable entity at the database level. In its default form, this entity contains both a public key and a private key. When executed without the FROM clause, CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY generates a new key pair. When executed with the FROM clause, CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY imports a key pair from a file, or imports a public key from an assembly or DLL file.  
  
 By default, the private key is protected by the database master key. If no database master key has been created, a password is required to protect the private key.  
  
 The private key can be 512, 1024, or 2048 bits long.
 
 Asymmetric Keys used for TDE are limited to a private key size of 3072 bits.
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY permission on the database. If the AUTHORIZATION clause is specified, requires IMPERSONATE permission on the database principal, or ALTER permission on the application role. Only Windows logins, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] logins, and application roles can own asymmetric keys. Groups and roles cannot own asymmetric keys.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Creating an asymmetric key  
 The following example creates an asymmetric key named `PacificSales09` by using the `RSA_2048` algorithm, and protects the private key with a password.  
  
```sql  
CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PacificSales09   
    WITH ALGORITHM = RSA_2048   
    ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '<enterStrongPasswordHere>';   
GO  
```  
  
### B. Creating an asymmetric key from a file, giving authorization to a user  
 The following example creates the asymmetric key `PacificSales19` from a key pair stored in a file, and assigns ownership of the asymmetric key to user `Christina`. The private key is protected by the database master key, which must be created prior to creating the asymmetric key.  
  
```sql  
CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PacificSales19  
    AUTHORIZATION Christina  
    FROM FILE = 'c:\PacSales\Managers\ChristinaCerts.tmp';  
GO  
```  
  
### C. Creating an asymmetric key from an EKM provider  
 The following example creates the asymmetric key `EKM_askey1` from a key pair stored in an Extensible Key Management provider called `EKM_Provider1`, and a key on that provider called `key10_user1`.  
  
```sql  
CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY EKM_askey1   
    FROM PROVIDER EKM_Provider1  
    WITH   
        ALGORITHM = RSA_2048,   
        CREATION_DISPOSITION = CREATE_NEW  
        , PROVIDER_KEY_NAME  = 'key10_user1' ;  
GO  
```
