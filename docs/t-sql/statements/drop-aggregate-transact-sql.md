# DROP AGGREGATE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

  Removes a user-defined aggregate function from the current database. User-defined aggregate functions are created by using [CREATE AGGREGATE](../../t-sql/statements/create-aggregate-transact-sql.md).  
  
 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql  
DROP AGGREGATE [ IF EXISTS ] [ schema_name . ] aggregate_name  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *IF EXISTS*  
 **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ( [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] through [current version](/troubleshoot/sql/general/determine-version-edition-update-level)).  
  
 Conditionally drops the aggregate only if it already exists.  
  
 *schema_name*  
 Is the name of the schema to which the user-defined aggregate function belongs.  
  
 *aggregate_name*  
 Is the name of the user-defined aggregate function you want to drop.  
  
## Remarks  
 DROP AGGREGATE does not execute if there are any views, functions, or stored procedures created with schema binding that reference the user-defined aggregate function you want to drop.  
  
## Permissions  
 To execute DROP AGGREGATE, at a minimum, a user must have ALTER permission on the schema to which the user-defined aggregate belongs, or CONTROL permission on the aggregate.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example drops the aggregate `Concatenate`.  
  
```sql  
DROP AGGREGATE dbo.Concatenate;  
```
