 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
DENY permission [ ,...n ]   
    TO <grantee_principal> [ ,...n ]  
    [ CASCADE ]  
    [ AS <grantor_principal> ]   
  
<grantee_principal> ::= SQL_Server_login   
    | SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_Windows_login  
    | SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_Windows_group  
    | SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_certificate  
    | SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_asymmetric_key  
    | server_role  
  
<grantor_principal> ::= SQL_Server_login   
    | SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_Windows_login  
    | SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_Windows_group  
    | SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_certificate  
    | SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_asymmetric_key  
    | server_role  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be denied on a server. For a list of the permissions, see the Remarks section later in this topic.  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission is denied to the specified principal and to all other principals to which the principal granted the permission. Required when the principal has the permission with GRANT OPTION. 
  
 TO \<server_principal>  
 Specifies the principal to which the permission is denied.  
  
 AS \<grantor_principal>  
 Specifies the principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to deny the permission.
 Use the AS principal clause to indicate that the principal recorded as the denier of the permission should be a principal other than the person executing the statement. For example, presume that user Mary is principal_id 12 and user Raul is principal 15. Mary executes `DENY SELECT ON OBJECT::X TO Steven WITH GRANT OPTION AS Raul;` Now the sys.database_permissions table will indicate that the grantor_prinicpal_id of the deny statement was 15 (Raul) even though the statement was actually executed by user 13 (Mary).
  
The use of AS in this statement does not imply the ability to impersonate another user.    
  
 *SQL_Server_login*  
 Specifies a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login.  
  
 *SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_Windows_login*  
 Specifies a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login mapped to a Windows login.  
  
 *SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_Windows_group*  
 Specifies a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login mapped to a Windows group.  
  
 *SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_certificate*  
 Specifies a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login mapped to a certificate.  
  
 *SQL_Server_login_mapped_to_asymmetric_key*  
 Specifies a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login mapped to an asymmetric key.  
  
 *server_role*  
 Specifies a server role.  
  
## Remarks  
 Permissions at the server scope can be denied only when the current database is master.  
  
 Information about server permissions can be viewed in the [sys.server_permissions](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-server-permissions-transact-sql.md) catalog view, and information about server principals can be viewed in the [sys.server_principals](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-server-principals-transact-sql.md) catalog view. Information about membership of server roles can be viewed in the [sys.server_role_members](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-server-role-members-transact-sql.md) catalog view.  
  
 A server is the highest level of the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denies on a server are listed in the following table.

 The following three server permissions were added in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)].  
  
 **CONNECT ANY DATABASE** Permission  
 Grant **CONNECT ANY DATABASE** to a login that must connect to all databases that currently exist and to any new databases that might be created in future. Does not grant any permission in any database beyond connect. Combine with **SELECT ALL USER SECURABLES** or **VIEW SERVER STATE** to allow an auditing process to view all data or all database states on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 **IMPERSONATE ANY LOGIN** Permission  
 When granted, allows a middle-tier process to impersonate the account of clients connecting to it, as it connects to databases. When denied, a high privileged login can be blocked from impersonating other logins. For example, a login with **CONTROL SERVER** permission can be blocked from impersonating other logins.  
  
 **SELECT ALL USER SECURABLES** Permission  
 When granted, a login such as an auditor can view data in all databases that the user can connect to. When denied, prevents access to objects unless they are in the **sys** schema.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL SERVER permission or ownership of the securable. If you use the AS clause, the specified principal must own the securable on which permissions are being denied.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Denying CONNECT SQL permission to a SQL Server login and principals to which the login has regranted it  
 The following example denies `CONNECT SQL` permission to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login `Annika` and to the principals to which she has granted the permission.  
  
```sql  
USE master;  
DENY CONNECT SQL TO Annika CASCADE;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Denying CREATE ENDPOINT permission to a SQL Server login using the AS option  
 The following example denies `CREATE ENDPOINT` permission to the user `ArifS`. The example uses the `AS` option to specify `MandarP` as the principal from which the executing principal derives the authority to do so.  
  
```sql  
USE master;  
DENY CREATE ENDPOINT TO ArifS AS MandarP;  
GO  
```
