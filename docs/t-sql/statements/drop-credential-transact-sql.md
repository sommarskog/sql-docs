 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
DROP CREDENTIAL credential_name  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *credential_name*  
 Is the name of the credential to remove from the server.  
  
## Remarks  
 To drop the secret associated with a credential without dropping the credential itself, use [ALTER CREDENTIAL](../../t-sql/statements/alter-credential-transact-sql.md).  
  
 Information about credentials is visible in the **sys.credentials** catalog view.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  Proxies are associated with a credential. Deleting a credential that is used by a proxy leaves the associated proxy in an unusable state. When dropping a credential used by a proxy, delete the proxy (by using [sp_delete_proxy &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-delete-proxy-transact-sql.md) and recreate the associated proxy by using [sp_add_proxy &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-add-proxy-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires ALTER ANY CREDENTIAL permission. If dropping a system credential, requires CONTROL SERVER permission.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example removes the credential called `Saddles`.  
  
```sql  
DROP CREDENTIAL Saddles;  
GO  
```
