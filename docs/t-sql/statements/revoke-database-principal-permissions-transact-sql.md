## Arguments
 *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be revoked on the database principal. For a list of the permissions, see the Remarks section later in this topic.  
  
 USER ::*database_user*  
 Specifies the class and name of the user on which the permission is being revoked. The scope qualifier (**::**) is required.  
  
 ROLE ::*database_role*  
 Specifies the class and name of the role on which the permission is being revoked. The scope qualifier (**::**) is required.  
  
 APPLICATION ROLE ::*application_role*  
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later, [!INCLUDE[sqldbesa](../../includes/sqldbesa-md.md)]
  
 Specifies the class and name of the application role on which the permission is being revoked. The scope qualifier (**::**) is required.  
  
 GRANT OPTION  
 Indicates that the right to grant the specified permission to other principals will be revoked. The permission itself will not be revoked.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If the principal has the specified permission without the GRANT option, the permission itself will be revoked.  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission being revoked is also revoked from other principals to which it has been granted or denied by this principal.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  A cascaded revocation of a permission granted WITH GRANT OPTION will revoke both GRANT and DENY of that permission.  
  
 AS \<database_principal> 
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to revoke the permission.  
  
 *Database_user*  
 Specifies a database user.  
  
 *Database_role*  
 Specifies a database role.  
  
 *Application_role*  
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later, [!INCLUDE[sqldbesa](../../includes/sqldbesa-md.md)]
  
 Specifies an application role.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_User*  
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later
  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a Windows user.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_Windows_Group*  
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later
  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a Windows group.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_certificate*  
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later
  
 Specifies a database user mapped to a certificate.  
  
 *Database_user_mapped_to_asymmetric_key*  
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later
  
 Specifies a database user mapped to an asymmetric key.  
  
 *Database_user_with_no_login*  
 Specifies a database user with no corresponding server-level principal.  
  
## Remarks  
  
## Database User Permissions  
 A database user is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be revoked on a database user are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Database user permission|Implied by database user permission|Implied by database permission|  
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|IMPERSONATE|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY USER|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Database Role Permissions  
 A database role is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be revoked on a database role are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Database role permission|Implied by database role permission|Implied by database permission|  
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY ROLE|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Application Role Permissions  
 An application role is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be revoked on an application role are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Application role permission|Implied by application role permission|Implied by database permission|  
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY APPLICATION ROLE|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on the specified principal, or a higher permission that implies CONTROL permission.  
  
 Grantees of CONTROL permission on a database, such as members of the **db_owner** fixed database role, can grant any permission on any securable in the database.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Revoking CONTROL permission on a user from another user  
 The following example revokes `CONTROL` permission on [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] user `Wanida` from user `RolandX`.  
  
```sql  
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
REVOKE CONTROL ON USER::Wanida FROM RolandX;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Revoking VIEW DEFINITION permission on a role from a user to which it was granted WITH GRANT OPTION  
 The following example revokes `VIEW DEFINITION` permission on [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] role `SammamishParking` from database user `JinghaoLiu`. The `CASCADE` option is specified because the user `JinghaoLiu` was granted `VIEW DEFINITION` permission `WITH GRANT OPTION`.  
  
```sql 
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
REVOKE VIEW DEFINITION ON ROLE::SammamishParking   
    FROM JinghaoLiu CASCADE;  
GO  
```  
  
### C. Revoking IMPERSONATE permission on a user from an application role  
 The following example revokes `IMPERSONATE` permission on the user `HamithaL` from [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] application role `AccountsPayable17`.  
  
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later, [!INCLUDE[sqldbesa](../../includes/sqldbesa-md.md)]
  
```sql  
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
REVOKE IMPERSONATE ON USER::HamithaL FROM AccountsPayable17;  
GO    
```
