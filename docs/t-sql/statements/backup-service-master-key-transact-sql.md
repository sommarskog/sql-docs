 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
BACKUP SERVICE MASTER KEY TO FILE = 'path_to_file'   
    ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'password'  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 FILE **='***path_to_file***'**  
 Specifies the complete path, including file name, to the file to which the service master key will be exported. This may be a local path or a UNC path to a network location.  
  
 PASSWORD **='***password***'**  
 Is the password used to encrypt the service master key in the backup file. This password is subject to complexity checks. For more information, see [Password Policy](../../relational-databases/security/password-policy.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 The service master key should be backed up and stored in a secure, off-site location. Creating this backup should be one of the first administrative actions performed on the server.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL SERVER permission on the server.  
  
## Examples  
 In the following example, the service master key is backed up to a file.  
  
```sql  
BACKUP SERVICE MASTER KEY TO FILE = 'c:\temp_backups\keys\service_master_key' ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '3dH85Hhk003GHk2597gheij4';  
```
