# SET STATISTICS PROFILE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Displays the profile information for a statement. STATISTICS PROFILE works for ad hoc queries, views, and stored procedures.  
  
 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
  
SET STATISTICS PROFILE { ON | OFF }  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Remarks
 When STATISTICS PROFILE is ON, each executed query returns its regular result set, followed by an additional result set that shows a profile of the query execution.  
  
 The additional result set contains the SHOWPLAN_ALL columns for the query and these additional columns.  
  
|Column name|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|**Rows**|Actual number of rows produced by each operator|  
|**Executes**|Number of times the operator has been executed|  
  
## Permissions  
 To use SET STATISTICS PROFILE and view the output, users must have the following permissions:  
  
-   Appropriate permissions to execute the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements.  
  
-   SHOWPLAN permission on all databases containing objects that are referenced by the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements.  
  
 For [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that do not produce STATISTICS PROFILE result sets, only the appropriate permissions to execute the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements are required. For [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that do produce STATISTICS PROFILE result sets, checks for both the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement execution permission and the SHOWPLAN permission must succeed, or the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement execution is aborted and no Showplan information is generated.
