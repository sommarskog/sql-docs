# CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [asa](../../includes/applies-to-version/asa.md)]

Creates a classifier object for use in workload management.  The classifier assigns incoming requests to a workload group based on the parameters specified in the classifier statement definition.  Classifiers are evaluated with every request submitted.  If a request is not matched to a classifier, it is assigned to the default workload group.  The default workload group is the smallrc resource class.

> [!NOTE]
> Classifying managed identities (MI) behavior differs between the dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse workspaces and the standalone dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW).  While the standalone dedicated SQL pool MI maintains the assigned identity, Azure Synapse workspaces adds MI to the **dbo** role.  This cannot be changed.  The dbo role, by default, is classified  to smallrc.  Creating a classifier for the dbo role allows for assigning requests to a workload group other than smallrc.  If dbo alone is too generic for classification and has broader impacts, consider using label, session or time-based classification in conjunction with the dbo role classification.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER classifier_name  
WITH  
    (   WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'name'  
    ,   MEMBERNAME = 'security_account' 
[ [ , ] WLM_LABEL = 'label' ]  
[ [ , ] WLM_CONTEXT = 'context' ]  
[ [ , ] START_TIME = 'HH:MM' ]  
[ [ , ] END_TIME = 'HH:MM' ]  
  
[ [ , ] IMPORTANCE = { LOW | BELOW_NORMAL | NORMAL | ABOVE_NORMAL | HIGH }]) 
[;]
```

## Arguments

 *classifier_name*  
 Specifies the name by which the workload classifier is identified.  classifier_name is a sysname.  It can be up to 128 characters long and must be unique within the instance.

 *WORKLOAD_GROUP* = *'name'*   
 When the conditions are met by the classifier rules, name maps the request to a workload group.  name is a sysname.  It can be up to 128 characters long and must be a valid workload group name at the time of classifier creation.

 Available workload groups can be found in [sys.workload_management_workload_groups](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-workload-management-workload-groups-transact-sql.md) catalog view.

 *MEMBERNAME* = *'security_account'*    
 The security account used to classified against.  Security_account is a sysname, with no default. Security_account can be a database user, database role, Azure Active Directory login, or Azure Active Directory group.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the ```user_name()``` function, when connected to the system, to verify the membername that the classification process will use to classify the request.  Verifying the membername with the ```user_name()``` function can be helpful troubleshooting AAD or service principal classification issues.  If ```user_name()``` returns "dbo" you can use "dbo" as the membername to classify the requests.  Keep in mind all members of the "dbo" role will be classified.  Additional classification parameters such as *WLM_LABEL* or *WLM_CONTEXT* can also be used to specifically classify requests from multiple AAD accounts mapping to the "dbo" role.
 
 *WLM_LABEL*   
 Specifies the label value that a request can be classified against.  Label is an optional parameter of type nvarchar(255).  Use the [OPTION (LABEL)](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-develop-label) in the request to match the classifier configuration.

Example:

```sql
CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER wcELTLoads WITH  
( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgDataLoad'
 ,MEMBERNAME     = 'ELTRole'  
 ,WLM_LABEL      = 'dimension_loads' )

SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM DimCustomer
  OPTION (LABEL = 'dimension_loads')
```

*WLM_CONTEXT*  
Specifies the session context value that a request can be classified against.  context is an optional parameter of type nvarchar(255).  Use the [sys.sp_set_session_context](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-set-session-context-transact-sql.md?view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) with the variable name equal to `wlm_context` prior to submitting a request to set the session context.

Example:

```sql
CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER wcDataLoad WITH  
( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgDataLoad'
 ,MEMBERNAME     = 'ELTRole'
 ,WLM_CONTEXT    = 'dim_load' )
 
--set session context
EXEC sys.sp_set_session_context @key = 'wlm_context', @value = 'dim_load'

--run multiple statements using the wlm_context setting
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stg.daily_customer_load
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stg.daily_sales_load

--turn off the wlm_context session setting
EXEC sys.sp_set_session_context @key = 'wlm_context', @value = null
```

*START_TIME* and *END_TIME*  
Specifies the start_time and end_time that a request can be classified against.  Both start_time and end_time are of the HH:MM format in UTC time zone.  Start_time and end_time must be specified together.

Example:

```sql
CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER wcELTLoads WITH  
( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgDataLoads'
 ,MEMBERNAME     = 'ELTRole'  
 ,START_TIME     = '22:00'
 ,END_TIME       = '02:00' )
```

*IMPORTANCE* = { LOW \| BELOW_NORMAL \| NORMAL \| ABOVE_NORMAL \| HIGH }  
Specifies the relative importance of a request.  Importance is one of the following:

- LOW
- BELOW_NORMAL
- NORMAL (default)
- ABOVE_NORMAL
- HIGH  

If importance is not specified, the importance setting of the workload group is used.  The default workload group importance is normal.  Importance influences the order which requests are scheduled, thus giving first access to resources and locks.

## Classification parameter weighting

A request can match against multiple classifiers.  There is a weighting for the classifier parameters.  The higher weighted matching classifier is used to assign a workload group and importance.  The weighting goes as follows:

|Classifier Parameter |Weight   |
|---------------------|---------|
|USER                 |64       |
|ROLE                 |32       |
|WLM_LABEL            |16       |
|WLM_CONTEXT          |8        |
|START_TIME/END_TIME  |4        |

Consider the following classifier configurations.

```sql
CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER classifierA WITH  
( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgDashboards'  
 ,MEMBERNAME     = 'userloginA'
 ,IMPORTANCE     = HIGH
 ,WLM_LABEL      = 'salereport' )

CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER classifierB WITH  
( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgUserQueries'  
 ,MEMBERNAME     = 'userloginA'
 ,IMPORTANCE     = LOW
 ,START_TIME     = '18:00'
 ,END_TIME       = '07:00' )
```

The user `userloginA` is configured for both classifiers.  If userloginA runs a query with a label equal to `salesreport` between 6PM and 7AM UTC, the request will be classified to the wgDashboards workload group with HIGH importance.  The expectation may be to classify the request to wgUserQueries with LOW importance for off-hours reporting, but the weighting of WLM_LABEL is higher than START_TIME/END_TIME.  The weighting of classifierA is 80 (64 for user, plus 16 for WLM_LABEL).  The weighting of classifierB is 68 (64 for user, 4 for START_TIME/END_TIME).  In this case, you can add WLM_LABEL to classifierB.

 For more information see, [workload weighting](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-workload-classification#classification-weighting).

## Permissions

 Requires CONTROL DATABASE permission.  
  
## Examples

 The following example shows how to create a workload classifier named `wgcELTRole`. It uses the staticrc20 workload group, the user `ELTRole`, and sets the importance to `above_normal`.

```sql
CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER wgcELTRole
  WITH (WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'staticrc20'
       ,MEMBERNAME = 'ELTRole'
      ,IMPORTANCE = above_normal);
```
