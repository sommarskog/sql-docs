# DROP SIGNATURE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Drops a digital signature from a stored procedure, function, trigger, or assembly.  
  
 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
DROP [ COUNTER ] SIGNATURE FROM module_name   
    BY <crypto_list> [ ,...n ]  
  
<crypto_list> ::=  
    CERTIFICATE cert_name  
    | ASYMMETRIC KEY Asym_key_name  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *module_name*  
 Is the name of a stored procedure, function, assembly, or trigger.  
  
 CERTIFICATE *cert_name*  
 Is the name of a certificate with which the stored procedure, function, assembly, or trigger is signed.  
  
 ASYMMETRIC KEY *Asym_key_name*  
 Is the name of an asymmetric key with which the stored procedure, function, assembly, or trigger is signed.  
  
## Remarks  
 Information about signatures is visible in the sys.crypt_properties catalog view.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires ALTER permission on the object and CONTROL permission on the certificate or asymmetric key. If an associated private key is protected by a password, the user also must have the password.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example removes the signature of certificate `HumanResourcesDP` from the stored procedure `HumanResources.uspUpdateEmployeeLogin`.  
  
```sql  
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
DROP SIGNATURE FROM HumanResources.uspUpdateEmployeeLogin   
    BY CERTIFICATE HumanResourcesDP;  
GO  
```
