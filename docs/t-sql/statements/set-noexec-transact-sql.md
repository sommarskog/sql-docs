# SET NOEXEC (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Compiles each query but does not execute it.  
  
 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
  
SET NOEXEC { ON | OFF }  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Remarks  
 When SET NOEXEC is ON, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] parses and compiles each batch of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements but does not execute them. When SET NOEXEC is OFF, all batches are executed after compilation.  NOEXEC supports deferred name resolution; if one or more referenced objects in the batch don't exist, no error will be thrown.
  
 The execution of statements in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has two phases: compilation and execution. This setting is useful for having [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] validate the syntax and object names in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] code when executing. It is also useful for debugging statements that would generally be part of a larger batch of statements.  
  
 The setting of SET NOEXEC is set at execute or run time and not at parse time.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires membership in the public role.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses `NOEXEC` with a valid query, a query with an object name that is not valid, and a query with incorrect syntax.  
  
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
GO  
PRINT 'Valid query';  
GO  
-- SET NOEXEC to ON.  
SET NOEXEC ON;  
GO  
-- Inner join.  
SELECT e.BusinessEntityID, e.JobTitle, v.Name  
FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e   
   INNER JOIN Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader AS poh  
   ON e.BusinessEntityID = poh.EmployeeID  
   INNER JOIN Purchasing.Vendor AS v  
   ON poh.VendorID = v.BusinessEntityID;  
GO  
-- SET NOEXEC to OFF.  
SET NOEXEC OFF;  
GO  
  
PRINT 'Invalid object name';  
GO  
-- SET NOEXEC to ON.  
SET NOEXEC ON;  
GO  
-- Function name used is a reserved keyword.  
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
GO  
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.Values(@BusinessEntityID int)  
RETURNS TABLE  
AS  
RETURN (SELECT PurchaseOrderID, TotalDue  
   FROM dbo.PurchaseOrderHeader  
   WHERE VendorID = @BusinessEntityID);  
  
-- SET NOEXEC to OFF.  
SET NOEXEC OFF;  
GO  
  
PRINT 'Invalid syntax';  
GO  
-- SET NOEXEC to ON.  
SET NOEXEC ON;  
GO  
-- Built-in function incorrectly invoked.  
SELECT *  
FROM fn_helpcollations;  
-- Reset SET NOEXEC to OFF.  
SET NOEXEC OFF;  
GO  
```
