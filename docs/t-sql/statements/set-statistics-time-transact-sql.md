# SET STATISTICS TIME (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]	

  Displays the number of milliseconds required to parse, compile, and execute each statement.  
  
 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
  
SET STATISTICS TIME { ON | OFF }  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Remarks
 When SET STATISTICS TIME is ON, the time statistics for a statement are displayed. When OFF, the time statistics are not displayed.  
  
 The setting of SET STATISTICS TIME is set at execute or run time and not at parse time.  
  
 Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is unable to provide accurate statistics in fiber mode, which is activated when you enable the **lightweight pooling** configuration option.  
  
 The **cpu** column in the **sysprocesses** table is only updated when a query executes with SET STATISTICS TIME ON. When SET STATISTICS TIME is OFF, **0** is returned.  
  
 ON and OFF settings also affect the CPU column in the Process Info View for Current Activity in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
## Permissions  
 To use SET STATISTICS TIME, users must have the appropriate permissions to execute the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement. The SHOWPLAN permission is not required.  
  
## Examples  
 This example shows the server execution, parse, and compile times.  
  
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
GO         
SET STATISTICS TIME ON;  
GO  
SELECT ProductID, StartDate, EndDate, StandardCost   
FROM Production.ProductCostHistory  
WHERE StandardCost < 500.00;  
GO  
SET STATISTICS TIME OFF;  
GO  
```  
  
 Here is the result set:  
  
```  
SQL Server parse and compile time:   
   CPU time = 0 ms, elapsed time = 1 ms.  
SQL Server parse and compile time:   
   CPU time = 0 ms, elapsed time = 1 ms.  
  
(269 row(s) affected)  
  
SQL Server Execution Times:  
   CPU time = 0 ms,  elapsed time = 2 ms.  
SQL Server parse and compile time:   
   CPU time = 0 ms, elapsed time = 1 ms.  
  
```
