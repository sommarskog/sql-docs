## Syntax

```syntaxsql
SET RECOMMENDATIONS { ON | OFF };
```  

## Arguments

#### ON
Enables Distribution Advisor for the current client session. Subsequently run queries will be taken into consideration for distribution strategy recommendations.

#### OFF
Turns Distribution Advisor OFF for the current client session. Returns advice as a string.

## Remarks

Applies to [!INCLUDE [ssSDW](../../includes/ssazuresynapse_sqlpool_only.md)] only.

Run this command when connected to a user database.

## Permissions

Requires membership in the public role.

## Examples

Following example will return distribution recommendation on selected TPC-DS queries. TPC-DS is an industry standard benchmark for analytical decision support workloads.

First, begin the distribution advisor recommendation collection and run sample queries.

```sql
-- Step 1: Turn the distribution advisor ON for the current client session
SET RECOMMENDATIONS ON;
GO

-- <insert your queries here, up to 100>
SELECT ss_store_sk, COUNT(*) FROM store_sales, store WHERE ss_store_sk = s_store_sk GROUP BY ss_store_sk;

SELECT cs_item_sk, COUNT(*) FROM catalog_sales, item WHERE cs_item_sk = i_item_sk  AND i_manufact_id > 100 GROUP BY cs_item_sk;

SELECT * FROM dbo.reason;

-- Turn the distribution advisor OFF for the current client session.
SET RECOMMENDATIONS OFF;
GO
```

Collect recommendations from the dynamic management view `sys.dm_pdw_distrib_advisor_results` for the current session. For example:

```sql

-- Step 2: view advice generated for the above workload
DECLARE @sessionid nvarchar(100), @recommendation nvarchar(max);
SELECT @sessionid = SESSION_ID();
SELECT @recommendation = recommendation FROM sys.dm_pdw_distrib_advisor_results WHERE session_id = @sessionid;
SELECT @recommendation;
GO
```
