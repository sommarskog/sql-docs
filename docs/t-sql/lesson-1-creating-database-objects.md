# Lesson 1: Create and query database objects

[!INCLUDE[sql-asdb-asdbmi-pdw-md](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-pdw.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> The [Get Started Querying with Transact-SQL](/training/paths/get-started-querying-with-transact-sql/) learning path provides more in-depth content, along with practical examples.

This lesson shows you how to create a database, create a table in the database, and then access and change the data in the table. Because this lesson is an introduction to using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)], it doesn't use or describe the many options that are available for these statements.

[!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements can be written and submitted to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] in the following ways:

- By using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. This tutorial assumes that you are using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], but you can also use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] Express, which is available as a free download from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=14630).

- By using the [**sqlcmd**](../tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility.md) utility.

- By connecting from an application that you create.

The code executes on the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] in the same way and with the same permissions, regardless of how you submit the code statements.

To run [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], open [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] and connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)].

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need SQL Server Management Studio and access to a SQL Server instance.

- Install [SQL Server Management Studio](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).

If you don't have a SQL Server instance, create one. To create one, select your platform from the following links. If you choose SQL Authentication, use your SQL Server login credentials.

- **Windows**: [Download SQL Server 2022 Developer Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
- **Linux**: [Download SQL Server 2022 in a container](../linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker.md).

## Create a database

Like many [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements, the [CREATE DATABASE](statements/create-database-transact-sql.md) statement has a required parameter: the name of the database. `CREATE DATABASE` also has many optional parameters, such as the disk location where you want to put the database files. When you execute `CREATE DATABASE` without the optional parameters, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses default values for many of these parameters.

1. In a Query Editor window, type but don't execute the following code:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE TestData
    GO
    ```

1. Use the pointer to select the words `CREATE DATABASE`, and then press **F1**. The `CREATE DATABASE` article should open. You can use this technique to find the complete syntax for `CREATE DATABASE` and for the other statements that are used in this tutorial.

1. In Query Editor, press **F5** to execute the statement and create a database named `TestData`.

When you create a database, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] makes a copy of the `model` database, and renames the copy to the database name. This operation should only take several seconds, unless you specify a large initial size of the database as an optional parameter.

> [!NOTE]  
> The keyword GO separates statements when more than one statement is submitted in a single batch. GO is optional when the batch contains only one statement.

## Create a table

[!INCLUDE[sql-asdb-asa-pdw](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asa-pdw.md)]

To create a table, you must provide a name for the table, and the names and data types of each column in the table. It is also a good practice to indicate whether null values are allowed in each column. To create a table, you must have the `CREATE TABLE` permission, and the `ALTER SCHEMA` permission on the schema that will contain the table. The [db_ddladmin](../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/database-level-roles.md) fixed database role has these permissions.

Most tables have a primary key, made up of one or more columns of the table. A primary key is always unique. The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] enforces the restriction that any primary key value can't be repeated in the table.

For a list of data types and links for a description of each, see [Data Types (Transact-SQL)](../t-sql/data-types/data-types-transact-sql.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] can be installed as case sensitive or non-case sensitive. If the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] is installed as case sensitive, object names must always have the same case. For example, a table named OrderData is a different table from a table named ORDERDATA. If the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] is installed as non-case sensitive, those two table names are considered to be the same table, and that name can only be used one time.

### Switch the Query Editor connection to the TestData database

In a Query Editor window, type and execute the following code to change your connection to the `TestData` database.

```sql
USE TestData
GO
```

### Create the table

In a Query Editor window, type and execute the following code to create a table named `Products`. The columns in the table are named `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `Price`, and `ProductDescription`. The `ProductID` column is the primary key of the table. `int`, `varchar(25)`, `money`, and `varchar(max)` are all data types. Only the `Price` and `ProductionDescription` columns can have no data when a row is inserted or changed. This statement contains an optional element (`dbo.`) called a schema. The schema is the database object that owns the table. If you are an administrator, `dbo` is the default schema. `dbo` stands for database owner.

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.Products
    (ProductID int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    ProductName varchar(25) NOT NULL,
    Price money NULL,
    ProductDescription varchar(max) NULL)
GO
```

## Insert and update data in a table

Now that you have created the `Products` table, you are ready to insert data into the table by using the INSERT statement. After the data is inserted, you will change the content of a row by using an UPDATE statement. You use the WHERE clause of the UPDATE statement to restrict the update to a single row. The four statements enter the following data.

| ProductID | ProductName | Price | ProductDescription |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Clamp | 12.48 | Workbench clamp |
| 50 | Screwdriver | 3.17 | Flat head |
| 75 | Tire Bar | | Tool for changing tires. |
| 3000 | 3 mm Bracket | 0.52 | |

The basic syntax is: INSERT, table name, column list, VALUES, and then a list of the values to be inserted. The two hyphens in front of a line indicate that the line is a comment and the text is ignored by the compiler. In this case, the comment describes a permissible variation of the syntax.

### Insert data into a table

1. Execute the following statement to insert a row into the `Products` table that was created in the previous task.

   ```sql
   -- Standard syntax
   INSERT dbo.Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, ProductDescription)
       VALUES (1, 'Clamp', 12.48, 'Workbench clamp')
   GO
   ```

   If the insert succeeds, proceed to the next step.

   If the insert fails, it may be because the `Product` table already has a row with that product ID in it. To proceed, delete all the rows in the table and repeat the preceding step. [TRUNCATE TABLE](statements/truncate-table-transact-sql.md) deletes all the rows in the table.

   Run the following command to delete all the rows in the table:

   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE TestData.dbo.Products;
   GO
   ```

   After you truncate the table, repeat the `INSERT` command in this step.

1. The following statement shows how you can change the order in which the parameters are provided by switching the placement of the `ProductID` and `ProductName` in both the field list (in parentheses) and in the values list.

   ```sql
   -- Changing the order of the columns
   INSERT dbo.Products (ProductName, ProductID, Price, ProductDescription)
       VALUES ('Screwdriver', 50, 3.17, 'Flat head')
   GO
   ```

1. The following statement demonstrates that the names of the columns are optional, as long as the values are listed in the correct order. This syntax is common but isn't recommended because it might be harder for others to understand your code. `NULL` is specified for the `Price` column because the price for this product isn't yet known.

   ```sql
   -- Skipping the column list, but keeping the values in order
   INSERT dbo.Products
       VALUES (75, 'Tire Bar', NULL, 'Tool for changing tires.')
   GO
   ```

1. The schema name is optional as long as you are accessing and changing a table in your default schema. Because the `ProductDescription` column allows null values and no value is being provided, the `ProductDescription` column name and value can be dropped from the statement completely.

   ```sql
   -- Dropping the optional dbo and dropping the ProductDescription column
   INSERT Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price)
       VALUES (3000, '3 mm Bracket', 0.52)
   GO
   ```

### Update the products table

Type and execute the following `UPDATE` statement to change the `ProductName` of the second product from `Screwdriver`, to `Flat Head Screwdriver`.

  ```sql
  UPDATE dbo.Products
      SET ProductName = 'Flat Head Screwdriver'
      WHERE ProductID = 50
  GO
  ```

## Read data from a table

Use the SELECT statement to read the data in a table. The SELECT statement is one of the most important [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements, and there are many variations in the syntax. For this tutorial, you will work with five basic versions.

### Read the data in a table

1. Type and execute the following statements to read the data in the `Products` table.

   ```sql
   -- The basic syntax for reading data from a single table
   SELECT ProductID, ProductName, Price, ProductDescription
       FROM dbo.Products
   GO
   ```

1. You can use an asterisk (`*`) to select all the columns in the table. The asterisk is for ad hoc queries. In permanent code, provide the column list so that the statement returns the predicted columns, even if a new column is added to the table later.

   ```sql
   -- Returns all columns in the table
   -- Does not use the optional schema, dbo
   SELECT * FROM Products
   GO
   ```

1. You can omit columns that you don't want to return. The columns are returned in the order that they are listed.

   ```sql
   -- Returns only two of the columns from the table
   SELECT ProductName, Price
       FROM dbo.Products
   GO
   ```

1. Use a `WHERE` clause to limit the rows that are returned to the user.

   ``` sql
   -- Returns only two of the records in the table
   SELECT ProductID, ProductName, Price, ProductDescription
       FROM dbo.Products
       WHERE ProductID < 60
   GO
   ```

1. You can work with the values in the columns as they are returned. The following example performs a mathematical operation on the `Price` column. Columns that have been changed in this way don't have a name unless you provide one by using the `AS` keyword.

   ```sql
   -- Returns ProductName and the Price including a 7% tax
   -- Provides the name CustomerPays for the calculated column
   SELECT ProductName, Price * 1.07 AS CustomerPays
       FROM dbo.Products
   GO
   ```

## Create views and stored procedures

A view is a stored SELECT statement, and a stored procedure is one or more [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that execute as a batch.

Views are queried like tables and don't accept parameters. Stored procedures are more complex than views. Stored procedures can have both input and output parameters and can contain statements to control the flow of the code, such as IF and WHILE statements. It is good programming practice to use stored procedures for all repetitive actions in the database.

For this example, you use CREATE VIEW to create a view that selects only two of the columns in the `Products` table. Then, you use CREATE PROCEDURE to create a stored procedure that accepts a price parameter and returns only those products that cost less than the specified parameter value.

### Create a view

Execute the following statement to create a view that executes a select statement, and returns the names and prices of our products to the user.

  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW vw_Names
     AS
     SELECT ProductName, Price FROM Products;
  GO
  ```

### Test the view

Views are treated just like tables. Use a `SELECT` statement to access a view.

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM vw_Names;
  GO
  ```

### Create a stored procedure

The following statement creates a stored procedure name `pr_Names`, accepts an input parameter named `@VarPrice` of data type `money`. The stored procedure prints the statement `Products less than` concatenated with the input parameter that is changed from the `money` data type into a `varchar(10)` character data type. Then, the procedure executes a `SELECT` statement on the view, passing the input parameter as part of the `WHERE` clause. This returns all products that cost less than the input parameter value.

  ```sql
  CREATE PROCEDURE pr_Names @VarPrice money
     AS
     BEGIN
        -- The print statement returns text to the user
        PRINT 'Products less than ' + CAST(@VarPrice AS varchar(10));
        -- A second statement starts here
        SELECT ProductName, Price FROM vw_Names
              WHERE Price < @VarPrice;
     END
  GO
  ```

### Test the stored procedure

To test the stored procedure, type and execute the following statement. The procedure should return the names of the two products entered into the `Products` table in Lesson 1 with a price that is less than `10.00`.

  ```sql
  EXECUTE pr_Names 10.00;
  GO
  ```
