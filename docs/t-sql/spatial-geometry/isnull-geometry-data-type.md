# IsNull (geometry Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

The type of a **geometry** instance is null. Returns 0 if the instance isn't null.
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
.IsNull  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return Types
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] type: **bit**  
  
 CLR type: **SqlBoolean**  
  
## Remarks  
 `IsNull` can be used to test whether a **geometry** instance is null. `IsNull` returns 0 if the instance isn't null, but null if the instance is null.  
  
 This method is primarily used by the SQL Server infrastructure; it isn't recommended that you use `IsNull` to test whether an instance is null.
