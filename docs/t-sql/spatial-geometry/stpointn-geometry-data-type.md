# STPointN (geometry Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance FabricSE FabricDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Returns a specified point in a **geometry** instance.
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.STPointN ( expression )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *expression*  
 Is an **int** expression between 1 and the number of points in the **geometry** instance.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **geometry**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlGeometry**  
  
 Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) type: **Point**  
  
## Remarks  
 If a **geometry** instance is user created, `STPointN()` returns the point specified by *expression* by ordering the points in the order in which they were originally input.  
  
 If a **geometry** instance was constructed by the system, `STPointN()` returns the point specified by *expression* by ordering all the points in the same order they would be output: first by geometry, then by ring within the geometry (if appropriate), and then by point within the ring. This order is deterministic.  
  
 If this method is called with a value less than 1, it throws an **ArgumentOutOfRangeException**.  
  
 If this method is called with a value greater than the number of points in the instance, it returns null.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates a `LineString` instance and uses `STPointN()` to retrieve the second point in the description of the instance.  
  
```sql
DECLARE @g geometry;  
SET @g = geometry::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(0 0, 2 2, 1 0)', 0);  
SELECT @g.STPointN(2).ToString();  
```
