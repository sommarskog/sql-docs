# BufferWithTolerance (geometry Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Returns a geometric object that represents the union of all point values whose distance from a **geometry** instance is less than or equal to a specified value, allowing for a specified tolerance.
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.BufferWithTolerance ( distance, tolerance, relative )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *distance*  
 Is a **float** expression specifying the distance from the **geometry** instance around which to calculate the buffer.  
  
 *tolerance*  
 Is a **float** expression specifying the tolerance of the buffer distance.  
  
 *Tolerance* refers to the maximum variation in the ideal buffer distance for the returned linear approximation.  
  
 For example, the ideal buffer distance of a point is a circle, but this must be approximated by a polygon. The smaller the tolerance, the more points the polygon will have, which increases the complexity of the result, but decreases the error.  
  
 *relative*  
 Is a **bit** specifying whether the *tolerance* value is relative or absolute. If 'TRUE' or 1, then tolerance is relative and is calculated as the product of the *tolerance* parameter and the diameter of the bounding box of the instance. If 'FALSE' or 0, tolerance is absolute and the *tolerance* value is the absolute maximum variation in the ideal buffer distance for the returned linear approximation.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **geometry**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlGeometry**  
  
## Exceptions  
 The *tolerance* parameter must be greater than zero. If *tolerance* <= 0 then a `System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException` is thrown.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Since *tolerance* is a **float** type, a `System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException` can be thrown if the value given for tolerance is very small because of the rounding issues with floating point types.  
  
## Remarks  
 When *distance* > 0 then either a **Polygon** or **MultiPolygon** instance is returned.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Since distance is a **float**, an extremely small value can equate to zero in the calculations. When this occurs, a copy of the calling **geometry** instance is returned. See [float and real &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/data-types/float-and-real-transact-sql.md).  
  
 When *distance* = 0 then a copy of the calling **geometry** instance is returned.  
  
 When *distance* < 0 then  
  
-   An empty **GeometryCollection** instance is returned when the dimensions of the instance are 0 or 1.  
  
-   A negative buffer is returned when the dimensions of the instance are 2 or more.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  A negative buffer may also create an empty **GeometryCollection** instance.  
  
 A negative buffer removes all points within the given distance of the boundary of the **geometry** instance.  
  
 The error between the theoretical and computed buffer is max(tolerance, extents \* 1.E-7) where tolerance is the value of the *tolerance* parameter. For more information on extents, see [geometry Data Type Method Reference](./spatial-types-geometry-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates a `Point` instance and uses `BufferWithTolerance()` to obtain a rough buffer around it.  
  
```sql
DECLARE @g geometry;  
SET @g = geometry::STGeomFromText('POINT(3 3)', 0);  
SELECT @g.BufferWithTolerance(1, .5, 0).ToString();  
```
