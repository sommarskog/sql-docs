# STOverlaps (geometry Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance FabricSE FabricDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Returns 1 if a **geometry** instance overlaps another **geometry** instance. Returns 0 if it does not.
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.STOverlaps ( other_geometry )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *other_geometry*  
 Is another **geometry** instance to compare against the instance on which `STOverlaps()` is invoked.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **bit**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlBoolean**  
  
## Remarks  
 Two **geometry** instances overlap if the region representing their intersection has the same dimension as the instances do and the region does not equal either instance.  
  
 `STOverlaps()` always returns 0 if the points where the **geometry** instances intersect are not the same dimension.  
  
 This method always returns null if the spatial reference IDs (SRIDs) of the **geometry** instances do not match.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses `STOverlaps()` to test two **geometry** instances for overlap.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geometry;  
DECLARE @h geometry;  
SET @g = geometry::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((0 0, 2 0, 2 2, 0 2, 0 0))', 0);  
SET @h = geometry::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((1 1, 3 1, 3 3, 1 3, 1 1))', 0);  
SELECT @g.STOverlaps(@h);  
```
