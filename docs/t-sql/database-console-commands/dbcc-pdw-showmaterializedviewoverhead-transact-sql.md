# DBCC PDW_SHOWMATERIALIZEDVIEWOVERHEAD (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [asa](../../includes/applies-to-version/asa.md)]

Displays the number of incremental changes in the base tables that are held for materialized views in [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)]. The overhead ratio is calculated as TOTAL_ROWS / MAX (1, BASE_VIEW_ROWS).

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
DBCC PDW_SHOWMATERIALIZEDVIEWOVERHEAD ( "[ schema_name . ] materialized_view_name" )
[;]
```

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE[synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax](../../includes/synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax.md)]

## Arguments

#### *schema_name*

The name of the schema to which the view belongs.

#### *materialized_view_name*

The name of the materialized view.

## Remarks

To keep materialized views refreshed with data changes in base tables, data warehouse engine adds tracking rows to each affected view to reflect the changes. Selecting from a materialized view includes scanning the view's clustered columnstore index and applying any incremental changes.  The tracking rows (TOTAL_ROWS - BASE_VIEW_ROWS) don't get eliminated until users REBUILD the materialized view.

The overhead_ratio is calculated as TOTAL_ROWS / MAX(1, BASE_VIEW_ROWS). If it's high, SELECT performance will degrade. Users can rebuild the materialized view to reduce its overhead ratio.

## Permissions

Requires **VIEW DATABASE STATE** permission.

## Examples

### A. This example returns the overhead ratio of a materialized view.

```sql
DBCC PDW_SHOWMATERIALIZEDVIEWOVERHEAD ("dbo.MyIndexedView");
```

Sample output:

| OBJECT_ID | BASE_VIEW_ROWS | TOTAL_ROWS | OVERHEAD_RATIO |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1234 | 1 | 3 | 3.0 |

### B. This example shows how the materialized view overhead increases as data changes in base tables

Create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT NOT NULL, c2 INT NOT NULL, c3 INT NOT NULL);
```

Insert five rows into `t1`:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 1, 1);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (2, 2, 2);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (3, 3, 3);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (4, 4, 4);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (5, 5, 5);
```

Create materialized views MV1:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW MV1
WITH (DISTRIBUTION = HASH(c1))
AS
SELECT c1, COUNT(*) total_number
FROM dbo.t1 WHERE c1 < 3
GROUP BY c1;
```

Selecting from the materialized view returns two rows.

| c1 | total_number |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 |

Check the materialized view overhead before any data changes in the base table.

```sql
DBCC PDW_SHOWMATERIALIZEDVIEWOVERHEAD ("dbo.mv1")
```

Sample output:

| OBJECT_ID | BASE_VIEW_ROWS | TOTAL_ROWS | OVERHEAD_RATIO |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 587149137 | 2 | 2 | 1.00000000000000000 |

Update the base table. This query updates the same column in the same row 100 times to the same value. The materialized view content doesn't change.

```sql
DECLARE @p INT;
SELECT @p = 1;
WHILE (@p < 101)
BEGIN
    UPDATE t1 SET c1 = 1 WHERE c1 = 1;
    SELECT @p = @p + 1;
END;
```

Selecting from the materialized view returns the same result as before.

| c1 | total_number |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 |

Below is the output from `DBCC PDW_SHOWMATERIALIZEDVIEWOVERHEAD ("dbo.mv1")`. 100 rows are added to the materialized view (total_row - base_view_rows) and its overhead_ratio is increased.

| OBJECT_ID | BASE_VIEW_ROWS | TOTAL_ROWS | OVERHEAD_RATIO |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 587149137 | 2 | 102 | 51.00000000000000000 |

After rebuilding the materialized view, all tracking rows for incremental data changes are eliminated and the view overhead ratio is reduced.

```sql
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW dbo.MV1 REBUILD
GO
DBCC PDW_SHOWMATERIALIZEDVIEWOVERHEAD ("dbo.mv1")
```

Output

```output
| OBJECT_ID | BASE_VIEW_ROWS | TOTAL_ROWS | OVERHEAD_RATIO |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 587149137 | 2 | 2 | 1.00000000000000000 |
```
