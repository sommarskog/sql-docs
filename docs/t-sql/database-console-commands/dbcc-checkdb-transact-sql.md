# DBCC CHECKDB (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Checks the logical and physical integrity of all the objects in the specified database by performing the following operations:

- Runs [DBCC CHECKALLOC](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkalloc-transact-sql.md) on the database.
- Runs [DBCC CHECKTABLE](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checktable-transact-sql.md) on every table and view in the database.
- Runs [DBCC CHECKCATALOG](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkcatalog-transact-sql.md) on the database.
- Validates the contents of every indexed view in the database.
- Validates link-level consistency between table metadata and file system directories and files when storing **varbinary(max)** data in the file system using FILESTREAM.
- Validates the [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../includes/sssb-md.md)] data in the database.

This means that the `DBCC CHECKALLOC`, `DBCC CHECKTABLE`, or `DBCC CHECKCATALOG` commands don't have to be run separately from `DBCC CHECKDB`. For more detailed information about the checks that these commands perform, see the descriptions of these commands.

`DBCC CHECKDB` is supported on databases that contain memory-optimized tables but validation only occurs on disk-based tables. However, as part of database backup and recovery, a CHECKSUM validation is done for files in memory-optimized filegroups.

Since DBCC repair options aren't available for memory-optimized tables, you must back up your databases regularly and test the backups. If data integrity issues occur in a memory-optimized table, you must restore from the last known good backup.

```

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments

#### *database_name* | *database_id* | 0

The name or ID of the database for which to run integrity checks. If not specified, or if 0 is specified, the current database is used. Database names must comply with the rules for [identifiers](../../relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers.md).

#### NOINDEX

Specifies that intensive checks of nonclustered indexes for user tables won't be performed. This choice decreases the overall execution time. `NOINDEX` doesn't affect system tables because integrity checks are always performed on system table indexes.

#### REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS | REPAIR_FAST | REPAIR_REBUILD

Specifies that `DBCC CHECKDB` repairs the errors found. Use the REPAIR options only as a last resort. The specified database must be in single-user mode to use one of the following repair options.

- REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS

  Tries to repair all reported errors. These repairs can cause some data loss.

  > [!WARNING]  
  > The `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option is a supported feature but it may not always be the best option for bringing a database to a physically consistent state. If successful, the `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option may result in some data loss. In fact, it may result in more data lost than if a user were to restore the database from the last known good backup.

  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] always recommends a user restore from the last known good backup as the primary method to recover from errors reported by `DBCC CHECKDB`. The `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option isn't an alternative for restoring from a known good backup. It is an emergency **last resort** option recommended for use only if restoring from a backup isn't possible.

  Certain errors, that can only be repaired using the `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option, may involve deallocating a row, page, or series of pages to clear the errors. Any deallocated data is no longer accessible or recoverable for the user, and the exact contents of the deallocated data cannot be determined. Therefore, referential integrity may not be accurate after any rows or pages are deallocated because foreign key constraints are not checked or maintained as part of this repair operation. The user must inspect the referential integrity of their database (using `DBCC CHECKCONSTRAINTS`) after using the `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option.

  Before performing the repair, you must create physical copies of the files that belong to this database. This includes the primary data file (`.mdf`), any secondary data files (`.ndf`), all transaction log files (`.ldf`), and other containers that form the database including full text catalogs, file stream folders, memory optimized data, and so on.

  Before performing the repair, consider changing the state of the database to `EMERGENCY` mode and trying to extract as much information possible from the critical tables and save that data.

- REPAIR_FAST

  Maintains syntax for backward compatibility only. No repair actions are performed.

- REPAIR_REBUILD

  Performs repairs that have no possibility of data loss. This option may include quick repairs, such as repairing missing rows in nonclustered indexes, and more time-consuming repairs, such as rebuilding an index.

  This argument doesn't repair errors involving FILESTREAM data.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Since `DBCC CHECKDB` with any of the REPAIR options are completely logged and recoverable, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] always recommends a user use `DBCC CHECKDB` with any REPAIR options within a transaction (execute `BEGIN TRANSACTION` before running the command) so that the user can confirm that they want to accept the results of the operation. Then the user can execute `COMMIT TRANSACTION` to commit all work done by the repair operation. If the user does not want to accept the results of the operation, they can execute a `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` to undo the effects of the repair operations.
>  
> To repair errors, we recommend restoring from a backup. Repair operations do not consider any of the constraints that may exist on or between tables. If the specified table is involved in one or more constraints, we recommend running `DBCC CHECKCONSTRAINTS` after a repair operation. If you must use REPAIR, run `DBCC CHECKDB` without a repair option to find the repair level to use. If you use the `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` level, we recommend that you back up the database before you run `DBCC CHECKDB` with this option.

#### ALL_ERRORMSGS

Displays all reported errors per object. All error messages are displayed by default. Specifying or omitting this option has no effect. Error messages are sorted by object ID, except for those messages generated from [tempdb database](../../relational-databases/databases/tempdb-database.md).

#### EXTENDED_LOGICAL_CHECKS

If the compatibility level is 100, introduced in [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)], this option performs logical consistency checks on an indexed view, XML indexes, and spatial indexes, where present.

For more information, see [Perform logical consistency checks on indexes](#perform-logical-consistency-checks-on-indexes) later in this article.

#### NO_INFOMSGS

Suppresses all informational messages.

#### TABLOCK

Causes `DBCC CHECKDB` to obtain locks instead of using an internal database snapshot. This includes a short-term exclusive (X) lock on the database. `TABLOCK` will cause `DBCC CHECKDB` to run faster on a database under heavy load, but will decrease the concurrency available on the database while `DBCC CHECKDB` is running.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> `TABLOCK` limits the checks that are performed; `DBCC CHECKCATALOG` is not run on the database, and [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../includes/sssb-md.md)] data is not validated.

#### ESTIMATEONLY

Displays the estimated amount of `tempdb` space that is required to run `DBCC CHECKDB` with all the other specified options. The actual database check isn't performed.

#### PHYSICAL_ONLY

Limits the checking to the integrity of the physical structure of the page and record headers and the allocation consistency of the database. This check is designed to provide a small overhead check of the physical consistency of the database, but it can also detect torn pages, checksum failures, and common hardware failures that can compromise a user's data.

A full run of `DBCC CHECKDB` may take considerably longer to complete than earlier versions. This behavior occurs because:

- The logical checks are more comprehensive.
- Some of the underlying structures to be checked are more complex.
- Many new checks have been introduced to include the new features.

Therefore, using the `PHYSICAL_ONLY` option may cause a much shorter run-time for `DBCC CHECKDB` on large databases and is recommended for frequent use on production systems. We still recommend that a full run of `DBCC CHECKDB` be performed periodically. The frequency of these runs depends on factors specific to individual businesses and production environments.

This argument always implies `NO_INFOMSGS` and isn't allowed with any one of the repair options.

> [!WARNING]  
> Specifying `PHYSICAL_ONLY` causes `DBCC CHECKDB` to skip all checks of FILESTREAM data.

#### DATA_PURITY

Causes `DBCC CHECKDB` to check the database for column values that aren't valid or out-of-range. For example, `DBCC CHECKDB` detects columns with date and time values that are larger than or less than the acceptable range for the **datetime** data type; or **decimal** or approximate-numeric data type columns with scale or precision values that aren't valid.

Column-value integrity checks are enabled by default and don't require the `DATA_PURITY` option. For databases upgraded from earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], column-value checks aren't enabled by default until `DBCC CHECKDB WITH DATA_PURITY` has been run error free on the database. After this, `DBCC CHECKDB` checks column-value integrity by default. For more information about how `CHECKDB` might be affected by upgrading database from earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see the Remarks section later in this article.

> [!WARNING]  
> If `PHYSICAL_ONLY` is specified, column-integrity checks are not performed.

 Validation errors reported by this option can't be fixed by using DBCC repair options. For information about manually correcting these errors, see Knowledge Base article 923247: [Troubleshooting DBCC error 2570 in SQL Server 2005 and later versions](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/923247).

#### MAXDOP

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] Service Pack 2 and later versions

 Overrides the **max degree of parallelism** configuration option of `sp_configure` for the statement. The `MAXDOP` can exceed the value configured with `sp_configure`. If `MAXDOP` exceeds the value configured with Resource Governor, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] uses the Resource Governor `MAXDOP` value, described in [ALTER WORKLOAD GROUP](../../t-sql/statements/alter-workload-group-transact-sql.md). All semantic rules used with the max degree of parallelism configuration option are applicable when you use the `MAXDOP` query hint. For more information, see [Configure the max degree of parallelism Server Configuration Option](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option.md).

> [!WARNING]  
> If `MAXDOP` is set to zero then [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] chooses the max degree of parallelism to use.

## Remarks

`DBCC CHECKDB` doesn't examine disabled indexes. For more information about disabled indexes, see [Disable Indexes and Constraints](../../relational-databases/indexes/disable-indexes-and-constraints.md).

If a user-defined type is marked as being byte ordered, there must only be one serialization of the user-defined type. Not having a consistent serialization of byte-ordered user-defined types causes error 2537 when `DBCC CHECKDB` is run. For more information, see [User-Defined Type Requirements](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-user-defined-types/creating-user-defined-types-requirements.md).

Because the [Resource database](../../relational-databases/databases/resource-database.md) is modifiable only in single-user mode, the `DBCC CHECKDB` command can't be run on it directly. However, when `DBCC CHECKDB` is executed against the [master database](../../relational-databases/databases/master-database.md), a second `CHECKDB` is also run internally on the Resource database. This means that `DBCC CHECKDB` can return extra results. The command returns extra result sets when no options are set, or when either the `PHYSICAL_ONLY` or `ESTIMATEONLY` option is set.

Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] Service Pack 2, executing `DBCC CHECKDB` no longer clears the plan cache for the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Before [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] Service Pack 2, executing `DBCC CHECKDB` clears the plan cache. Clearing the plan cache causes recompilation of all later execution plans and may cause a sudden, temporary decrease in query performance.

## Perform logical consistency checks on indexes

Logical consistency checking on indexes varies according to the compatibility level of the database, as follows:

- If the compatibility level is at least 100 (introduced in [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)]):
- Unless `NOINDEX` is specified, `DBCC CHECKDB` performs both physical and logical consistency checks on a single table and on all its nonclustered indexes. However, on XML indexes, spatial indexes, and indexed views only physical consistency checks are performed by default.
- If `WITH EXTENDED_LOGICAL_CHECKS` is specified, logical checks are performed on an indexed view, XML indexes, and spatial indexes, where present. By default, physical consistency checks are performed before the logical consistency checks. If `NOINDEX` is also specified, only the logical checks are performed.

These logical consistency checks cross check the internal index table of the index object with the user table that it is referencing. To find outlying rows, an internal query is constructed to perform a full intersection of the internal and user tables. Running this query can have a significant effect on performance, and its progress can't be tracked. Therefore, we recommend that you specify `WITH EXTENDED_LOGICAL_CHECKS` only if you suspect index issues that are unrelated to physical corruption, or if page-level checksums have been turned off and you suspect column-level hardware corruption.

- If the index is a filtered index, `DBCC CHECKDB` performs consistency checks to verify that the index entries satisfy the filter predicate.
- If the compatibility level is 90 or less, unless `NOINDEX` is specified, `DBCC CHECKDB` performs both physical and logical consistency checks on a single table or indexed view and on all its nonclustered and XML indexes. Spatial indexes aren't supported.
- Starting with [!INCLUDE [sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)], additional checks on persisted computed columns, UDT columns, and filtered indexes won't run by default to avoid the expensive expression evaluations. This change greatly reduces the duration of `CHECKDB` against databases containing these objects. However, the physical consistency check of  these objects is always completed. Only when `EXTENDED_LOGICAL_CHECKS` option is specified, are the expression evaluations performed, in addition to the logical checks that are already present as part of the `EXTENDED_LOGICAL_CHECKS` option (indexed view, XML indexes, and spatial indexes).

## Internal database snapshot

`DBCC CHECKDB` uses an internal database snapshot for the transactional consistency needed to perform these checks. This prevents blocking and concurrency problems when these commands are executed. For more information, see [View the Size of the Sparse File of a Database Snapshot (Transact-SQL)](../../relational-databases/databases/view-the-size-of-the-sparse-file-of-a-database-snapshot-transact-sql.md) and the DBCC Internal Database Snapshot Usage section in [DBCC (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-transact-sql.md). If a snapshot can't be created, or `TABLOCK` is specified, `DBCC CHECKDB` acquires locks to obtain the required consistency. In this case, an exclusive database lock is required to perform the allocation checks, and shared table locks are required to perform the table checks.

`DBCC CHECKDB` fails when run against the `master` database if an internal database snapshot can't be created.

Running `DBCC CHECKDB` against `tempdb` doesn't perform any allocation or catalog checks and must acquire shared table locks to perform table checks. This is because, for performance reasons, database snapshots aren't available on `tempdb`. This means that the required transactional consistency can't be obtained.

### How DBCC CHECKDB creates an internal snapshot database beginning with SQL Server 2014

1. `DBCC CHECKDB` creates an internal snapshot database.

1. The internal snapshot database is created by using physical files. For example, for a database with `database_id = 10` that has three files `E:\Data\my_DB.mdf`, `E:\Data\my_DB.ndf`, and `E:\Data\my_DB.ldf`, the internal snapshot database will be created using `E:\Data\my_DB.mdf_MSSQL_DBCC11` and `E:\Data\my_DB.ndf_MSSQL_DBCC11` files. The `database_id` of the snapshot is `database_id + 1`. Also note that the new files are created in the same folder using the naming convention `<filename.extension>_MSSQL_DBCC<database_id_of_snapshot>`. No sparse file is created for the transaction log.

1. The new files are marked as [sparse files](/windows/win32/fileio/sparse-files) at the file system level. The *Size on Disk* used by the new files will increase based on how much data is updated in the source database during the `DBCC CHECKDB` command. The *Size* of the new files will be the same file as the `.mdf` or `.ndf` file.

1. The new files are deleted at the end of `DBCC CHECKDB` processing. These sparse files that are created by `DBCC CHECKDB` have the "Delete on Close" attributes set.

> [!WARNING]  
> If the operating system encounters an unexpected shutdown while the `DBCC CHECKDB` command is in progress, then these files will not be cleaned up. They will take up space, and can potentially cause failures on future `DBCC CHECKDB` executions. In that case, you can delete these new files after you confirm that there is no `DBCC CHECKDB` command currently being executed.

The new files are visible by using ordinary file utilities such as Windows Explorer.

> [!NOTE]  
> Prior to [!INCLUDE [sssql14-md](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)], named [file streams](/windows/win32/fileio/file-streams) were used instead to create the internal snapshot files. The named file streams used the format <filename.extension>:MSSQL_DBCC<database_id_of_snapshot>. Named file streams are not visible by using ordinary file utilities such as Windows Explorer. Therefore, in [!INCLUDE [sssql11-md](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and earlier versions, you may encounter error messages 7926 and 5030 when you run the `DBCC CHECKDB` command for database files located on an [ReFS](/windows-server/storage/refs/refs-overview)-formatted volume. This is because file streams cannot be created on [Resilient File System (RefS)](/windows-server/storage/refs/refs-overview). 

## Check and repair FILESTREAM data

When FILESTREAM is enabled for a database and table, you can optionally store **varbinary(max)** binary large objects (BLOBs) in the file system. When using `DBCC CHECKDB` on a database that stores BLOBs in the file system, DBCC checks link-level consistency between the file system and database.

For example, if a table contains a **varbinary(max)** column that uses the FILESTREAM attribute, `DBCC CHECKDB` will check that there is a one-to-one mapping between file system directories and files and table rows, columns, and column values. `DBCC CHECKDB` can repair corruption if you specify the `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option. To repair FILESTREAM corruption, DBCC will delete any table rows that are missing file system data.

## Best practices

We recommend that you use the `PHYSICAL_ONLY` option for frequent use on production systems. Using `PHYSICAL_ONLY` can greatly shorten run-time for `DBCC CHECKDB` on large databases. We also recommend that you periodically run `DBCC CHECKDB` with no options. How frequently you should perform these runs depends on individual businesses and their production environments.

## Check objects in parallel

By default, `DBCC CHECKDB` performs parallel checking of objects. The degree of parallelism is automatically determined by the query processor. The maximum degree of parallelism is configured just like parallel queries. To restrict the maximum number of processors available for DBCC checking, use [sp_configure](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql.md). For more information, see [Configure the max degree of parallelism Server Configuration Option](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option.md). Parallel checking can be disabled by using Trace Flag 2528. For more information, see [Trace Flags (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> This feature is not available in every edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see parallel consistency check in the [RDBMS manageability](../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022.md#rdbms-manageability) section of [Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2022](../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022.md).

## Understand DBCC error messages

After the `DBCC CHECKDB` command finishes, a message is written to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error log. If the DBCC command successfully executes, the message indicates success and the amount of time that the command ran. If the DBCC command stops before completing the check because of an error, the message indicates that the command was terminated, a state value, and the amount of time the command ran. The following table lists and describes the state values that can be included in the message.

| State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Error number 8930 was raised. This indicates a corruption in metadata that terminated the DBCC command. |
| 1 | Error number 8967 was raised. There was an internal DBCC error. |
| 2 | A failure occurred during emergency mode database repair. |
| 3 | This indicates a corruption in metadata that terminated the DBCC command. |
| 4 | An assert or access violation was detected. |
| 5 | An unknown error occurred that terminated the DBCC command. |

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] records the date and time when a consistency check was run for a database with no errors (or "clean" consistency check). This is known as the `last known clean check`. When a database is first started, this date is written to the EventLog (EventID-17573) and error log in the following format:  
>  
> `CHECKDB for database '<database>' finished without errors on 2022-05-05 18:08:22.803 (local time). This is an informational message only; no user action is required.`

## Error reporting

A dump file (`SQLDUMP<nnnn>.txt`) is created in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] `LOG` directory whenever `DBCC CHECKDB` detects a corruption error. When the *Feature Usage* data collection and *Error Reporting* features are enabled for the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the file is automatically forwarded to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)]. The collected data is used to improve [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] functionality.
The dump file contains the results of the `DBCC CHECKDB` command and additional diagnostic output. Access is limited to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service account and members of the sysadmin role. By default, the sysadmin role contains all members of the Windows `BUILTIN\Administrators` group and the local administrator's group. The DBCC command doesn't fail if the data collection process fails.

## Resolve errors

If any errors are reported by `DBCC CHECKDB`, we recommend restoring the database from the database backup instead of running REPAIR with one of the REPAIR options. If no backup exists, running repair corrects the errors reported. The repair option to use is specified at the end of the list of reported errors. However, correcting the errors by using the `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option might require deleting some pages, and therefore some data.

Under some circumstances, values might be entered into the database that aren't valid or out-of-range based on the data type of the column. `DBCC CHECKDB` can detect column values that aren't valid for all column data types. Therefore, running `DBCC CHECKDB` with the `DATA_PURITY` option on databases that have been upgraded from earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] might reveal preexisting column-value errors. Because [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can't automatically repair these errors, the column value must be manually updated. If `CHECKDB` detects such an error, `CHECKDB` returns a warning, the error number 2570, and information to identify the affected row and manually correct the error.

The repair can be performed under a user transaction to let the user roll back the changes that were made. If repairs are rolled back, the database will still contain errors and must be restored from a backup. After repairs are completed, back up the database.

## <a id="resolving-errors-in-database-emergency-mode"></a> Resolve errors in database emergency mode

When a database has been set to emergency mode by using the [ALTER DATABASE](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql.md) statement, `DBCC CHECKDB` can perform some special repairs on the database if the `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option is specified. These repairs may allow for ordinarily unrecoverable databases to be brought back online in a physically consistent state. These repairs should be used as a last resort and only when you can't restore the database from a backup. When the database is set to emergency mode, the database is marked READ_ONLY, logging is disabled, and access is limited to members of the sysadmin fixed server role.

> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot run the `DBCC CHECKDB` command in emergency mode inside a user transaction and roll back the transaction after execution.

When the database is in emergency mode and `DBCC CHECKDB` with the `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` clause is run, the following actions are taken:

- `DBCC CHECKDB` uses pages that have been marked inaccessible because of I/O or checksum errors, as if the errors haven't occurred. Doing this increases the chances for data recovery from the database.
- `DBCC CHECKDB` attempts to recover the database using regular log-based recovery techniques.
- If database recovery is unsuccessful because of transaction log corruption, the transaction log is rebuilt. Rebuilding the transaction log may result in the loss of transactional consistency.

> [!WARNING]  
> The `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option is a supported feature of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. However, it may not always be the best option for bringing a database to a physically consistent state. If successful, the `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option may result in some data loss.
> In fact, it may result in more data lost than if a user were to restore the database from the last known good backup. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] always recommends a user restore from the last known good backup as the primary method to recover from errors reported by `DBCC CHECKDB`.
> The `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option is **not** an alternative for restoring from a known good backup. It is an emergency **last resort** option recommended for use only if restoring from a backup is **not** possible.
>  
> After rebuilding the log, there is no full ACID guarantee.
>  
> After rebuilding the log, `DBCC CHECKDB` will be automatically performed and will both report and correct physical consistency issues.
>  
> Logical data consistency and business logic enforced constraints must be validated manually.

If the `DBCC CHECKDB` command succeeds, the database is in a physically consistent state, and the database status is set to ONLINE. However, the database may contain one or more transactional inconsistencies. We recommend that you run [DBCC CHECKCONSTRAINTS](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkconstraints-transact-sql.md) to identify any business logic flaws and immediately back up the database.
If the `DBCC CHECKDB` command fails, the database can't be repaired.

## Run DBCC CHECKDB with REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS in replicated databases

Running the `DBCC CHECKDB` command with the `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option can affect user databases (publication and subscription databases) and the distribution database used by replication. Publication and subscription databases include published tables and replication metadata tables. Be aware of the following potential issues in these databases:

- Published tables. Actions performed by the `CHECKDB` process to repair corrupt user data might not be replicated:
- Merge replication uses triggers to track changes to published tables. If rows are inserted, updated, or deleted by the `CHECKDB` process, triggers don't fire; therefore, the change isn't replicated.
- Transactional replication uses the transaction log to track changes to published tables. The Log Reader Agent then moves these changes to the distribution database. Some DBCC repairs, although logged, can't be replicated by the Log Reader Agent. For example, if a data page is deallocated by the `CHECKDB` process, the Log Reader Agent doesn't translate this deallocation to a DELETE statement; therefore, the change isn't replicated.
- Replication metadata tables. Actions performed by the `CHECKDB` process to repair corrupt replication metadata tables require removing and reconfiguring replication.

If you have to run the `DBCC CHECKDB` command with the `REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS` option on a user database or distribution database:

1. Quiesce the system: Stop activity on the database and at all other databases in the replication topology, and then try to synchronize all nodes. For more information, see [Quiesce a Replication Topology (Replication Transact-SQL Programming)](../../relational-databases/replication/administration/quiesce-a-replication-topology-replication-transact-sql-programming.md).
1. Execute `DBCC CHECKDB`.
1. If the `DBCC CHECKDB` report includes repairs for any tables in the distribution database or any replication metadata tables in a user database, remove and reconfigure replication. For more information, see [Disable Publishing and Distribution](../../relational-databases/replication/disable-publishing-and-distribution.md).
1. If the `DBCC CHECKDB` report includes repairs for any replicated tables, perform data validation to determine whether there are differences between the data in the publication and subscription databases.

## Permissions

Requires membership in the sysadmin fixed server role or the db_owner fixed database role.

## Examples

### A. Check both the current and another database

The following example executes `DBCC CHECKDB` for the current database and for the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.

```sql
-- Check the current database.
DBCC CHECKDB;
GO
-- Check the AdventureWorks2022 database without nonclustered indexes.
DBCC CHECKDB (AdventureWorks2022, NOINDEX);
GO
```

### B. Check the current database, suppressing informational messages

The following example checks the current database and suppresses all informational messages.

```sql
DBCC CHECKDB WITH NO_INFOMSGS;
GO
```
