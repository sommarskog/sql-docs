# CASE (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Evaluates a list of conditions and returns one of multiple possible result expressions.

The `CASE` expression has two formats:

- The simple `CASE` expression compares an expression to a set of simple expressions to determine the result.

- The searched `CASE` expression evaluates a set of Boolean expressions to determine the result.

Both formats support an optional ELSE argument.

`CASE` can be used in any statement or clause that allows a valid expression. For example, you can use `CASE` in statements such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE and SET, and in clauses such as *<select_list>*, IN, WHERE, ORDER BY, and HAVING.

```syntaxsql
-- Simple CASE expression:
CASE input_expression
     WHEN when_expression THEN result_expression [ ...n ]
     [ ELSE else_result_expression ]
END

-- Searched CASE expression:
CASE
     WHEN Boolean_expression THEN result_expression [ ...n ]
     [ ELSE else_result_expression ]
END
```

Syntax for Parallel Data Warehouse.

```syntaxsql
CASE
     WHEN when_expression THEN result_expression [ ...n ]
     [ ELSE else_result_expression ]
END
```

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments

#### *input_expression*

The expression evaluated when the simple `CASE` format is used. *input_expression* is any valid [expression](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md).

#### WHEN *when_expression*

A simple expression to which *input_expression* is compared when the simple `CASE` format is used. *when_expression* is any valid expression. The data types of *input_expression* and each *when_expression* must be the same or must be an implicit conversion.

#### THEN *result_expression*

The expression returned when *input_expression* equals *when_expression* evaluates to TRUE, or *Boolean_expression* evaluates to TRUE. *result expression* is any valid [expression](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md).

#### ELSE *else_result_expression*

The expression returned if no comparison operation evaluates to TRUE. If this argument is omitted and no comparison operation evaluates to TRUE, `CASE` returns NULL. *else_result_expression* is any valid expression. The data types of *else_result_expression* and any *result_expression* must be the same or must be an implicit conversion.

#### WHEN *Boolean_expression*

The Boolean expression evaluated when using the searched `CASE` format. *Boolean_expression* is any valid Boolean expression.

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return types

Returns the highest precedence type from the set of types in *result_expressions* and the optional *else_result_expression*. For more information, see [Data Type Precedence (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/data-types/data-type-precedence-transact-sql.md).

### Return values

**Simple CASE expression:**

The simple `CASE` expression operates by comparing the first expression to the expression in each WHEN clause for equivalency. If these expressions are equivalent, the expression in the THEN clause will be returned.

- Allows only an equality check.

- In the order specified, evaluates input_expression = when_expression for each WHEN clause.

- Returns the *result_expression* of the first *input_expression* = *when_expression* that evaluates to TRUE.

- If no *input_expression* = *when_expression* evaluates to TRUE, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] returns the *else_result_expression* if an ELSE clause is specified, or a NULL value if no ELSE clause is specified.

**Searched CASE expression:**

- Evaluates, in the order specified, *Boolean_expression* for each WHEN clause.

- Returns *result_expression* of the first *Boolean_expression* that evaluates to TRUE.

- If no *Boolean_expression* evaluates to TRUE, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] returns the *else_result_expression* if an ELSE clause is specified, or a NULL value if no ELSE clause is specified.

## Remarks

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] allows for only 10 levels of nesting in `CASE` expressions.

The `CASE` expression can't be used to control the flow of execution of Transact-SQL statements, statement blocks, user-defined functions, and stored procedures. For a list of control-of-flow methods, see [Control-of-Flow Language (Transact-SQL)](~/t-sql/language-elements/control-of-flow.md).

The `CASE` expression evaluates its conditions sequentially and stops with the first condition whose condition is satisfied. In some situations, an expression is evaluated before a `CASE` expression receives the results of the expression as its input. Errors in evaluating these expressions are possible. Aggregate expressions that appear in WHEN arguments to a `CASE` expression are evaluated first, then provided to the `CASE` expression. For example, the following query produces a divide by zero error when producing the value of the MAX aggregate. This occurs prior to evaluating the `CASE` expression.

```sql
WITH Data (value)
AS (
    SELECT 0
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 1
    )
SELECT CASE
        WHEN MIN(value) <= 0 THEN 0
        WHEN MAX(1 / value) >= 100 THEN 1
        END
FROM Data;
GO
```

You should only depend on order of evaluation of the WHEN conditions for scalar expressions (including non-correlated subqueries that return scalars), not for aggregate expressions.

You must also ensure that at least one of the expressions in the THEN or ELSE clauses isn't the NULL constant. While NULL can be returned from multiple result expressions, not all of these can explicitly be the NULL constant. If all result expressions use the NULL constant, error 8133 is returned.

## Examples

### A. Use a SELECT statement with a simple CASE expression

Within a `SELECT` statement, a simple `CASE` expression allows for only an equality check; no other comparisons are made. The following example uses the `CASE` expression to change the display of product line categories to make them more understandable.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

SELECT ProductNumber,
    Category = CASE ProductLine
        WHEN 'R' THEN 'Road'
        WHEN 'M' THEN 'Mountain'
        WHEN 'T' THEN 'Touring'
        WHEN 'S' THEN 'Other sale items'
        ELSE 'Not for sale'
        END,
    Name
FROM Production.Product
ORDER BY ProductNumber;
GO
```

### B. Use a SELECT statement with a searched CASE expression

Within a `SELECT` statement, the searched `CASE` expression allows for values to be replaced in the result set based on comparison values. The following example displays the list price as a text comment based on the price range for a product.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

SELECT ProductNumber,
    Name,
    "Price Range" = CASE
        WHEN ListPrice = 0 THEN 'Mfg item - not for resale'
        WHEN ListPrice < 50 THEN 'Under $50'
        WHEN ListPrice >= 50 AND ListPrice < 250 THEN 'Under $250'
        WHEN ListPrice >= 250 AND ListPrice < 1000 THEN 'Under $1000'
        ELSE 'Over $1000'
        END
FROM Production.Product
ORDER BY ProductNumber;
GO
```

### C. Use CASE in an ORDER BY clause

The following examples use the `CASE` expression in an ORDER BY clause to determine the sort order of the rows based on a given column value. In the first example, the value in the `SalariedFlag` column of the `HumanResources.Employee` table is evaluated. Employees that have the `SalariedFlag` set to 1 are returned in order by the `BusinessEntityID` in descending order. Employees that have the `SalariedFlag` set to 0 are returned in order by the `BusinessEntityID` in ascending order. In the second example, the result set is ordered by the column `TerritoryName` when the column `CountryRegionName` is equal to 'United States' and by `CountryRegionName` for all other rows.

```sql
SELECT BusinessEntityID,
    SalariedFlag
FROM HumanResources.Employee
ORDER BY CASE SalariedFlag
        WHEN 1 THEN BusinessEntityID
        END DESC,
    CASE
        WHEN SalariedFlag = 0 THEN BusinessEntityID
        END;
GO
```

```sql
SELECT BusinessEntityID,
    LastName,
    TerritoryName,
    CountryRegionName
FROM Sales.vSalesPerson
WHERE TerritoryName IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY CASE CountryRegionName
        WHEN 'United States' THEN TerritoryName
        ELSE CountryRegionName
        END;
GO
```

### D. Use CASE in an UPDATE statement

The following example uses the `CASE` expression in an UPDATE statement to determine the value that is set for the column `VacationHours` for employees with `SalariedFlag` set to 0. When subtracting 10 hours from `VacationHours` results in a negative value, `VacationHours` is increased by 40 hours; otherwise, `VacationHours` is increased by 20 hours. The OUTPUT clause is used to display the before and after vacation values.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

UPDATE HumanResources.Employee
SET VacationHours = (
        CASE
            WHEN ((VacationHours - 10.00) < 0) THEN VacationHours + 40
            ELSE (VacationHours + 20.00)
            END
        )
OUTPUT Deleted.BusinessEntityID,
    Deleted.VacationHours AS BeforeValue,
    Inserted.VacationHours AS AfterValue
WHERE SalariedFlag = 0;
GO
```

### E. Use CASE in a SET statement

The following example uses the `CASE` expression in a SET statement in the table-valued function `dbo.GetContactInfo`. In the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database, all data related to people is stored in the `Person.Person` table. For example, the person may be an employee, vendor representative, or a customer. The function returns the first and last name of a given `BusinessEntityID` and the contact type for that person. The `CASE` expression in the SET statement determines the value to display for the column `ContactType` based on the existence of the `BusinessEntityID` column in the `Employee`, `Vendor`, or `Customer` tables.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetContactInformation (@BusinessEntityID INT)
RETURNS @retContactInformation TABLE (
    BusinessEntityID INT NOT NULL,
    FirstName NVARCHAR(50) NULL,
    LastName NVARCHAR(50) NULL,
    ContactType NVARCHAR(50) NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (BusinessEntityID ASC)
    )
AS
-- Returns the first name, last name and contact type for the specified contact.
BEGIN
    DECLARE @FirstName NVARCHAR(50),
        @LastName NVARCHAR(50),
        @ContactType NVARCHAR(50);

    -- Get common contact information
    SELECT @BusinessEntityID = BusinessEntityID,
        @FirstName = FirstName,
        @LastName = LastName
    FROM Person.Person
    WHERE BusinessEntityID = @BusinessEntityID;

    SET @ContactType = CASE
            -- Check for employee
            WHEN EXISTS (
                    SELECT *
                    FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e
                    WHERE e.BusinessEntityID = @BusinessEntityID
                    )
                THEN 'Employee'
                    -- Check for vendor
            WHEN EXISTS (
                    SELECT *
                    FROM Person.BusinessEntityContact AS bec
                    WHERE bec.BusinessEntityID = @BusinessEntityID
                    )
                THEN 'Vendor'
                    -- Check for store
            WHEN EXISTS (
                    SELECT *
                    FROM Purchasing.Vendor AS v
                    WHERE v.BusinessEntityID = @BusinessEntityID
                    )
                THEN 'Store Contact'
                    -- Check for individual consumer
            WHEN EXISTS (
                    SELECT *
                    FROM Sales.Customer AS c
                    WHERE c.PersonID = @BusinessEntityID
                    )
                THEN 'Consumer'
            END;

    -- Return the information to the caller
    IF @BusinessEntityID IS NOT NULL
    BEGIN
        INSERT @retContactInformation
        SELECT @BusinessEntityID,
            @FirstName,
            @LastName,
            @ContactType;
    END;

    RETURN;
END;
GO

SELECT BusinessEntityID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    ContactType
FROM dbo.GetContactInformation(2200);
GO

SELECT BusinessEntityID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    ContactType
FROM dbo.GetContactInformation(5);
GO
```

### F. Use CASE in a HAVING clause

The following example uses the `CASE` expression in a HAVING clause to restrict the rows returned by the SELECT statement. The statement returns the hourly rate for each job title in the `HumanResources.Employee` table. The HAVING clause restricts the titles to those that are held by salaried employees with a maximum pay rate greater than 40 dollars, or non-salaried employees with a maximum pay rate greater than 15 dollars.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

SELECT JobTitle,
    MAX(ph1.Rate) AS MaximumRate
FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e
INNER JOIN HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory AS ph1
    ON e.BusinessEntityID = ph1.BusinessEntityID
GROUP BY JobTitle
HAVING (
        MAX(CASE
                WHEN SalariedFlag = 1 THEN ph1.Rate
                ELSE NULL
                END) > 40.00
        OR MAX(CASE
                WHEN SalariedFlag = 0 THEN ph1.Rate
                ELSE NULL
                END) > 15.00
        )
ORDER BY MaximumRate DESC;
GO
```

### G. Use a SELECT statement with a CASE expression

Within a SELECT statement, the `CASE` expression allows for values to be replaced in the result set based on comparison values. The following example uses the `CASE` expression to change the display of product line categories to make them more understandable. When a value doesn't exist, the text "Not for sale' is displayed.

```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorks

SELECT ProductAlternateKey,
    Category = CASE ProductLine
        WHEN 'R' THEN 'Road'
        WHEN 'M' THEN 'Mountain'
        WHEN 'T' THEN 'Touring'
        WHEN 'S' THEN 'Other sale items'
        ELSE 'Not for sale'
        END,
    EnglishProductName
FROM dbo.DimProduct
ORDER BY ProductKey;
GO
```

### H. Use CASE in an UPDATE statement

The following example uses the `CASE` expression in an UPDATE statement to determine the value that is set for the column `VacationHours` for employees with `SalariedFlag` set to 0. When subtracting 10 hours from `VacationHours` results in a negative value, `VacationHours` is increased by 40 hours; otherwise, `VacationHours` is increased by 20 hours.

```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorks

UPDATE dbo.DimEmployee
SET VacationHours = (
        CASE
            WHEN ((VacationHours - 10.00) < 0) THEN VacationHours + 40
            ELSE (VacationHours + 20.00)
            END
        )
WHERE SalariedFlag = 0;
GO
```
