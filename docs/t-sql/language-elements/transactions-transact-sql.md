# Transactions (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  A transaction is a single unit of work. If a transaction is successful, all of the data modifications made during the transaction are committed and become a permanent part of the database. If a transaction encounters errors and must be canceled or rolled back, then all of the data modifications are erased.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] operates in the following transaction modes:  
  
 Autocommit transactions  
 Each individual statement is a transaction.  
  
 Explicit transactions  
 Each transaction is explicitly started with the BEGIN TRANSACTION statement and explicitly ended with a COMMIT or ROLLBACK statement.  
  
 Implicit transactions  
 A new transaction is implicitly started when the prior transaction completes, but each transaction is explicitly completed with a COMMIT or ROLLBACK statement.  
  
 Batch-scoped transactions  
 Applicable only to multiple active result sets (MARS), a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] explicit or implicit transaction that starts under a MARS session becomes a batch-scoped transaction. A batch-scoped transaction that is not committed or rolled back when a batch completes is automatically rolled back by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
