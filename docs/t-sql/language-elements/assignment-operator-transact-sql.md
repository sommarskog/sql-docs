# = (Assignment Operator) (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance Azure Synapse Analytics Parallel Data Warehouse fabricse fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

  The equal sign (=) is the only [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] assignment operator. In the following example, the `@MyCounter` variable is created, and then the assignment operator sets `@MyCounter` to a value returned by an expression.  
  
```sql  
DECLARE @MyCounter INT;  
SET @MyCounter = 1;  
```  
  
 The assignment operator can also be used to establish the relationship between a column heading and the expression that defines the values for the column. The following example displays the column headings `FirstColumnHeading` and `SecondColumnHeading`. The string `xyz` is displayed in the `FirstColumnHeading` column heading for all rows. Then, each product ID from the `Product` table is listed in the `SecondColumnHeading` column heading.  
  
```sql  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT FirstColumnHeading = 'xyz',  
       SecondColumnHeading = ProductID  
FROM Production.Product;  
GO  
```
