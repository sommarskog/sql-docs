# Backslash (Line Continuation) (Transact-SQL)

 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql  
<first section of string> \  
<continued section of string>  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 \<first section of string>  
 Is the start of a string.  
  
 \<continued section of string>  
 Is the continuation of a string.  
  
## Remarks  
This command returns the first and continued sections of the string as one string, without the backslash. The new line after the backslash must either be a line feed character (U+000A) or a combination of carriage return (U+000D) and line feed (U+000A) in that order. 

## Examples  

### A. Splitting a character string  

The following example uses a backslash and a carriage return to split a character string into two lines.  
  
```sql  
SELECT 'abc\  
def' AS [ColumnResult];  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 ```  
 ColumnResult  
 ------------  
 abcdef
 ```    

### B. Splitting a binary string  

The following example uses a backslash and a carriage return to split a binary string into two lines.  

```sql  
SELECT 0xabc\
def AS [ColumnResult];  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 ```  
 ColumnResult  
 ------------  
 0xABCDEF
 ```
