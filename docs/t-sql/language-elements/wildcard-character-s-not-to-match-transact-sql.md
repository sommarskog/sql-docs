# \[^\] (Wildcard - Character(s) Not to Match) (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Matches any single character that is not within the range or set specified between the square brackets `[^]`. These wildcard characters can be used in string comparisons that involve pattern matching, such as `LIKE` and `PATINDEX`. 
  
## Examples  
### A: Simple example   
 The following example uses the [^] operator to find the top 5 people in the `Contact` table who have a first name that starts with `Al` and has a third letter that is not the letter `a`.  
  
```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT TOP 5 FirstName, LastName  
FROM Person.Person  
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'Al[^a]%';  
```  
[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  

```
FirstName     LastName
---------     --------
Alex          Adams
Alexandra     Adams
Allison       Adams
Alisha        Alan
Alexandra     Alexander
```
### B: Searching for ranges of characters

A wildcard set can include single characters or ranges of characters as well as combinations of characters and ranges. The following example uses the [^] operator to find a string that does not begin with a letter or number.

```sql
SELECT [object_id], OBJECT_NAME(object_id) AS [object_name], name, column_id 
FROM sys.columns 
WHERE name LIKE '[^0-9A-z]%';
```

[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  

```
object_id     object_name   name    column_id
---------     -----------   ----    ---------
1591676718    JunkTable     _xyz    1
```
