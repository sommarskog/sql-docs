# BEGIN...END (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

  Encloses a series of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements so that a group of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements can be executed. BEGIN and END are control-of-flow language keywords.  
  
 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
BEGIN  
    { sql_statement | statement_block }   
END  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 { *sql_statement* | *statement_block* }  
 Is any valid [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement or statement grouping as defined by using a statement block.  
  
## Remarks  
 BEGIN...END blocks can be nested.  
  
 Although all [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements are valid within a BEGIN...END block, certain [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements should not be grouped together within the same batch, or statement block.  
  
## Examples  
 In the following example, `BEGIN` and `END` define a series of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that execute together. If the `BEGIN...END` block were not included, both `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` statements would execute and both `PRINT` messages would be returned.  
  
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO  
BEGIN TRANSACTION
GO  
IF @@TRANCOUNT = 0  
BEGIN  
    SELECT FirstName, MiddleName   
    FROM Person.Person WHERE LastName = 'Adams';
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
    PRINT N'Rolling back the transaction two times would cause an error.';
END;
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
PRINT N'Rolled back the transaction.';
GO  
/*  
Rolled back the transaction.  
*/  
```  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
 In the following example, `BEGIN` and `END` define a series of [!INCLUDE[DWsql](../../includes/dwsql-md.md)] statements that run together. If the `BEGIN...END` block are not included, the following example will be in a continuous loop.  
  
```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorks  

DECLARE @Iteration Integer = 0;
WHILE @Iteration <10  
BEGIN  
    SELECT FirstName, MiddleName   
    FROM dbo.DimCustomer WHERE LastName = 'Adams';
    SET @Iteration += 1  ;
END;
```
