# Slash Star (Block Comment) (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

  Indicates user-provided text. The text between the `/*` and `*/` is not evaluated by the server.  
  
 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
/*  
text_of_comment  
*/  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *text_of_comment*  
 Is the text of the comment. This is one or more character strings.  
  
## Remarks  
 Comments can be inserted on a separate line or within a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement. Multiple-line comments must be indicated by /* and \*/. A stylistic convention often used for multiple-line comments is to begin the first line with /\*, subsequent lines with \*\*, and end with \*/.  
  
 There is no maximum length for comments.  
  
 Nested comments are supported. If the /* character pattern occurs anywhere within an existing comment, it is treated as the start of a nested comment and, therefore, requires a closing \*/ comment mark. If the closing comment mark does not exist, an error is generated.  
  
 For example, the following code generates an error.  
  
```sql  
DECLARE @comment AS VARCHAR(20);  
GO  
/*  
SELECT @comment = '/*';  
*/   
SELECT @@VERSION;  
GO   
```  
  
 To work around this error, make the following change.  
  
```sql  
DECLARE @comment AS VARCHAR(20);  
GO  
/*  
SELECT @comment = '/*';  
*/ */  
SELECT @@VERSION;  
GO  
```  
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses comments to explain what the section of the code is supposed to do.  
  
```sql  
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
GO  
/*  
This section of the code joins the Person table with the Address table,   
by using the Employee and BusinessEntityAddress tables in the middle to   
get a list of all the employees in the AdventureWorks2022 database   
and their contact information.  
*/  
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, a.AddressLine1, a.AddressLine2, a.City, a.PostalCode  
FROM Person.Person AS p  
JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID   
JOIN Person.BusinessEntityAddress AS ea ON e.BusinessEntityID = ea.BusinessEntityID  
JOIN Person.Address AS a ON ea.AddressID = a.AddressID;  
GO  
```
