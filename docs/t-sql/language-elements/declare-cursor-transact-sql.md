# DECLARE CURSOR (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Defines the attributes of a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] server cursor, such as its scrolling behavior and the query used to build the result set on which the cursor operates. `DECLARE CURSOR` accepts both a syntax based on the ISO standard and a syntax using a set of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] extensions.

## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
ISO Syntax  
DECLARE cursor_name [ INSENSITIVE ] [ SCROLL ] CURSOR   
     FOR select_statement   
     [ FOR { READ ONLY | UPDATE [ OF column_name [ ,...n ] ] } ]  
[;]  
Transact-SQL Extended Syntax  
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR [ LOCAL | GLOBAL ]   
     [ FORWARD_ONLY | SCROLL ]   
     [ STATIC | KEYSET | DYNAMIC | FAST_FORWARD ]   
     [ READ_ONLY | SCROLL_LOCKS | OPTIMISTIC ]   
     [ TYPE_WARNING ]   
     FOR select_statement   
     [ FOR UPDATE [ OF column_name [ ,...n ] ] ]  
[;]  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *cursor_name*  
 Is the name of the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] server cursor defined. *cursor_name* must conform to the rules for identifiers.  
  
 INSENSITIVE  
 Defines a cursor that makes a temporary copy of the data to be used by the cursor. All requests to the cursor are answered from this temporary table in **tempdb**; therefore, modifications made to base tables are not reflected in the data returned by fetches made to this cursor, and this cursor does not allow modifications. When ISO syntax is used, if `INSENSITIVE` is omitted, committed deletes and updates made to the underlying tables (by any user) are reflected in subsequent fetches.  
  
 SCROLL  
 Specifies that all fetch options (`FIRST`, `LAST`, `PRIOR`, `NEXT`, `RELATIVE`, `ABSOLUTE`) are available. If `SCROLL` is not specified in an ISO `DECLARE CURSOR`, `NEXT` is the only fetch option supported. `SCROLL` cannot be specified if `FAST_FORWARD` is also specified. If `SCROLL` is not specified   then only the fetch option `NEXT` is available and the cursor becomes `FORWARD_ONLY`.
  
 *select_statement*  
 Is a standard `SELECT` statement that defines the result set of the cursor. The keywords `FOR BROWSE`, and `INTO` are not allowed within *select_statement* of a cursor declaration.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] implicitly converts the cursor to another type if clauses in *select_statement* conflict with the functionality of the requested cursor type.  
  
 READ ONLY  
 Prevents updates made through this cursor. The cursor cannot be referenced in a `WHERE CURRENT OF` clause in an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement. This option overrides the default capability of a cursor to be updated.  
  
 UPDATE [OF *column_name* [**,**...*n*]]  
 Defines updatable columns within the cursor. If OF <column_name> [, <... n>] is specified, only the columns listed allow modifications. If `UPDATE` is specified without a column list, all columns can be updated.  
  
*cursor_name*  
Is the name of the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] server cursor defined. *cursor_name* must conform to the rules for identifiers.  
  
LOCAL  
Specifies that the scope of the cursor is local to the batch, stored procedure, or trigger in which the cursor was created. The cursor name is only valid within this scope. The cursor can be referenced by local cursor variables in the batch, stored procedure, or trigger, or a stored procedure `OUTPUT` parameter. An `OUTPUT` parameter is used to pass the local cursor back to the calling batch, stored procedure, or trigger, which can assign the parameter to a cursor variable to reference the cursor after the stored procedure terminates. The cursor is implicitly deallocated when the batch, stored procedure, or trigger terminates, unless the cursor was passed back in an `OUTPUT` parameter. If it is passed back in an `OUTPUT` parameter, the cursor is deallocated when the last variable referencing it is deallocated or goes out of scope.  
  
GLOBAL  
Specifies that the scope of the cursor is global to the connection. The cursor name can be referenced in any stored procedure or batch executed by the connection. The cursor is only implicitly deallocated at disconnect.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If neither `GLOBAL` or `LOCAL` is specified, the default is controlled by the setting of the **default to local cursor** database option.  
  
FORWARD_ONLY  
Specifies that the cursor can only move forward and be scrolled from the first to the last row. `FETCH NEXT` is the only supported fetch option. All insert, update, and delete statements made by the current user (or committed by other users) that affect rows in the result set are visible as the rows are fetched. Because the cursor cannot be scrolled backward, however, changes made to rows in the database after the row was fetched are not visible through the cursor. Forward-only cursors are dynamic by default, meaning that all changes are detected as the current row is processed. This provides faster cursor opening and enables the result set to display updates made to the underlying tables. While forward-only cursors do not support backward scrolling, applications can return to the beginning of the result set by closing and reopening the cursor. 
If `FORWARD_ONLY` is specified without the `STATIC`, `KEYSET`, or `DYNAMIC` keywords, the cursor operates as a dynamic cursor. When neither `FORWARD_ONLY` nor `SCROLL` is specified, `FORWARD_ONLY` is the default, unless the keywords `STATIC`, `KEYSET`, or `DYNAMIC` are specified. `STATIC`, `KEYSET`, and `DYNAMIC` cursors default to `SCROLL`. Unlike database APIs such as ODBC and ADO, `FORWARD_ONLY` is supported with `STATIC`, `KEYSET`, and `DYNAMIC` [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] cursors.  
   
 STATIC  
Specifies that the cursor always displays the result set as it was when the cursor was first opened, and makes a temporary copy of the data to be used by the cursor. All requests to the cursor are answered from this temporary table in **tempdb**. Therefore inserts, updates, and deletes made to base tables are not reflected in the data returned by fetches made to this cursor, and this cursor does not detect changes made to the membership, order, or values of the result set after the cursor is opened. Static cursors may detect their own updates, deletes, and inserts, although they are not required to do so. 
For example, suppose a static cursor fetches a row, and another application then updates that row. If the application refetches the row from the static cursor, the values it sees are unchanged, despite the changes made by the other application. All types of scrolling are supported. 
  
KEYSET  
Specifies that the membership and order of rows in the cursor are fixed when the cursor is opened. The set of keys that uniquely identify the rows is built into a table in **tempdb** known as the **keyset**. This cursor provides functionality between a static and a dynamic cursor in its ability to detect changes. Like a static cursor, it does not always detect changes to the membership and order of the result set. Like a dynamic cursor, it does detect changes to the values of rows in the result set. 
Keyset-driven cursors are controlled by a set of unique identifiers (keys) known as the keyset. The keys are built from a set of columns that uniquely identify the rows in the result set. The keyset is the set of key values from all the rows returned by the query statement. With keyset-driven cursors, a key is built and saved for each row in the cursor and stored either on the client workstation or on the server. When you access each row, the stored key is used to fetch the current data values from the data source. In a keyset-driven cursor, result set membership is frozen when the keyset is fully populated. Thereafter, additions or updates that affect membership are not a part of the result set until it is reopened. 
Changes to data values (made either by the keyset owner or other processes) are visible as the user scrolls through the result set:
-  If a row is deleted, an attempt to fetch the row returns an `@@FETCH_STATUS` of -2 because the deleted row appears as a gap in the result set. The key for the row exists in the keyset, but the row no longer exists in the result set. 
-  Inserts made outside the cursor (by other processes) are visible only if the cursor is closed and reopened. Inserts made from inside the cursor are visible at the end of the result set.
-  Updates of key values from outside the cursor resemble a delete of the old row followed by an insert of the new row. The row with the new values is not visible, and attempts to fetch the row with the old values return an `@@FETCH_STATUS` of -2. The new values are visible if the update is done through the cursor by specifying the `WHERE CURRENT OF` clause. 

> [!NOTE]  
> If the query references at least one table without a unique index, the keyset cursor is converted to a static cursor.  
  
DYNAMIC  
Defines a cursor that reflects all data changes made to the rows in its result set as you scroll around the cursor and fetch a new record, regardless of whether the changes occur from inside the cursor or by other users outside the cursor. Therefore all insert, update, and delete statements made by all users are visible through the cursor. The data values, order, and membership of the rows can change on each fetch. The `ABSOLUTE` fetch option is not supported with dynamic cursors. Updates made outside the cursor are not visible until they are committed (unless the cursor transaction isolation level is set to `UNCOMMITTED`). 
For example, suppose a dynamic cursor fetches two rows and another application then updates one of those rows and deletes the other. If the dynamic cursor then fetches those rows, it will not find the deleted row, but it will display the new values for the updated row. 
  
FAST_FORWARD  
Specifies a `FORWARD_ONLY`, `READ_ONLY` cursor with performance optimizations enabled. `FAST_FORWARD` cannot be specified if `SCROLL` or `FOR_UPDATE` is also specified. This type of cursor does not allow data modifications from inside the cursor.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Both `FAST_FORWARD` and `FORWARD_ONLY` can be used in the same `DECLARE CURSOR` statement.  
  
READ_ONLY  
Prevents updates made through this cursor. The cursor cannot be referenced in a `WHERE CURRENT OF` clause in an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement. This option overrides the default capability of a cursor to be updated.  
  
SCROLL_LOCKS  
Specifies that positioned updates or deletes made through the cursor are guaranteed to succeed. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] locks the rows as they are read into the cursor to ensure their availability for later modifications. `SCROLL_LOCKS` cannot be specified if `FAST_FORWARD` or `STATIC` is also specified.  
  
OPTIMISTIC  
Specifies that positioned updates or deletes made through the cursor do not succeed if the row has been updated since it was read into the cursor. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not lock rows as they are read into the cursor. It instead uses comparisons of **timestamp** column values, or a checksum value if the table has no **timestamp** column, to determine whether the row was modified after it was read into the cursor. If the row was modified, the attempted positioned update or delete fails. `OPTIMISTIC` cannot be specified if `FAST_FORWARD` is also specified.  
  
 TYPE_WARNING  
 Specifies that a warning message is sent to the client when the cursor is implicitly converted from the requested type to another.  
  
 *select_statement*  
 Is a standard SELECT statement that defines the result set of the cursor. The keywords `COMPUTE`, `COMPUTE BY`, `FOR BROWSE`, and `INTO` are not allowed within *select_statement* of a cursor declaration.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You can use a query hint within a cursor declaration; however, if you also use the `FOR UPDATE OF` clause, specify `OPTION (<query_hint>)` after `FOR UPDATE OF`.  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] implicitly converts the cursor to another type if clauses in *select_statement* conflict with the functionality of the requested cursor type. For more information, see Implicit Cursor Conversions.  
  
FOR UPDATE [OF *column_name* [**,**...*n*]]  
Defines updatable columns within the cursor. If `OF <column_name> [, <... n>]` is supplied, only the columns listed allow modifications. If `UPDATE` is specified without a column list, all columns can be updated, unless the `READ_ONLY` concurrency option was specified.  
  
## Remarks  
`DECLARE CURSOR` defines the attributes of a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] server cursor, such as its scrolling behavior and the query used to build the result set on which the cursor operates. The `OPEN` statement populates the result set, and `FETCH` returns a row from the result set. The `CLOSE` statement releases the current result set associated with the cursor. The `DEALLOCATE` statement releases the resources used by the cursor.  
  
The first form of the `DECLARE CURSOR` statement uses the ISO syntax for declaring cursor behaviors. The second form of `DECLARE CURSOR` uses [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] extensions that allow you to define cursors using the same cursor types used in the database API cursor functions of ODBC or ADO.  
  
You cannot mix the two forms. If you specify the `SCROLL` or `INSENSITIVE` keywords before the `CURSOR` keyword, you cannot use any keywords between the `CURSOR` and `FOR <select_statement>` keywords. If you specify any keywords between the `CURSOR` and `FOR <select_statement>` keywords, you cannot specify `SCROLL` or `INSENSITIVE` before the `CURSOR` keyword.  
  
If a `DECLARE CURSOR` using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] syntax does not specify `READ_ONLY`, `OPTIMISTIC`, or `SCROLL_LOCKS`, the default is as follows:  
  
-   If the `SELECT` statement does not support updates (insufficient permissions, accessing remote tables that do not support updates, and so on), the cursor is `READ_ONLY`.  
  
-   `STATIC` and `FAST_FORWARD` cursors default to `READ_ONLY`.  
  
-   `DYNAMIC` and `KEYSET` cursors default to `OPTIMISTIC`.  
  
Cursor names can be referenced only by other [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements. They cannot be referenced by database API functions. For example, after declaring a cursor, the cursor name cannot be referenced from OLE DB, ODBC or ADO functions or methods. The cursor rows cannot be fetched using the fetch functions or methods of the APIs; the rows can be fetched only by [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] FETCH statements.  
  
After a cursor has been declared, these system stored procedures can be used to determine the characteristics of the cursor.  
  
|System stored procedures|Description|  
|------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**sp_cursor_list**|Returns a list of cursors currently visible on the connection and their attributes.|  
|**sp_describe_cursor**|Describes the attributes of a cursor, such as whether it is a forward-only or scrolling cursor.|  
|**sp_describe_cursor_columns**|Describes the attributes of the columns in the cursor result set.|  
|**sp_describe_cursor_tables**|Describes the base tables accessed by the cursor.|  
  
 Variables may be used as part of the *select_statement* that declares a cursor. Cursor variable values do not change after a cursor is declared.  
  
## Permissions  
 Permissions of `DECLARE CURSOR` default to any user that has `SELECT` permissions on the views, tables, and columns used in the cursor.
 
## Limitations and Restrictions

You cannot use cursors or triggers on a table with a clustered columnstore index. This restriction does not apply to nonclustered columnstore indexes; you can use cursors and triggers on a table with a nonclustered columnstore index. 
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using simple cursor and syntax  

The result set generated at the opening of this cursor includes all rows and all columns in the table. This cursor can be updated, and all updates and deletes are represented in fetches made against this cursor. `FETCH NEXT` is the only fetch available because the `SCROLL` option has not been specified.  
 
```sql  
DECLARE vend_cursor CURSOR  
    FOR SELECT * FROM Purchasing.Vendor  
OPEN vend_cursor  
FETCH NEXT FROM vend_cursor;  
```  
  
### B. Using nested cursors to produce report output  
 The following example shows how cursors can be nested to produce complex reports. The inner cursor is declared for each vendor.  
  
```sql  
SET NOCOUNT ON;  
  
DECLARE @vendor_id INT, @vendor_name NVARCHAR(50),  
    @message VARCHAR(80), @product NVARCHAR(50);  
  
PRINT '-------- Vendor Products Report --------';  
  
DECLARE vendor_cursor CURSOR FOR   
SELECT VendorID, Name  
FROM Purchasing.Vendor  
WHERE PreferredVendorStatus = 1  
ORDER BY VendorID;  
  
OPEN vendor_cursor  
  
FETCH NEXT FROM vendor_cursor   
INTO @vendor_id, @vendor_name  
  
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0  
BEGIN  
    PRINT ' '  
    SELECT @message = '----- Products From Vendor: ' +   
        @vendor_name  
  
    PRINT @message  
  
    -- Declare an inner cursor based     
    -- on vendor_id from the outer cursor.  
  
    DECLARE product_cursor CURSOR FOR   
    SELECT v.Name  
    FROM Purchasing.ProductVendor pv, Production.Product v  
    WHERE pv.ProductID = v.ProductID AND  
    pv.VendorID = @vendor_id  -- Variable value from the outer cursor  
  
    OPEN product_cursor  
    FETCH NEXT FROM product_cursor INTO @product  
  
    IF @@FETCH_STATUS <> 0   
        PRINT '         <<None>>'       
  
    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0  
    BEGIN  
  
        SELECT @message = '         ' + @product  
        PRINT @message  
        FETCH NEXT FROM product_cursor INTO @product  
        END  
  
    CLOSE product_cursor  
    DEALLOCATE product_cursor  
        -- Get the next vendor.  
    FETCH NEXT FROM vendor_cursor   
    INTO @vendor_id, @vendor_name  
END   
CLOSE vendor_cursor;  
DEALLOCATE vendor_cursor;  
```
