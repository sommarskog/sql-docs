# M (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  The **M** (measure) value of the **geography** instance. The semantics of the measure value are user-defined but generally describe the distance along a linestring. For example, the measure value could be used to keep track of mileposts along a road.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.M  
```  

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return Types
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] type: **float**  
  
 CLR type: **SqlDouble**  
  
## Remarks  
 The value of this property is null if the **geography** instance is not a **Point**, as well as for any **Point** instance for which it is not set.  
  
 This property is read-only.  
  
 M values are not used in any calculations made by the library and will not be carried through any library calculations.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates a `Point` instance with Z (elevation) and M (measure) values and uses `M` to fetch the `M` value of the instance.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('POINT(-122.34900 47.65100 10.3 12)', 4326);  
SELECT @g.M;  
```
