# NumRings (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Returns the total number of rings in a **Polygon** instance. In the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] **geography** type, external and internal rings are not distinguished, as any ring can be taken to be the external ring.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.NumRings ()  
```  

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return Type  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **int**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlInt32**  
  
## Remarks  
 This method will return NULL if this is not a **Polygon** instance and will return 0 if the instance is empty. This method is precise.  
  
## Examples  
 This example creates a `Polygon` instance with two rings and confirms that it has two rings.  
  
```sql
DECLARE @g geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((-122.358 47.653, -122.348 47.649, -122.348 47.658, -122.358 47.658, -122.358 47.653), (-122.357 47.654, -122.357 47.657, -122.349 47.657, -122.349 47.650, -122.357 47.654))', 4326);  
SELECT @g.NumRings();  
```
