# Long (geography Data Type)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  The longitude property of the **geography** instance.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
.Long  
```  

[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return Value  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] type: **float**  
  
 CLR type: **SqlDouble**  
  
## Remarks  
 In the OpenGIS model, Long is defined only on **geography** instances composed of a single point. This property will return NULL if **geography** instances contain more than a single point. This property is precise and read-only.  
  
## Examples  
 This example creates a **Point** instance and retrieves the longitude of the point.  
  
```sql
DECLARE @g geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('POINT(-122.34900 47.65100)', 4326);  
SELECT @g.Long;  
```
