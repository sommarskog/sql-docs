# STEquals (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Returns 1 if a **geography** instance represents the same point set as another **geography** instance. Returns 0 if it does not.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.STEquals ( other_geography )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *other_geography*  
 Is another **geography** instance to compare against the instance on which `STEquals()` is invoked.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **bit**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlBoolean**  
  
## Remarks  
 This method always returns null if the spatial reference IDs (SRIDs) of the **geography** instances do not match.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates two `geography` instances with `STGeomFromText()` that are equal but not trivially equal, and uses `STEquals()` to test their equality. The instances are equal because `LINESTRING` and `POINT` are contained within the `POLYGON`.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geography;  
DECLARE @h geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POLYGON((-122.368 47.658, -122.338 47.649, -122.338 47.658, -122.368 47.658, -122.368 47.658)), LINESTRING(-122.360 47.656, -122.343 47.656), POINT (-122.35 47.656))', 4326);  
SET @h = geography::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((-122.368 47.658, -122.338 47.649, -122.338 47.658, -122.368 47.658, -122.368 47.658))', 4326);  
SELECT @g.STEquals(@h);  
```
