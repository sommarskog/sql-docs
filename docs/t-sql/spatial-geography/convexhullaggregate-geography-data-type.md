# ConvexHullAggregate (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Returns a convex hull for a given set of **geography** objects.
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
ConvexHullAggregate ( geography_operand )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *geography_operand*  
 Is a **geography** type table column that represents a set of **geography** objects.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **geography**  
  
## Exception  
 Throws a `FormatException` when there are input values that are not valid. See [STIsValid &#40;geography Data Type&#41;](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stisvalid-geography-data-type.md)  
  
## Remarks  
 Method returns **null** when the input is empty or the input has different SRIDs. See [Spatial Reference Identifiers &#40;SRIDs&#41;](../../relational-databases/spatial/spatial-reference-identifiers-srids.md)  
  
 Method ignores **null** inputs.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Method returns **null** if all inputted values are **null**.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example returns a convex hull of the set of **geography** objects.  
  
 ```sql
 USE AdventureWorks2022  
 GO  
 SELECT geography::ConvexHullAggregate(SpatialLocation).ToString() AS SpatialLocation  
 FROM Person.Address  
 WHERE City LIKE ('Bothell')
 ```
