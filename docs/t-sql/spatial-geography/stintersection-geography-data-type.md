# STIntersection (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Returns an object that represents the points where a **geography** instance intersects another **geography** instance.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.STIntersection ( other_geography )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *other_geography*  
 Is another **geography** instance to compare with the instance on which STIntersection() is being invoked.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **geography**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlGeography**  
  
## Remarks  
 The intersection of two geography instances is returned.  
  
 STIntersection() always returns null if the spatial reference identifiers (SRIDs) of the **geography** instances do not match.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports spatial instances that are larger than a hemisphere. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] may include **FullGlobe** instances in the set of possible results returned on the server.  
  
 The result may contain circular arc segments only if the input instances contain circular arc segments.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Computing the intersection of a Polygon and a LineString  
 The following example uses `STIntersection()` to compute the intersection of a `Polygon` and a `LineString`.  
  
```sql
DECLARE @g geography;  
DECLARE @h geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((-122.358 47.653, -122.348 47.649, -122.348 47.658, -122.358 47.658, -122.358 47.653))', 4326);  
SET @h = geography::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(-122.360 47.656, -122.343 47.656)', 4326);  
SELECT @g.STIntersection(@h).ToString();  
```  
  
### B. Computing the intersection of a Polygon and a CurvePolygon  
 The following example returns an instance that contains a circular arc segment.  
  
```sql
DECLARE @g geography;  
DECLARE @h geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((-122.358 47.653, -122.348 47.649, -122.348 47.658, -122.358 47.658, -122.358 47.653))', 4326);  
SET @h = geography::STGeomFromText('CURVEPOLYGON(CIRCULARSTRING(-122.351 47.656, -122.341 47.656, -122.341 47.661, -122.351 47.661, -122.351 47.656))', 4326);  
SELECT @g.STIntersection(@h).ToString();  
```  
  
### C. Computing the symmetric difference with FullGlobe  
 The following example compares the symmetric difference of a `Polygon` with `FullGlobe`.  
  
```sql
DECLARE @g geography = 'POLYGON((-122.358 47.653, -122.348 47.649, -122.348 47.658, -122.358 47.658, -122.358 47.653))';  
SELECT @g.STIntersection('FULLGLOBE').ToString();  
```
