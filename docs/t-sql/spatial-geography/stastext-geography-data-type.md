# STAsText (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Returns the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Well-Known Text (WKT) representation of a **geography** instance. This text will not contain any Z (elevation) or M (measure) values carried by the instance.  
  
 This **geography** data type method supports **FullGlobe** instances or spatial instances that are larger than a hemisphere.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.STAsText ( )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Return Types
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **nvarchar(max)**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlChars**  
  
## Remarks  
 The OGC type of a **geography** instance can be determined by invoking [STGeometryType()](../../t-sql/spatial-geography/stgeometrytype-geography-data-type.md).  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], the set of possible results returned on the server has been extended to **FullGlobe** instances.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses `STAsText()` to create a `LineString``geography` instance from (-122.360, 47.656) to (-122.343, 47.656) from text. It then returns the result in text.  
  
```sql
DECLARE @g geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(-122.360 47.656, -122.343 47.656)', 4326);  
SELECT @g.STAsText();  
```
