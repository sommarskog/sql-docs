# STPointN (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Returns the specified point in a **geography** instance.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.STPointN ( expression )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *expression*  
 Is an **int** expression between 1 and the number of points in the **geography** instance.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **geography**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlGeography**  
  
 Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) type: **Point**  
  
## Remarks  
 If a **geography** instance is user-created, STPointN() returns the point specified by *expression* by ordering the points in the order in which they were originally input.  
  
 If a **geography** instance is constructed by the system, STPointN() returns the point specified by *expression* by ordering all the points in the same order they would be output: first by **geography** instance, then by ring within the instance (if appropriate), and then by point within the ring. This order is deterministic.  
  
 If this method is called with a value less than 1, it throws an **ArgumentOutOfRangeException**.  
  
 If this method is called with a value greater than the number of points in the instance, it returns null.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates a `LineString` instance and uses `STPointN()` to retrieve the second point in the description of the instance.  
  
```sql
DECLARE @g geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(-122.360 47.656, -122.343 47.656)', 4326);  
SELECT @g.STPointN(2).ToString();  
```
