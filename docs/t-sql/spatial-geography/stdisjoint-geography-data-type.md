# STDisjoint (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Returns 1 if a **geography** instance is spatially disjoint from another **geography** instance. Returns 0 if it is not.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.STDisjoint ( other_geography )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *other_geography*  
 Is another **geography** instance to compare against the instance on which STDisjoint() is invoked.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **bit**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlBoolean**  
  
## Remarks  
 Two **geography** instances are disjoint if the intersection of their point sets is empty.  
  
 This method always returns null if the spatial reference IDs (SRIDs) of the **geography** instances do not match.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses `STDisjoint()` to test two `geography` instances to see if they are spatially disjoint.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geography;  
DECLARE @h geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(-122.360 47.656, -122.343 47.656)', 4326);  
SET @h = geography::STGeomFromText('POINT(-122.34900 47.65100)', 4326);  
SELECT @g.STDisjoint(@h);  
```
