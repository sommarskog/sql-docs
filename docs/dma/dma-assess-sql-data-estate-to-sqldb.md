# Assess the readiness of a SQL Server data estate migrating to Azure SQL Database using the Data Migration Assistant

Migrating hundreds of SQL Server instances and thousands of databases to Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance, our Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings, is a considerable task. To streamline the process as much as possible, you need to feel confident about your relative readiness for migration. Identifying low-hanging fruit, including the servers and databases that are fully ready or that require minimal effort to prepare for migration, eases and accelerates your efforts.

This article provides step-by-step instructions for leveraging the [Data Migration Assistant](./dma-overview.md) to summarize readiness results and surface them on the [Azure Migrate](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customPortal=false#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Migrate/AmhResourceMenuBlade/overview) hub.

## Create a project and add a tool

Set up a new Azure Migrate project in an Azure subscription, and then add a tool.

An Azure Migrate project is used to store discovery, assessment, and migration metadata collected from the environment you're assessing or migrating. You also use a project to track discovered assets and to orchestrate assessment and migration.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, select **All services**, and then search for Azure Migrate.
2. Under **Services**, select **Azure Migrate**.

   ![Azure Migrate - select service](../dma/media//dma-assess-sql-data-estate-to-sqldb/dms-azure-migrate-services.png)

3. On the **Overview** page, select **Assess and migrate databases**.

   ![Azure Migrate - initiate assessment](../dma/media//dma-assess-sql-data-estate-to-sqldb/dms-azure-migrate-hub-assess.png)

4. In **Databases**, under **Getting started**, select **Add tool(s)**.

   ![Azure Migrate - add tools](../dma/media//dma-assess-sql-data-estate-to-sqldb/dms-azure-migrate-add-tools.png)

5. On the **Migrate project** tab, select your Azure subscription and resource group (if you don't already have a resource group, create one).
6. Under **Project Details**, specify the project name and the geography in which you want to create the project.

    ![Azure Migrate - add a tool dialog box](../dma/media//dma-assess-sql-data-estate-to-sqldb/dms-azure-migrate-add-tool-dialog.png)

    You can create an Azure Migrate project in any of these geographies.

    | **Geography**  | **Storage location region** |
    | ------------- | ------------- |
    | Asia | Southeast Asia or East Asia |
    | Europe | South Europe or West Europe |
    | United Kingdom | UK South or UK West |
    | United States | Central US or West US 2 |

    The geography specified for the project is only used to store the metadata gathered from on-premises VMs. You can select any target region for the actual migration.

7. Select **Next**, and then add an assessment tool.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you create a project, you must add at least one assessment or migration tool.

8. On the **Select assessment tool** tab, **Azure Migrate: Database Assessment** appears as the assessment tool to add. If you don't currently need an assessment tool, select the **Skip adding an assessment tool for now** check box. Select **Next**.

    ![Azure Migrate - Select assessment tool tab](../dma/media//dma-assess-sql-data-estate-to-sqldb/dms-azure-migrate-select-assessment-tool.png)

9. On the **Select migration tool** tab, **Azure Migrate: Database Migration** appears as the migration tool to add. If you don't currently need a migration tool, select the **Skip adding a migration tool for now**. Select **Next**.

    ![Azure Migrate - Select migration tool tab](../dma/media//dma-assess-sql-data-estate-to-sqldb/dms-azure-migrate-select-migration-tool.png)

10. In **Review + add tools**, review the settings, and the select **Add tools**.

    ![Azure Migrate - Review + add tool(s) tab](../dma/media//dma-assess-sql-data-estate-to-sqldb/dms-azure-migrate-review-tools.png)

    After creating the project, you can select additional tools for assessment and migration of servers and workloads, databases, and web apps.

## Assess and upload assessment results

After you successfully create a migration project, under **Assessment tools**, in the **Azure Migrate: Database Assessment** box, instructions for downloading and using the Data Migration Assistant tool display.

   ![Azure Migrate - Assessment tool added](../dma/media//dma-assess-sql-data-estate-to-sqldb/dms-azure-migrate-assessment-tool-added.png)

1. Download Data Migration Assistant using the link provided, and then install it on a computer with access to your source SQL Server instances.
2. Start Data Migration Assistant.

### Create an assessment

1. On the left, select the **+** icon, and then select the assessment **Project type**
2. Specify the project name, and then select the source server and target server types.

    If you're upgrading your on-premises SQL Server instance to a later version of SQL Server or to SQL Server hosted on an Azure VM, set the source and target server type to **SQL Server**. Set the target server type to **Azure SQL Managed Instance** for an Azure SQL Database (PaaS) target readiness assessment.

3. Select **Create**.
