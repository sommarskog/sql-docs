# Create a Java jar file from class files
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2019 and later](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

Learn how to package your class files into a jar file, when using [SQL Server Language Extensions](../language-extensions-overview.md) to execute Java code. We recommend you package your files.

## Create a jar file

To create a jar from class files, navigate to the folder containing your class file and run this command:

```cmd
jar -cf <MyJar.jar> *.class
```

Make sure the path to `jar.exe` is part of the system path variable. Alternatively, specify the full path to jar which can be found under `/bin` in the JDK folder. For example:

```cmd
C:\Users\MyUser\Desktop\jdk1.8.0_201\bin\jar -cf <MyJar.jar> *.class
```
