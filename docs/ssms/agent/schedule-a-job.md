# Schedule a Job
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to schedule a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent job.  
  
-   **Before you begin:** ,  
  
    [Security](#Security)  
  
-   **To schedule a job, using:**  
  
    [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMS)  
  
    [Transact-SQL](#TSQL)  
  
    [SQL Server Management Objects](#SMO)

#### To create and attach a schedule to a job  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, expand **Jobs**, right-click the job you want to schedule, and click **Properties**.  
  
3.  Select the **Schedules** page, and then click **New**.  
  
4.  In the **Name** box, type a name for the new schedule.  
  
5.  Clear the **Enabled** check box if you do not want the schedule to take effect immediately following its creation.  
  
6.  For **Schedule Type**, select one of the following:  
  
    -   Click **Start automatically when SQL Server Agent starts** to start the job when the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service is started.  
  
    -   Click **Start whenever the CPUs become idle** to start the job when the CPUs reach an idle condition.  
  
    -   Click **Recurring** if you want a schedule to run repeatedly. To set the recurring schedule, complete the **Frequency**, **Daily Frequency**, and **Duration** groups on the dialog.  
  
    -   Click **One time** if you want the schedule to run only once. To set the **One time** schedule, complete the **One-time occurrence** group on the dialog.  
  
#### To attach a schedule to a job  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, expand **Jobs**, right-click the job that you want to schedule, and click **Properties**.  
  
3.  Select the **Schedules** page, and then click **Pick**.  
  
4.  Select the schedule that you want to attach, and then click **OK**.  
  
5.  In the **Job Properties** dialog box, double-click the attached schedule.  
  
6.  Verify that **Start date** is set correctly. If it is not, set the date when you want for the schedule to start, and then click **OK**.  
  
7.  In the **Job Properties** dialog box, click **OK**.  
  
## <a name="TSQL"></a>Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To schedule a job  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
    -- creates a schedule named NightlyJobs.   
    -- Jobs that use this schedule execute every day when the time on the server is 01:00.   
    EXEC sp_add_schedule  
        @schedule_name = N'NightlyJobs' ,  
        @freq_type = 4,  
        @freq_interval = 1,  
        @active_start_time = 010000 ;  
    GO  
    -- attaches the schedule to the job BackupDatabase  
    EXEC sp_attach_schedule  
       @job_name = N'BackupDatabase',  
       @schedule_name = N'NightlyJobs' ;  
    GO  
    ```

## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
Use the **JobSchedule** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. For more information, see[SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/sql-server-management-objects-smo-programming-guide.md).
