# Start, Stop, or Pause the SQL Server Agent Service

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to start, stop, or restart the SQL Server Agent Service in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using SQL Server Management Studio.  
  
You can configure the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service to start automatically when the operating system starts, or you can start it manually when you need to complete jobs. You can stop or pause the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service to suspend jobs, operator notifications, and alerts.

-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent must be running as a service in order to automate administrative tasks. For more information, see [Configure SQL Server Agent](../../ssms/agent/configure-sql-server-agent.md).  
  
-   Object Explorer only displays the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent node if you have permission to use it.  
  
### <a name="Security"></a>Security  
  
#### <a name="Permissions"></a>Permissions  
To perform its functions, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent must be configured to use the credentials of an account that is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The account must have the following Windows permissions:  
  
-   Log on as a service (SeServiceLogonRight)  
  
-   Replace a process-level token (SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege)  
  
-   Bypass traverse checking (SeChangeNotifyPrivilege)  
  
-   Adjust memory quotas for a process (SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege)  
  
For more information about the Windows permissions required for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service account, see [Select an Account for the SQL Server Agent Service](../../ssms/agent/select-an-account-for-the-sql-server-agent-service.md) and [Setting Up Windows Service Accounts](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-windows-service-accounts-and-permissions.md).
