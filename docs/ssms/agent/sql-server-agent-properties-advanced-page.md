# SQL Server Agent Properties (Advanced Page)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

Use this page to view and modify advanced properties of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service.  
  
## Options  
**SQL Server event forwarding**  
The options in this category activate and configure event forwarding.  
  
**Forward events to a different server**  
Forwards [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent events to a different server.  
  
**Server**  
Select the name of the server to forward events to.  
  
**Unhandled events**  
Forwards only unhandled events to the specified server. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent forwards only events that no alert responds to.  
  
**All events**  
Forwards all events. When an alert in the local instance responds to the event, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] agent will both forward the event and process the alert.  
  
**If event has severity at or above**  
Forwards only events with a severity level at or above the level specified.  
  
**Idle CPU Condition**  
The options in this category define the conditions under which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent runs jobs scheduled to run on the Idle CPU schedule.  
  
**Define idle CPU condition**  
Defines the conditions under which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent considers the CPU to be idle.  
  
**Average CPU usage falls below**  
Percentage of CPU usage below which the CPU is considered to be idle.  
  
**And remains below this level for**  
Amount of time that the average CPU must below the level specified before [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent runs jobs on the Idle CPU schedule.
