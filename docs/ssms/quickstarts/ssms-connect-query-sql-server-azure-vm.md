# Quickstart: Connect and query a SQL Server instance on an Azure virtual machine using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Get started using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to connect to your SQL Server instance on an Azure Virtual Machine and run some Transact-SQL (T-SQL) commands.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Connect to a SQL Server instance
> - Create a database
> - Create a table in your new database
> - Insert rows into your new table
> - Query the new table and view the results
> - Use the query window table to verify your connection properties
## Prerequisites

To complete this article, you need SQL Server Management Studio and access to a data source.

- Install [SQL Server Management Studio](../download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).
- [SQL Server on an Azure VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/?&ef_id=CjwKCAiA17P9BRB2EiwAMvwNyP3g3mY45X8dbqEtIr8HASwSLUYRBrwwciZptYt0vUU4K7TuWnXTbxoCoPQQAvD_BwE:G:s&OCID=AID2100131_SEM_CjwKCAiA17P9BRB2EiwAMvwNyP3g3mY45X8dbqEtIr8HASwSLUYRBrwwciZptYt0vUU4K7TuWnXTbxoCoPQQAvD_BwE:G:s&gclid=CjwKCAiA17P9BRB2EiwAMvwNyP3g3mY45X8dbqEtIr8HASwSLUYRBrwwciZptYt0vUU4K7TuWnXTbxoCoPQQAvD_BwE).

## Connect to SQL Virtual Machines

The following steps show how to create an optional DNS label for your Azure VM and then connect with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

### Configure a DNS Label for the public IP address

To connect to the SQL Server Database Engine from the Internet, consider creating a DNS Label for your public IP address. You can join by IP address, but the DNS Label creates an A Record that is easier to identify and abstracts the underlying public IP address.

> [!NOTE]
> DNS Labels are not required if you plan to only connect to the SQL Server instance within the same Virtual Network or only locally.

1. Create a DNS Label by selecting **Virtual machines** in the portal. Select your SQL Server VM to bring up its properties.

2. In the virtual machine overview, select your **Public IP address**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-sql-server-azure-vm/azure-sql-vm-ip-address-.png" alt-text="public ip address":::

3. In the properties for your Public IP address, expand **Configuration**.

4. Enter a DNS Label name. This name is an A Record that can be used to directly connect to your SQL Server VM by name instead of by IP Address.

5. Select the **Save** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-sql-server-azure-vm/azure-sql-vm-dns-label.png" alt-text="dns label":::

### Connect

1. Start SQL Server Management Studio. The first time you run SSMS, the **Connect to Server** window opens. If it doesn't open, you can open it manually by selecting **Object Explorer** > **Connect** > **Database Engine**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-sql-server-azure-vm/connect-object-explorer.png" alt-text="Connect link in Object Explorer":::

2. The **Connect to Server** dialog box appears. Enter the following information:

    |   Setting   |   Suggested Value(s)   |   Description   |
    |--------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
    | **Server type** | Database engine | For **Server type**, select **Database Engine** (usually the default option). |
    | **Server name** | The fully qualified server name | For **Server name**, enter the name of your Azure SQL VM name. You can also use the Azure SQL VM IP address to connect. | 
    | **Authentication** | SQL Server Authentication | Use **SQL Server Authentication** for Azure SQL VM to connect. Also, if you have an Azure Active Directory environment setup, you can use any of the Azure Active Directory options. </br> </br> The **Windows Authentication** method isn't supported for Azure SQL VM. For more information, see [Azure SQL authentication](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-security-overview#access-management).|
    | **Login** | Server account user ID | The user ID from the server account used to create the server. A login is required when using **SQL Server Authentication**. |
    | **Password** | Server account password | The password from the server account used to create the server. A password is required when using **SQL Server Authentication**. |

    :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-sql-server-azure-vm/connect-to-azure-sql-vm-object-explorer.png" alt-text="Server name field for SQL virtual Machines":::

3. After you've completed all the fields, select **Connect**.

    You can also modify additional connection options by selecting **Options**. Examples of connection options are the database you're connecting to, the connection timeout value, and the network protocol. This article uses the default values for all the options.

4. To verify that your SQL Server on Azure VM succeeded, expand and explore the objects within **Object Explorer** where the server name, the SQL Server version, and the username are displayed. These objects are different depending on the server type.

## Troubleshoot connectivity issues

Although the portal provides options to configure connectivity automatically, it's useful to know how to manually configure connectivity. Understanding the requirements can also aid troubleshooting.

The following table lists the requirements to connect to SQL Server on Azure VM.

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| [Enable SQL Server authentication mode](../../database-engine/configure-windows/change-server-authentication-mode.md#use-ssms) | SQL Server authentication is needed to connect to the VM remotely unless you have configured Active Directory on a virtual network. |
| [Create a SQL login](../../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/create-a-login.md) | If you're using SQL authentication, you need a SQL login with a user name and password that also has permissions to your target database. |
| Enable TCP/IP protocol | SQL Server must allow connections over TCP. |
| [Enable firewall rule for the SQL Server port](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-windows-firewall-for-database-engine-access.md) | The firewall on the VM must allow inbound traffic on the SQL Server port (default 1433). |
| [Create a network security group rule for TCP 1433](/azure/virtual-network/manage-network-security-group#create-a-security-rule) | Allow the VM to receive traffic on the SQL Server port (default 1433) if you want to connect over the internet. This isn't required for local and virtual-network-only connections. This step is only required in the Azure portal. |

> [!TIP]
> The steps in the preceding table are done for you when you configure connectivity in the portal. Use these steps only to confirm your configuration or to set up connectivity manually for SQL Server.

## Create a database

Create a database named TutorialDB by following the below steps:

1. Right-click your server instance in Object Explorer, and then select **New Query**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-sql-server-azure-vm/new-query.png" alt-text="The New Query link":::

2. Paste the following T-SQL code snippet into the query window:

    ```sql
    IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT name
    FROM sys.databases
    WHERE name = N'TutorialDB'
    )
    CREATE DATABASE [TutorialDB]
    GO
    
    ALTER DATABASE [TutorialDB] SET QUERY_STORE=ON
    GO
    ```

3. Execute the query by selecting **Execute** or selecting F5 on your keyboard.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-sql-server-azure-vm/execute.png" alt-text="The Execute command":::
  
    After the query is complete, the new TutorialDB database appears in the list of databases in Object Explorer. If it isn't displayed, right-click the **Databases** node, and then select **Refresh**.

## Create a table in the new database

In this section, you create a table in the newly created TutorialDB database. Because the query editor is still in the context of the *master* database, switch the connection context to the *TutorialDB* database by doing the following steps:

1. In the database drop-down list, select the database that you want, as shown here:

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-sql-server-azure-vm/change-db.png" alt-text="Change database":::

2. Paste the following T-SQL code snippet into the query window:

    ```sql
    USE [TutorialDB]
    -- Create a new table called 'Customers' in schema 'dbo'
    -- Drop the table if it already exists
    IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.Customers', 'U') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE dbo.Customers
    GO
    -- Create the table in the specified schema
    CREATE TABLE dbo.Customers
    (
       CustomerId        INT    NOT NULL   PRIMARY KEY, -- primary key column
       Name      [NVARCHAR](50)  NOT NULL,
       Location  [NVARCHAR](50)  NOT NULL,
       Email     [NVARCHAR](50)  NOT NULL
    );
    GO
    ```

3. Execute the query by selecting **Execute** or selecting F5 on your keyboard.

After the query is complete, the new Customers table is displayed in the list of tables in Object Explorer. If the table isn't displayed, right-click the **TutorialDB** > **Tables** node in Object Explorer, and then select **Refresh**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-sql-server-azure-vm/new-table.png" alt-text="New table":::

## Insert rows into the new table

Now let's insert some rows into the Customers table that you created. Paste the following T-SQL code snippet into the query window, and then select **Execute**:

   ```sql
   -- Insert rows into table 'Customers'
   INSERT INTO dbo.Customers
      ([CustomerId],[Name],[Location],[Email])
   VALUES
      ( 1, N'Orlando', N'Australia', N''),
      ( 2, N'Keith', N'India', N'keith0@adventure-works.com'),
      ( 3, N'Donna', N'Germany', N'donna0@adventure-works.com'),
      ( 4, N'Janet', N'United States', N'janet1@adventure-works.com')
   GO
   ```

## Query the table and view the results

The results of a query are visible below the query text window. To query the Customers table and view the rows that were inserted, follow the steps below:

1. Paste the following T-SQL code snippet into the query window, and then select **Execute**:

   ```sql
   -- Select rows from table 'Customers'
   SELECT * FROM dbo.Customers;
   ```

    The results of the query are displayed under the area where the text was entered.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ssms-connect-query-sql-server-azure-vm/query-results.png" alt-text="The Results list":::

    You can also modify the way results are presented by selecting one of the following options:

   ![Three options for displaying query results](media/ssms-connect-query-sql-server-azure-vm/results.png)

   - The first button displays the results in **Text View**, as shown in the image in the next section.
   - The middle button displays the results in **Grid View**, which is the default option.
       - This is set as default
   - The third button lets you save the results to a file whose extension is .rpt by default.

## Verify your connection properties by using the query window table

You can find information about the connection properties under the results of your query. After you run the previously mentioned query in the preceding step, review the connection properties at the bottom of the query window.

- You can determine which server and database you're connected to, and the username that you use.
- You can also view the query duration and the number of rows that are returned by the previously executed query.
