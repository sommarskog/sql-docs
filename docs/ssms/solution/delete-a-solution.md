# Delete a Solution
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]
Deleting a solution permanently erases files from physical storage as well as the file items in the solution.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> In contrast to projects and items, a solution can only be deleted permanently, not removed temporarily.  
  
### To delete a solution  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, select the solution you want to delete.  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, click **Close Solution**.  
  
3.  In [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Explorer, locate and select the files associated with the solution you want to delete.
