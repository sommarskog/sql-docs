# Administer Servers with SQL Server Management Studio

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] SQL Server Management Studio is a rich, integrated administrative client designed to meet the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Azure SQL Database administrator's server management requirements. In Management Studio, administrative tasks are accomplished using Object Explorer, which allows you to connect to any server in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] family and graphically browse its contents. A server can be an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL Database.  
  
The tool components of  Management Studio include Registered Servers, Object Explorer, Solution Explorer, Template Explorer, the Object Explorer Details page, and the document window. To display a tool, on the **View** menu, click the tool name. To display the Query Editor tool, click the **New Query** button on the toolbar.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Network traffic between  Management Studio and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is unencrypted by default. Do not work with sensitive data (including passwords) in  Management Studio unless you have established an encrypted connection. For more information, see [How to: Enable Encrypted Connections to the Database Engine (SQL Server Configuration Manager)](../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-sql-server-encryption.md).  
  
Use  Management Studio to:  
  
- Register servers.  
  
- Connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)], SSAS, [!INCLUDE[ssRS](../includes/ssrs.md)],  [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../includes/ssis-md.md)] or Azure SQL Database.  
  
- Configure server properties.  
  
- Manage database and SSAS objects such as cubes, dimensions, and assemblies.  
  
- Create objects, such as databases, tables, cubes, database users, and logins.  
  
- Manage files and filegroups.  
  
- Attach or detach databases.  
  
- Launch scripting tools.  
  
- Manage security.  
  
- View system logs.  
  
- Monitor current activity.  
  
- Configure replication.  
  
- Manage full-text indexes.  
  
To start and stop [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent, use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager.
