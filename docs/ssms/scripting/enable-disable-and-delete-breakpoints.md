# Enable, Disable, and Delete Breakpoints

 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

To view and manage all the open breakpoints, you can use the **Breakpoints** window. Use the window to view breakpoint information and to take actions such as deleting, disabling, or enabling breakpoints.

[!INCLUDE[ssms-old-versions](../../includes/ssms-old-versions.md)]
  
## The Breakpoints Window  
 The **Breakpoints** window lists information such as which line of code the breakpoint is located on. In the **Breakpoints** window, you can also delete, disable, and enable breakpoints. For more information about the **Breakpoints** window, see [Breakpoints Window](./transact-sql-debugger-breakpoints-window.md)  
  
 Disabling a breakpoint prevents it from pausing execution, but leaves the definition in place in case you want to enable the breakpoint later. Deleting a breakpoint removes it permanently. You must toggle a new breakpoint to pause execution on the statement.
