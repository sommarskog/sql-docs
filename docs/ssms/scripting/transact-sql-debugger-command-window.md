# Transact-SQL Debugger - Command Window

 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Use the **Command Window** to run commands, such as debug and edit commands, against the code in the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] Query Editor window that is currently being debugged. You must be in debug mode to use the **Command Window**. The [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] debugger supports many of the commands that are also supported in the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] **Command** window. For more information, see [Visual Studio Command Window](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2015/ide/reference/command-window).
