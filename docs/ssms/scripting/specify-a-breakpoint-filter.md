# Specify a Breakpoint Filter

 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

A breakpoint filter limits the breakpoint to acting only on specified computers, operating system processes, and threads. Breakpoint filters are typically used when debugging parallel applications.

[!INCLUDE[ssms-old-versions](../../includes/ssms-old-versions.md)]
  
##  <a name="BKMK_ActionConsiderations"></a> Filter Considerations

Breakpoint filters are not typically used with the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] debugger because [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] scripts and stored procedures are not parallel applications.  
  
#### To Specify a Breakpoint Filter  
  
1.  In the editor window, right-click the breakpoint glyph, and then click **Filter** on the shortcut menu.  
  
     -or-  
  
     In the **Breakpoints** window, right-click the breakpoint glyph, and then click **Filter** on the shortcut menu.  
  
2.  In the **Breakpoint Filters** dialog box, use the **Filter** box to specify computers by name, or operating system processes and threads by either name or ID number:  
  
    -   **MachineName** is the computer running the instance of the Database Engine.  
  
    -   **ProcessID**, and **ProcessName** are the operating system process running the instance of the Database Engine.  
  
    -   **ThreadID** and **ThreadName** are the operating system thread running the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] batch, procedure, or function in the instance of the Database Engine.  
  
3.  Click **OK** to implement the changes, or **Cancel** to exit without applying the changes.
