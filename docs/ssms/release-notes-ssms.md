#### Known issues (19.1)

| New Item | Details | Workaround |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Always Encrypted | Always Encrypted Wizard error "Cannot read property AllowEnclaveComputations" occurs for SQL Server 2016 or SQL Server 2017. | Use an earlier version of SSMS (19.02 or 18.12.1) with SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017. |
| Azure SQL Managed Instance | Viewing database properties for a SQL MI database may return the error "Subquery returned more than one value. This isn't permitted when the subquery follows =, !=, <, <=, >, >= or when the subquery is used as an expression. (.NET SqlClient Data Provider)". | There's a known problem due to incorrect data in `msdb`. To resolve, remove back up history. For example, `EXEC`msdb`..sp_delete_backuphistory @oldest_date = '<current date>'`. |
| Database Designer | Selecting the Design option for a view that references a table using spatial data causes SSMS to crash. | Use T-SQL to make changes to the view. |
| General SSMS | Import setting from SSMS 17 option not available. | Settings can be imported from SSMS 18. |
| General SSMS | Upgrading from SSMS 19.0.2 to 19.1 results in some bug fixes not appearing to be resolved.  Specifically, users will still have issues editing a NVARCHAR(255) column in a table, users will see an unknown table name when editing data if the database name in Azure contains a period (.), and SSMS file versions will be incorrect. | Uninstall SSMS 19.1 and then re-install SSMS 19.1. |
| Import/Export Data-Tier Application | Using Export to Data-Tier Application with a Microsoft Azure Storage Account generates the error "An error occurred while loading data." | Use SSMS 19.0.2 or earlier. |
| Object Explorer | Modifying a stored procedure when using Azure AD Authentication generates a "Cannot open server" error. | Use a non-Azure AD login, or SSMS 18.12.1. |
| PolyBase | PolyBase node is not visible in Object Explorer when connecting to SQL 2022. | Use SSMS 18.12.1. |
| Profiler | The Profiler menu isn't localized. | No current alternative. |
| Query Editor | When SSMS opens after double-clicking on a `.sql` file, the Object Explorer window is displayed as a separate window. | No current alternative. |
| Server Audit | Error "Item has already been added. Key in dictionary: 'MNDO'  Key being added: 'MNDO'" when viewing Logs for an Audit. | No current workaround. |
| Stretch DB | Removed Stretch DB Wizard. | Use T-SQL to configure Stretch DB or use SSMS 18.9.1 or earlier to use the Stretch DB Wizard. |
