# Print Query Results (Visual Database Tools)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
To print the results of your query, you can copy the contents of the [Results pane](../../ssms/visual-db-tools/results-pane-visual-database-tools.md) to another Windows program, such as a word processing program, then format and print it there.  
  
The Query and View Designer puts query results onto the Clipboard using tabs as delimiters between columns and carriage return and linefeed characters as delimiters between rows.  
  
### To print query results  
  
1.  Select the columns or rows that you want to print.  
  
2.  Use the **Copy** command to move them to the Clipboard.  
  
3.  Switch to the Windows program you want to use to print the results.  
  
4.  Use the **Paste** command to move the query results from the Clipboard.  
  
5.  Format and print the results.
