# Data Type Change Required Dialog Box (Visual Database Tools)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
Appears when you change the data type, length, scale, precision, or collation of a column that participates in a relationship.  
  
## Options  
**Yes**  
Change the data type property of the related columns shown in the list so that existing relationships are preserved.  
  
**No**  
Cancel the data type change and restore the previous data type to the column you just changed.
