# Display Query and View Designer Panes (Visual Database Tools)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
The Query and View Designer is composed of four separate panes: the Diagram pane, the Criteria pane, the SQL pane, and the Results pane. Typically when you open a view or create a new query all four windows open, but if you need to open any of these windows, you can do so as long as the Query and View Designer is open.  
  
### To display Query and View Designer panes  
  
1.  Open a view or create a new query to open the Query and View Designer.  
  
2.  From the **Query Designer** menu, point to **Pane** and click the name of the pane you want to open.
