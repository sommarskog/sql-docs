# Discard Changes Made to Queries (Visual Database Tools)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
You can discard changes made to a query definition prior to saving them. Once they have been saved, they cannot be returned to a previous state.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> To undo a change you've made to values in the Results pane, press the ESC key before you move off of the record. If you move off of a record and receive a notice that the changes will not be committed to the database you can also press the ESC key to revert to the previous value.  
  
### To discard changes made to a query definition  
  
1.  With the query open in Query and View Designer, from the **File** menu, click **Close**.  
  
2.  In the **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** dialog box, click **No**.  
  
    The query definition will return to the state it was in at the last save.
