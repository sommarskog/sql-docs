# Column List Dialog Box (Visual Database Tools)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
When writing queries, it can be useful to see a list of columns available in your selected table-valued objects.  
  
To access this dialog box, from the **Query Designer** menu, in the Diagram pane right-click the header of a table-valued object, and then click **Properties**. In the **Properties** window, click the **Column List** field. Then click the ellipses **(...)** to the right of the field.  
  
This dialog box provides a list of the columns in the selected table-valued object and basic properties, such as data types and whether the columns allow null values.  
  
## Options  
**Name**  
Shows the name of the columns in the selected table-valued object.  
  
**Data Type**  
Shows the data types for each of the columns in the selected table-valued object.  
  
**Data Type Properties**  
Shows data type properties for each of the columns in the selected table-valued object. The possibilities are NULLABLE, IDENTITY, ROWGUID, and blank.
