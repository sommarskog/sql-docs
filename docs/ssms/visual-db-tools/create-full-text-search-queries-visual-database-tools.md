# Create Full-Text Search Queries (Visual Database Tools)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
Full-text searches use the CONTAINS predicate to locate rows that have specified text in a given column. Full-Text searches are only possible on columns that have active full-text indexes. If you attempt to use the CONTAINS clause on a column that does not have a currently active full-text index, you will receive an error. For more information on full-text indexes and the CONTAINS clause, see [Full-Text Search (SQL Server)](../../relational-databases/search/full-text-search.md) and [CONTAINS (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/queries/contains-transact-sql.md).  
  
### To create a full-text search query  
  
1.  Open a query from Solution Explorer or create a new one.  
  
2.  In the WHERE clause of your query, use the CONTAINS function to search a full-text column.
