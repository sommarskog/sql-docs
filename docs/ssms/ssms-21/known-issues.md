# Known issues in SQL Server Management Studio 21 Preview

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa.md)]

This page lists known issues for [!INCLUDE [ssms-21-md](../includes/ssms-21-md.md)].

| Feature | Details | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Analysis Services | There's currently no support for Analysis Services in [!INCLUDE [ssms-21-md](../includes/ssms-21-md.md)]. | Use SSMS 20.2 to connect to Analysis Services, we'll bring back Analysis Services in a future preview. |
| Arm64 | There's no support for Arm64, and SSMS can't be installed on Arm64 devices. | Run SSMS on a device that isn't Arm64. |
| Database Diagrams | Closing a new database diagram before saving generates the error "Object reference not set to an instance of an object. (SqlEditors)". | Save the new database diagram before closing the editor in Database Diagrams. |
| Designers | Closing the view editor before saving in the View Designer generates the error "Object reference not set to an instance of an object. (SqlEditors)". | Save the new view before closing the editor in the View Designer. |
| Designers | The JSON data type is not available for columns when creating or editing a table in Table Designer. See [SSMS 21.0 Preview 2.0 - Table Designer missing the "json" datatype](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/idea/d2e6f106-9fb8-ef11-95f5-6045bdbfaf80).| Use T-SQL to add columns with the JSON data type, this functionality will be available in a later release. |
| Designers | Unable to use SSMS after closing the **New View** pane when the **Add Table** dialog is left open. See [SSMS 21 Preview 1: New View window "Add Table" not aware I closed out of New View](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/idea/8790c2c0-22a8-ef11-95f6-000d3a01397d). | Close the **Add Table** dialog before closing the view pane. |
| Extended Events | The Specify Data Storage page is truncated in the Extended Events Wizard. See [Extended Events Wizard is cut off on Specify Data Storage page](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/idea/e7de428c-76ab-ef11-95f6-000d3a01397d). | Use the **New Session...** option to create an Extended Events session. |
| Find | The **Quick Find** option is not available. Typically accessed through **Edit** > **Find and Replace** > **Quick Find**, or with **CTRL + F**, the full **Find and Replace** appears instead. See [SSMS 21.0 Preview 1.0 - "Quick Find" missing, instead "Find in files" pops up](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/idea/76326fd1-57b6-ef11-95f6-000d3ae2b698). | There's currently no workaround in SSMS 21 Preview. |
| Integration Services | There's currently no support for Integration Services in [!INCLUDE [ssms-21-md](../includes/ssms-21-md.md)]. | Use SSMS 20.2 to connect to Integration Services, we'll bring back Integration Services in a future preview. |
| IntelliSense | Disabling IntelliSense by unchecking **Enable IntelliSense** in **Tools** > **Options** > **Text Editor** > **Transact-SQL** > **IntelliSense** does not persist between restarts of SSMS. | Use SSMS 20.2 if you need IntelliSense disabled. This will be fixed in a future preview. |
| License | The "Microsoft Software License Terms" link in the Visual Studio Install splash screen doesn't access a valid URL. | Access the license for SSMS 21 from the "license" link within the Visual Studio Installer, available when customizing the SSMS 21 installation. |
| Logins | Unable to map a credential for a login. See [SSMS v21 Preview 1 - Bug in Login Properties for Credentials](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/idea/e0687671-dca3-ef11-95f6-000d3a059eeb). | Use T-SQL to map a login to a credential. |
| Maintenance Plans | There's currently no support for creating or editing maintenance plans in [!INCLUDE [ssms-21-md](../includes/ssms-21-md.md)]. | Use SSMS 20.2 to create or edit maintenance plans, we'll bring back Integration Services in a future preview. |
| Menu | Opening a folder from **File** > **Recent Projects and Solutions** generates one of the following errors: "System.InvalidOperationException: Can't enque project dependencies calculation before starting solution load" or "An exception of type NullReferenceException has been encountered." if opening the folder also opens one or more files that were open in the editor when the folder was last closed. | Closing the error allows work to continue. Alternatively, close all files in the editor before closing a folder. |
| Menu | The **File** > **Add** > **New Project or Existing Project** menu option isn't available. | Use SSMS 20.2 to create a new project or open an existing one. |
| Menu | The **File** > **File** menu option isn't available. | Use **File** > **New Query with current connection** or the New Query button to open a new query editor. |
| Menu | The **File** > **Open** > **Project/Solution** menu option isn't available. | Use SSMS 20.2 to open an existing project or solution. |

| Terminal | Using **Developer PowerShell** or **Developer Command Prompt** from **View** > **Terminal** generates an error. See [SSMS 21 Preview - Visual Studio developer prompt options should probably be hidden or removed](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/idea/b592405d-cbaa-ef11-95f6-000d3a01397d). | Customize the file that launches through customize what launches in SSMS, through **Tools** > **Options** > **Environment** > **Terminal**. We will fix this in a future release. |
| Version | The version of SSMS listed in the Visual Studio Installer for Preview 2.1 doesn't match the version listed in **Help** > **About**. | There is no workaround and this will be resolved in a future preview. |
