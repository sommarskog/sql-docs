# Get Full Memory Dump

[!INCLUDE[Applies to](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-xxx-md.md)]

In this article, you learn how to capture diagnostic information to troubleshoot a crash or a unresponsive system that you experienced from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

To capture diagnostic information to troubleshoot, follow the steps below.

1. Download [ProcDump](/sysinternals/downloads/procdump).

2. Unzip the download into a folder.

3. Open a Command Prompt (such as `cmd.exe`), and run the following command.

    ```console
    <PathToProcDumpFolder>\procdump.exe -e -h -ma -w ssms.exe
    ```

    It should prompt you to accept a license agreement, select **Agree**.

4. Start SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) if not started already.

5. Reproduce your issue.

6. The text should appear in the cmd prompt about writing the dump file, wait for that to finish.

7. Create a new folder and copy the *.dmp file that is written out to that folder.

8. Copy the following files into the same folder.

    * "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\mscordacwks.dll"
    * "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\SOS.dll"
    * "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\clr.dll"
