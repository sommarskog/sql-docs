# Using Test Repositories (SybaseToSQL)

The SSMA Test Repository stores SSMA Tester test cases and test results for later use. The Repository data is saved locally along side the SSMA project.

The following buttons are available on the Repository of Test Cases dialog box:

- Click the **Refresh** button to refresh the Test Cases or Test Results list.
- Click the **Close** button to close Repository of Test Cases dialog box.

## Test Cases Repository

You can view the Test Cases Repository by clicking **Test Cases...** from the **Tester** menu. SSMA then displays the **Repository of Test Cases** dialog window with a list of saved test cases on the **Test Cases** page.

The grid shows the following information about each test case:

- **Name**: The test case name.
- **Created**: The test case creation date.
- **Modified**: The test case last modification date.
- **Description**: The test case descriptions.

The following buttons are available on **Test Cases** page:

- Click the **Add** button to run the Test Case Wizard and create a new test.
- Click the **Remove** button to delete the selected test from the repository. When a Test Case is deleted, all related Test Results are also deleted.
- Click the **Edit** button to run the Test Case Wizard and change the selected test.
- Click the **Run** button to open the [Running Test Cases &#40;SybaseToSQL&#41;](../../ssma/sybase/running-test-cases-sybasetosql.md) dialog and execute the selected test.

## Test Results Repository

You can view the Test Results Repository on the **Test Results** page of the **Repository of Test Cases** window. Open it by clicking **Test Results...** from the **Tester** menu.

You can use two filters on **Test Results** page:

- The Test Case Name filter: Allows choosing test results by test case name. This filter's **All Test Case** value allows displaying test results for all test cases.
- The Test Case Execution Date filter: Filters test results by the date of saving.This filter's **All Period** value allows displaying test results for any date of saving.

The following information about test results is displayed in the grid.

- **Name**: Test case name.
- **Started**: Test case date of running.
- **Result**: A short summary of test execution (this cell's tool tip displays a full summary of test execution).

The following buttons are available on **Test Result** page:

- Click the **View** button to open [Viewing Test Case Reports &#40;SybaseToSQL&#41;](../../ssma/sybase/viewing-test-case-reports-sybasetosql.md) of current Test Case Result.
- Click the **Delete** button to delete the selected Test Result.
