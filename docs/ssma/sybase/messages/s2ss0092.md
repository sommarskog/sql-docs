# S2SS0092: The conversion for provided date format is not supported (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Sybase does not convert a call to CONVERT function with specified style argument

## Background

Whenever there is a call to the `CONVERT` function to or from date/time data types SSMA will try to translate it appropriately. Sybase/SAP ASE and SQL Server support different date and time formats, thus there might be values of `format-style` (third) argument that do not have direct mapping in SQL Server. SSMA tries to emulate some of these styles by using explicit `FORMAT` function call, but there still might be format styles that SSMA cannot convert.

## Example

Consider the example below, in which we are trying to format date value using style `30`:

```sql
SELECT
  CONVERT(VARCHAR(20), [StartDate], 30) AS [StartDate]
FROM
  [Employees]
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> S2SS0092: The conversion for provided date format is not supported

## Possible remedies

To resolve this error, you can use `FORMAT` function with the desired format:

```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT([StartDate], 'dd \d MM \m yyyy \y') AS [StartDate]
FROM
  [Employees]
```
