# SQL Server Migration Assistant for DB2 (DB2ToSQL)

[!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for DB2 is a tool for migrating DB2 databases to [!INCLUDE [sssql11-md](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] on Windows and Linux, or [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]. SSMA for DB2 converts DB2 database objects to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL objects, loads those objects into [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL, and then migrates data from DB2 to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL.
