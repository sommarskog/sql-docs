# Installing SSMA for DB2 client (DB2ToSQL)

The SSMA client consists of the program files that perform the following tasks:

- Connect to a DB2 database.
- Connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
- Convert DB2 database objects to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] syntax.
- Load the objects into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
- Migrate data to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

This topic provides the installation prerequisites and instructions for installing SSMA.

## Prerequisites

SSMA is designed to work with DB2 on z/OS version 9.0 and 10.0, DB2 on LUW version 9.8 and 10.1 or later versions, DB2 for i version 7.1 or greater and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2012 or later versions.

Before you install SSMA, make sure that the computer meets the following requirements:

- Windows 7 or later versions, or Windows Server 2008 or later versions.
- [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Installer 3.1 or later versions.
- The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] version 4.7.2 or a later version. You can obtain it from the [.NET Framework Developer Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=48882).
- Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 version 5 or a later version, and connectivity to the DB2 databases that you want to migrate.
- Access to and sufficient permissions on the computer that hosts the target instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL Database where you will be migrating database objects and data. For more information, see [Connecting to SQL Server &#40;DB2ToSQL&#41;](../../ssma/db2/connecting-to-sql-server-db2tosql.md).
- 4 GB RAM recommended.
