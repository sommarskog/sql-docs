# Working with SSMA for MySQL Console (MySQLToSQL)
[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for MySQL is now accessible through a console application at command line. The script files form the input to the application for executing the commands. As a console application, SSMA enables script-level interfacing, reduces the migration cycle, and scales the migration effort.  
  
This section explains the procedure to migrate the MySQL database using the SSMA Console application.  
  
Topics covered in this section include:
