# Viewing Test Case Reports (OracleToSQL)
The Test Case Report shows the test verification results and general test information. In case of a test failure, information about any mismatched data in verified objects is also displayed.  
  
## Report Structure  
The top of the report shows these statistics:  
  
-   The total number of tested objects and the number of objects for which the test was successful.  
  
-   The total number of verified tables and foreign keys, and the number of tables and foreign keys successfully matched.  
  
-   The Start time, End time of the test case and the total time taken for execution.  
  
The rest of the report shows information in four categories:  
  
**Prerequisites Errors**  
Shows any errors that occurred at the **Prerequisites step.** Normally, it is skipped.  
  
**Initialization**  
Shows the status of execution as **Success** or **Failure**.  
  
**Test objects result**  
A comparison of results (success or failure) and the mismatches that SSMA Tester detected in case of failure.  
  
**Finalization**  
Shows the status of execution as **Success** or **Failure**.
