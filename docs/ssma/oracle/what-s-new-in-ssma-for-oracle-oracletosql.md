  >
  > ![SSMA for Oracle Extension Pack](../media/ssma-oracle-ext-pack.png)

  Some features, including Tester and Server-side data migration, are not supported when targeting Azure SQL Managed Instance. Read more about it [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/datamigration/2019/02/17/migrate-your-oracle-database-to-azure-sql-database-managed-instance-using-ssma-8-0/).

* Post-conversion **Fix advisor**. Learn more about it [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/datamigration/2019/02/17/%20accelerate-your-oracle-migrations-with-new-machine-learning-capabilities-in-ssma/).

* Preliminary database/schema selection.

  When connecting to the source, the user can now select databases/schemas of interest. Selecting only the schemas that you plan to migrate will save time during initial connection and improve overall SSMA performance.

  ![SSMA filter objects](../media/ssma-filter-objects.png)

* SQL Server 2017 support is now official with the Oracle Extension Pack supported on Linux as well (new remote installation option). Note that Extension Pack functionality is limited when installed on Linux, as the tester and server-side data migration features aren't supported.
* SSMA for Oracle allows you to migrate Materialized Views as regular tables (configurable through the settings at **Project Settings** -> **Synchronization** -> **Discover backing tables for Materialized Views**).

## SSMA v7.6

The v7.6 release of SSMA for Oracle is enhanced with targeted fixes that improve quality and conversion metrics and with support for SQL Server 2017 (public preview). Support for SQL Server 2017 on Windows and Linux is in public preview and shouldn't be used for production migrations.

  ![query timeout option](../media/query-timeout_red.png)

* The quality and conversion metric has been improved with targeted fixes, based on customer feedback.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> .NET 4.5.2 is a pre-requisite for installing SSMA v7.4. In addition, beginning with v7.4, the 32-bit version of SSMA is being discontinued.

## SSMA v7.3

* Improved quality and conversion metric with targeted fixes based on customer feedback.
* SSMA extensibility framework exposed via the following items:
  * Export functionality to a SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) project.

      ![Save as SSDT project command](../media/export-schema-scripts_red.png)
  * Libraries that can be consumed by SSMA for performing custom conversions.
    * You can now construct code that can handle custom syntax conversions and conversions that weren't previously handled by SSMA.
