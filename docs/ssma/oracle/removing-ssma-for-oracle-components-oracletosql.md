# Removing SSMA  for Oracle Components (OracleToSQL)
When you have finished migrating databases from Oracle to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you might want to uninstall SSMA components. You can uninstall the client components at any time. However, you should not uninstall the extension pack from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] unless your migrated databases no longer use functions in the **ssma_oracle** schema of the **sysdb** database.  
  
## Uninstalling the SSMA for Oracle Client  
You can uninstall SSMA by using **Add or Remove Programs**.  
  
**To uninstall SSMA**  
  
1.  In Control Panel, open **Add or Remove Programs**.  
  
2.  Select **[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant for Oracle**, and then click **Remove**.  
  
3.  To confirm that you want to uninstall SSMA, click **Yes**.  
  
## Uninstalling the Extension Pack  
If you are sure your migrated databases do not use objects in the **sysdb.ssma_oracle** schema, you can remove the extension pack by using **Add or Remove Programs**.  
  
**To uninstall the extension pack**  
  
1.  In Control Panel, open **Add or Remove Programs**.  
  
2.  Select **Microsoft SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle Extension Pack**, and then click **Remove**.  
  
3.  To confirm that you want to uninstall the extension pack, click **Yes**.  
  
4.  On the Instances with Utilities Database Scripts page, select an instance and then click **Next**.  
  
5.  On the Connection Parameters page, select the authentication method, and then click **Next**.  
  
    Windows Authentication will use your Windows credentials to try to log on to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. If you select [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication, you must enter a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login name and password.  
  
6.  On the Operation Completed page, click **OK**.  
  
7.  On the Finish page, click **Exit**.  
  
After the uninstall, you can confirm that objects in the **sysdb.ssma_oracle** schema, and possibly the whole **sysdb** database, has been removed by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. However, if you use other SSMA products, they also use the **sysdb** database. If the database exists and you are sure that no other databases reference objects in this database, you can detach the database.
