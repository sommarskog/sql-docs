# SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle (OracleToSQL)

[!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle is a tool for migrating Oracle databases to [!INCLUDE [sssql11-md](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] on Windows and Linux, or [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]. SSMA for Oracle converts Oracle database objects to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL objects, loads those objects into [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL, and then migrates data from Oracle to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL.

This documentation introduces you to SSMA for Oracle and provides step-by-step instructions for migrating Oracle databases to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The following table shows articles to help you learn more:
