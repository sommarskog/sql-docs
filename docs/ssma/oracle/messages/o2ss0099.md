# O2SS0099: ROWNUM in ORDER BY clause is not supported (Error)

This article covers some of the reasons why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle cannot convert a statement that contains the Oracle `ROWNUM` in `ORDER BY` clause.

## Background

The Oracle `ROWNUM` pseudocolumn returns a number indicating the order in which a row was selected from a table. The first row selected has a `ROWNUM` of `1`; the second row has a `ROWNUM` of `2`, and so on.

When converting the `ROWNUM` in `ORDER BY` clause, SSMA uses the `ROW_NUMBER()` emulation technique in most cases without error. However, if the `ORDER BY` clause is used as part of a `UNION` query, SSMA generates an error message.

## Example

Consider the following example:

```sql
SELECT city
FROM customers

UNION

SELECT city
FROM employees
ORDER BY ROWNUM;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0099: ROWNUM in ORDER BY clause is not supported

## Possible remedies

The solution is to simplify the expression by creating a sub query using parenthesis. Creating the sub query will separate the `ROWNUM` in `ORDER BY` clause with the `UNION` clause making it a simpler expression. Below is the example of the simplified query:

```sql
SELECT
    city
FROM
    (SELECT city FROM customers
     UNION
     SELECT city FROM employees)
ORDER BY
    ROWNUM;
```

* O2SS0039: ROWNUM pseudocolumn cannot be converted
* O2SS0081: Unsupported asterisk and ROWNUM in SELECT statements
* O2SS0412: ROWNUM with GROUPING SETS cannot be converted

In most of these situations, consider what the query is trying to accomplish and rewrite it to use the `ROW_NUMBER()` emulation, `TOP` clause, or use a unique expression for your `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, or `ORDER BY` clauses.
