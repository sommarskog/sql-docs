# O2SS0157: Dynamic string for OPEN...FOR not converted (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle does not convert the dynamic string within an `OPEN ... FOR` statement.

## Background

The `OPEN-FOR` statement implements the query associated with a cursor variable and assigns database resources to process the query and recognizes the result set. A `CURSOR` is a mechanism by which you can assign a name to a `SELECT` statement and manipulate the information within that SQL statement.

In order to convert the `OPEN ... FOR` cursor using SSMA, first you need to set the parameters in the SSMA project settings. Details about the relevant project settings are available in the article about [O2SS0094](o2ss0094.md) error message.

If you have any dynamic string in your code, the SSMA tool will generate an error message.

## Example

Consider the below example that you might find in an Oracle procedure:

```sql
DECLARE
    emp_refcur SYS_REFCURSOR;
BEGIN
    OPEN
        emp_refcur
    FOR
        'SELECT ename FROM emp';

    CLOSE emp_refcur;
END;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0157: Dynamic string for OPEN...FOR not converted

## Possible remedies

There are two possible remedies for correcting the dynamic string error.

### First approach

Remove the single quotes from the dynamic query to make it a static query and run SSMA against the code again. Below is the modified Oracle code:

```sql
DECLARE
    emp_refcur SYS_REFCURSOR;
BEGIN
    OPEN
        emp_refcur
    FOR
        SELECT ename FROM emp;

    CLOSE emp_refcur;
END;
```

SSMA will generate the following block of Transact-SQL code:

```sql
BEGIN
    DECLARE
        @emp_refcur CURSOR

    SET @emp_refcur =
        CURSOR FOR
            SELECT EMP.ENAME
            FROM dbo.EMP

    OPEN @emp_refcur
END
```

### Second approach

Another way to solve this error is to use the natural approach followed in SQL Server which is â€“ returning the result set directly from executing stored procedures. In this approach, unlike Oracle, there is no need of using any cursor as output parameters.

To demonstrate this, let's take the modified code from the first approach:

```sql
DECLARE
    emp_refcur SYS_REFCURSOR;
BEGIN
    OPEN
        emp_refcur
    FOR
        SELECT ename FROM emp;

    CLOSE emp_refcur;
END;
```

SSMA generates the SQL code, that will simply return a cursor, which carries the reference of the values in the `ename` column of the `emp` table.

SQL Server stored procedures are designed to return one or more result sets without having to define a cursor to handle the results. By executing the query used for the Oracle cursor inside of the stored procedure, you can process the result set in your application code.

Consider the following Transact-SQL stored procedure that can emulate the original Oracle dynamic SQL example:

```sql
ALTER PROCEDURE dbo.P_CURSOR_PROC
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE
        @query nvarchar(max)

    SET @query = 'SELECT ename FROM emp'

    EXECUTE sp_executesql @query
END
```
