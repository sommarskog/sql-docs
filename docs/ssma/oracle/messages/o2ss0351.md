# O2SS0351: Conversion of collection method not supported (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle does not support the conversion of some of the collection method.

## Background

A collection is an ordered group of elements, all of the same type. It is a general concept that encompasses lists, arrays, and other familiar data types. You can use the methods `EXISTS`, `COUNT`, `LIMIT`, `FIRST`, `LAST`, `PRIOR`, `NEXT`, `EXTEND`, `TRIM`, and `DELETE` to manage collections in Oracle whose size is unknown or varies.

Whenever you make a reference of `LIMIT` method in collection query, SSMA is not able to resolve that method. Hence, usage of this collection method results in an error message. In Oracle, `LIMIT` returns the maximum number of elements that array can contain (which you must specify in its type definition).

## Example

Consider the below example:

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE VARRAYTEST IS VARRAY(5) OF VARCHAR2(25);
    vTest VARRAYTEST;
BEGIN
    vTest := VARRAYTEST('text1', 'text2', 'text3');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('COLLECTION LIMIT IS -- ' || vTest.LIMIT);
END;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0351: Conversion of collection method not supported

## Possible remedies

The solution to the above error is to modify the code in SQL Server because `LIMIT` method is not relevant in the way SSMA emulates the collection. When SSMA converts the array collection element of Oracle to SQL Server, it allocates the maximum size to the collection element and SQL Server allows dynamic allocation to the collection at the run time.

So for the above example, we have replaced the `LIMIT` method with `Count` method of SQL Server to get the number of elements in collection

```sql
BEGIN
    DECLARE
        @CollectionIndexInt$TYPE varchar(max) = ' VARRAY OF STRING',
        @vTest dbo.CollectionIndexInt

    SET @vTest =
        dbo.CollectionIndexInt::[Null]
            .SetType(@CollectionIndexInt$TYPE)
            .AddString('text1')
            .AddString('text2')
            .AddString('text3')

    PRINT 'COLLECTION LIMIT IS -- ' + ISNULL(CAST(@vTest.Count AS nvarchar(max)), '')
END
```
