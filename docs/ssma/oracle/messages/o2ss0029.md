# O2SS0029: Cannot convert EXIT statement (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle doesn't convert the EXIT statement when an outer loop is exited from inside the scope of inner loop.

## Background

The `LOOP` statement is used to define a loop with an indeterminate number of iterations. The `EXIT` statement exits a loop and transfers control immediately to the end of the loop.

Whenever an outer loop is exited from inside the scope of inner loop, SSMA cannot always convert the `EXIT` statement and generates a conversion error.

## Example

Consider the example below in which outer loop is exited from inside the scope of inner loop:

```sql
DECLARE
    s PLS_INTEGER := 0;
    i PLS_INTEGER := 0;
    j PLS_INTEGER;
BEGIN
    <<outer_loop>>
    LOOP
        i := i + 1;
        j := 0;

        <<inner_loop>>
        LOOP
            j := j + 1;
            s := s + i * j; -- sum a bunch of products

            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('i: ' || TO_CHAR(i));
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('j: ' || TO_CHAR(j));
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('s: ' || TO_CHAR(s));

            EXIT inner_loop WHEN (j > 5);
            EXIT outer_loop WHEN ((i * j) > 15);
        END LOOP inner_loop;
    END LOOP outer_loop;

    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The sum of products equals: ' || TO_CHAR(s));
END;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0029: Cannot convert EXIT statement

## Possible remedies

The solution to the above problem is to use statement labels and `GOTO` to break out of the outer loop. Define an `OUTER_LOOP_END` label right after the loop and use `GOTO OUTER_LOOP_END` instead of `BREAK` to break out of the outer loop:

```sql
DECLARE
    @S int = 0,
    @I int = 0,
    @J int

OUTER_LOOP:
WHILE 1 = 1
BEGIN
    SET @I = @I + 1
    SET @J = 0

    INNER_LOOP:
    WHILE 1 = 1
    BEGIN
        SET @J = @J + 1
        SET @S = @S + @I * @J /* sum a bunch of products*/

        PRINT 'i: ' + ISNULL(CAST(@I AS varchar(max)), '')
        PRINT 'j: ' + ISNULL(CAST(@J AS varchar(max)), '')
        PRINT 's: ' + ISNULL(CAST(@S AS varchar(max)), '')

        IF (@J > 5)
            BREAK

        IF ((@I * @J) > 15)
            GOTO OUTER_LOOP_END
    END
END
OUTER_LOOP_END:

PRINT 'The sum of products equals: ' + ISNULL(CAST(@S AS varchar(max)), '')
```
