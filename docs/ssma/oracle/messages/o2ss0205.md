# O2SS0205: Unable to convert PRAGMA AUTONOMUS_TRANSACTION (Error)

This article covers some of the reasons why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle does not convert the PL/SQL blocks containing `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` statement on the block level (i.e. standalone `BEGIN ... END`).

## Background

*Autonomous Transactions* allow you to create a new sub-transaction that may commit or rollback changes independent of the parent transaction. `PRAGMA` refers to a compiler directive and it is used to provide an instruction to the compiler.

In Oracle, when you define a PL/SQL block as an *Autonomous Transaction*, it isolates the DML in that block from the caller's transaction context. The block becomes an independent transaction started by another transaction, referred to as the main transaction. To mark a PL/SQL block as an autonomous transaction, simply include the following statement in your declaration section:

```sql
PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
```

In the above statement, `PRAGMA` can perform an autonomous transaction within a PL/SQL block between a `BEGIN` and `END` statement without affecting the entire transaction.

Whenever SSMA tries to convert the PL/SQL block with `PRAGMA AUTONOMUS_TRANSACTION` statement (i.e. standalone `BEGIN ... END`), it does not support `PRAGMA` on the block level. This is because SSMA cannot find its corresponding object in the SQL Server. But SSMA can convert autonomous transactions at the routine level (i.e. for procedures, functions etc.).

## Example

Consider the following example:

```sql
DECLARE
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 3 .. 10 LOOP
        INSERT INTO at_test (id, description)
        VALUES (i, 'Description for ' || i);
    END LOOP;

    COMMIT;
END;
```

When SSMA tries to convert the above PL/SQL block, it gives following error:

> O2SS0205: Unable to convert PRAGMA AUTONOMUS_TRANSACTION

## Possible remedies

To convert a PL/SQL block with an `AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` statement, it is recommended to wrap the code into a procedure, function, or trigger. In the above example, you can define a procedure to insert the data into the `at_test` table as an autonomous transaction. The solution to the above issue is as following:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE Insert_Data
AS
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 3 .. 10 LOOP
        INSERT INTO at_test (id, description)
        VALUES (i, 'Description for ' || i);
    END LOOP;

    COMMIT;
END;
```

## How SSMA Converts an Autonomous Transaction

To convert the above *Autonomous Transaction* statement, SSMA uses the extended stored procedure emulator `xp_ora2ms_exec2_ex`. After creating the autonomous block as separate procedure, SSMA calls this procedure using the `xp_ora2ms_exec2_ex` emulator as shown below.

```sql
BEGIN
    DECLARE
        @active_spid INT,
        @login_time DATETIME

    SET @active_spid = ssma_oracle.get_active_spid()
    SET @login_time = ssma_oracle.get_active_login_time()

    EXECUTE master.dbo.xp_ora2ms_exec2_ex
        @active_spid,
        @login_time,
        DB_NAME(),
        N'DBO',
        N'INSERT_DATA$IMPL',
        N'false'
END
```

Internally `xp_ora2ms_exec2_ex` connects back to the same instance of SQL Server using current credentials and executes the given stored procedure (`INSERT_DATA$IMPL` in the sample above). Since it is a separate connection, modifications done by the executed stored procedure can be committed or rolled back separately from the calling transaction.

Since new connection has to be opened to SQL Server, such conversion is relatively slow, compared to native Oracle implementations. Whenever possible it is recommended to rewrite the code without the *Autonomous Transaction*.
