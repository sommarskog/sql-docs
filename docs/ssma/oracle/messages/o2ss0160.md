# O2SS0160: SELECT statement not converted (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle does not convert the `SELECT` statement in two scenarios that have ill formed `ORDER BY` clauses.

## Background

There are cases when SSMA cannot convert complex `SELECT` statements.

## Possible remedies

There are two scenarios, in which SSMA doesn't convert the select statement and generate an error message.

### Scenario 1: `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is used with `CONNECT BY PRIOR` statement in the hierarchical query

Consider the example below:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    empno,
    MGR,
    ename
FROM
    emp
START WITH MGR = 7902
CONNECT BY PRIOR MGR = empno;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0160: SELECT statement not converted

To resolve the above issue, you can use the `ORDER BY` clause in the source code of Oracle, as shown below:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    empno,
    MGR,
    ename
FROM
    emp
START WITH MGR = 7902
CONNECT BY PRIOR MGR = empno
ORDER BY empno;
```

Above query should be converted successfully by SSMA.

### Scenario 2: `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set based on the two columns/fields but you have specified only one column/field in `SELECT` clause

Consider the example below:

```sql
SELECT Empno
FROM emp
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0160: SELECT statement not converted

To solve this error either reduce the number of field/column in `ORDER BY` clause or add additional fields/columns in `SELECT` clause.

Here is updated query where we removed second column reference from the `ORDER BY`:

```sql
SELECT Deptno
FROM emp
ORDER BY 1;
```

Above query should be converted successfully by SSMA.
