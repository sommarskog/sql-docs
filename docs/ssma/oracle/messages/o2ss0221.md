# O2SS0221: Call to identity sequence NEXTVAL not supported (Error)

This article covers some of the reasons why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle does not convert procedures with reference to sequence's `NEXTVAL` function.

## Background

A `SEQUENCE` is an independent database object in Oracle, which automatically creates unique integers typically for primary key/foreign values. A `NEXTVAL` is used to access the next value of the specified sequence.

When converting `SEQUENCE` objects, SSMA can use two techniques namely, **Sequence to Sequence** and **Sequence to Identity**. When converting to sequence, SSMA will create a corresponding `SEQUENCE` object in the SQL Server schema for each Oracle sequence. In the **Sequence to Identity** mode, SSMA does not create any `SEQUENCE` objects in SQL Server thus calls to `NEXTVAL` for the Oracle sequence will result in an error message.

## Example

Consider the following example:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE proc1
AS
    t1 NUMBER;
BEGIN
    SELECT customers_seq.NEXTVAL INTO t1 FROM DUAL;
END;
```

Here we have a stored procedure that attempts to retrieve next value for the sequence `customers_seq`. If **Sequence to Identity** mode is used in SSMA, then the following error message will be produced:

> O2SS0221: Call to identity sequence NEXTVAL not supported

## Possible remedies

To resolve this error you can either rewrite the PL/SQL code to eliminate access to `NEXTVAL` or change SSMA project settings to produce `SEQUENCE` objects in SQL Server, instead of identity columns. To do the later:

1. Click the **Tools** menu and select **Project Settings**.
2. Then, click the **General** tab.
3. Now, under **Sequence conversion** group set **Convert Sequence Generator** to **Using SQL Server sequence generator**.
4. Apply these settings and click **OK**.
