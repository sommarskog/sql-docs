# O2SS0054: Unable to convert EXCEPTION_INIT (Error)

This article covers the reason why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle cannot convert `EXCEPTION_INIT`.

## Background

Exception handling is a programming language construct or mechanism designed to handle the occurrence of exceptions, special conditions that change the normal flow of program execution. One can use the `PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT` to associate exception names with other Oracle error codes that one can anticipate.

Whenever you try to convert PL/SQL code having an `EXCEPTION_INIT` clause with a user defined exception name in it, SSMA is unable to convert `EXCEPTION_INIT` because it doesn't find an exception with the same name in the parameter section.

## Example

Consider the following example:

```sql
DECLARE
    MYEXCEPTION EXCEPTION;
    PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(MYEXCEPTION_1, -20000);
BEGIN
    NULL;
END;
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is a bad code example of Oracle, as Oracle also generates an error message when you try to execute this code.

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it does not identify the user defined exception `MYEXCEPTION_1` and hence generates the following error message:

> O2SS0054: Unable to convert EXCEPTION_INIT

## Possible remedies

Remediation of this error is to use the same name while declaring and defining an exception. For this, update the code as follows:

```sql
DECLARE
    MYEXCEPTION EXCEPTION;
    PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(MYEXCEPTION, -20000);
BEGIN
    NULL;
END;
```
