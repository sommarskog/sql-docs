# Export an Access inventory (AccessToSQL)

If you have multiple Access databases and you aren't sure which ones to migrate into [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can export an inventory of all Access databases in a project. You can then review and query the inventory metadata to determine which databases and objects within those databases to migrate. This inventory lets you quickly find answers to questions, such as the following list:

- What are the largest databases?
- Who owns most of the databases?
- Which databases contain the same tables?
- Which databases haven't been modified in the last six months?
- Which databases contain private information?

Query examples that are used to answer these questions are provided at the end of this article.

## Exported metadata

SSMA exports metadata about Access databases, tables, columns, indexes, foreign keys, queries, reports, forms, macros, and modules. Metadata about each of these categories of items is exported to a separate table. For schemas of these tables, see [Access Inventory Schemas](access-inventory-schemas-accesstosql.md).

## Export Inventory Data

To export an Access inventory, you must first open or create an SSMA project, and then add the Access database that you want to analyze. After you add databases to an SSMA project, you export metadata about those databases to a specified [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database and schema. If necessary, SSMA creates tables to store the metadata. SSMA then adds the metadata about the Access databases to the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database.

> [!NOTE]  
> An Access database can be split into multiple files: a back-end database that contains tables and front-end databases that contain queries, forms, reports, macros, modules, and shortcuts. If you want to migrate a split database to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], add the front-end database to SSMA.

The following instructions describe how to create a project, add databases to the project, connect to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and then export inventory data.

#### Create a project

1. Open SSMA for Access.

1. On the **File** menu, select **New Project**.

    The **New Project** dialog box appears.

1. In the **Name** box, enter a name for your project.

1. In the **Location** box, enter or select a folder for the project.

1. In the **Migrate To** combo box, select the target version to which you want to migrate, and then select **OK**.

For more information about creating projects, see [Creating and Managing Projects](creating-and-managing-projects-accesstosql.md).

#### Find and add databases

1. On the **File** menu, select **Find Databases**.

1. In the Find Databases Wizard, enter the drive, file path, or the UNC path that you want to search. Alternatively, select **Browse** to select the drive or network folder.

1. Select **Add** to add the location to the list box.

   Repeat the previous two steps to add additional search locations.

1. Optionally, add search criteria to refine the list of databases that are returned.

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > The **All or part of the file name** text box does not support wildcard characters.

1. Select **Scan**.

   The Scan page appears. This shows the databases that have been found and the search progress. To stop the search, select **Stop**.

1. On the Select Files page, select each database that you want to add to the project.

   You can use the **Select All** and **Clear All** buttons at the top of the list to select or clear all databases. You can also hold the CTRL key down to select multiple rows, or hold the SHIFT key down to select a range of rows.

1. Select **Next**.

1. On the Verify page, select **Finish**.

For more information about adding databases to projects, see [Adding and Removing Access Database Files](adding-and-removing-access-database-files-accesstosql.md).

#### Connect to SQL Server

1. On the **File** menu, select **Connect to SQL Server**.

1. In the connection dialog box, enter or select the name of the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

   - If you are connecting to the default instance on the local computer, you can enter **localhost** or a dot (**.**).

   - If you are connecting to the default instance on another computer, enter the name of the computer.

   - If you are connecting to a named instance, enter the computer name, a backslash, and the instance name. For example: MyServer\MyInstance.

1. In the **Database** box, enter the name of the target database for exported metadata.

1. If your instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is configured to accept connections on a non-default port, enter the port number that is used for [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] connections in the **Server port** box. For the default instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the default port number is 1433. For named instances, SSMA tries to obtain the port number from the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser Service.

1. In the **Authentication** dropdown list menu, select the authentication type to use for the connection. To use the current Windows account, select **Windows Authentication**. To use a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login, select **SQL Server Authentication**, and then provide a user name and password.

For more information about connecting to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Connecting to SQL Server (AccessToSQL)](../../ssma/access/connecting-to-sql-server-accesstosql.md).

#### Export inventory information

1. In Access Metadata Explorer, expand **Access-metabase**.

1. Select the check box next to **Databases**.

    To omit individual databases or database objects, expand the **Databases** folder, and then clear the check box next to the database or database object.

1. Right-click **Databases** and select **Export Schema**.

1. In the **Select Schema for Export** dialog box, select the target schema for the exported metadata, and then select **OK**.

Each time you export metadata, SSMA appends the data to the inventory. Existing data in the inventory isn't updated or deleted.

## Query the exported metadata

After you export metadata about Access databases, you can query the metadata. The following instructions describe to use the Query Editor window in [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to run queries.

#### Query metadata

1. From the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005** or to **Microsoft [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2008** or to **Microsoft [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2012**, and then select **SQL Server Management Studio**.

1. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, verify the settings, and then select **Connect**.

1. On the Management Studio toolbar, select **New Query** to open Query Editor.

1. In the Query Editor window, enter a query. Some examples are shown in the following section.

1. Press the F5 key to run the query.

## Query examples

Before you run any of the following queries, you should run a USE *database_name* query to make sure the queries are run against the database that contains the exported metadata. For example, if you exported metadata to a database named MyAccessMetadata, you would add the following statement at the beginning of the [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] code:

```sql
USE MyAccessMetadata;
GO
```

The following examples all use the **dbo** schema. If you exported the metadata to another schema, make sure to change the schema when you run these queries.

### What tables and columns are in these databases?

The following query joins the tables that contain column, table, and database metadata, and then returns the names of all databases, tables, and columns, sorted by column name:

```sql
SELECT DatabaseName,
    TableName,
    ColumnName
FROM dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryColumns C
INNER JOIN dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryTables T
    ON C.TableId = T.TableId
INNER JOIN dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryDatabases D
    ON T.DatabaseId = D.DatabaseId
ORDER BY ColumnName;
```

### What are the largest databases?

The following query returns the database name, file size, and number of tables in each Access database, sorted by file size:

```sql
SELECT DatabaseName,
    FileSize,
    TablesCount
FROM dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryDatabases
ORDER BY FileSize DESC;
```

### Who is the owner of most of the databases?

The following query returns the database name and owner of each Access database, sorted by owner.

```sql
SELECT DatabaseName, FileOwner
FROM dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryDatabases
ORDER BY FileOwner;
```

### Which databases contain the same tables?

The following query uses a subquery to find all table names that appear more than once in the list of tables, and then uses this list of tables to get the database name. The results are returned as the database name and then the table name, and are sorted by table name.

```sql
SELECT DatabaseName,
    TableName
FROM dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryTables T
INNER JOIN dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryDatabases D
    ON D.DatabaseId = T.DatabaseId
WHERE TableName IN (
    SELECT TableName
    FROM dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryTables
    GROUP BY TableName
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
ORDER BY TableName;
```

### Which databases weren't modified in the last six months?

The following query gets the current date, gets the month value for six months ago, and then returns a list of databases with a modified date of greater than six months ago.

```sql
SELECT DatabaseName,
    DateModified
FROM dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryDatabases
WHERE DATEDIFF(MONTH, DateModified, GETDATE()) > 6
ORDER BY DateModified;
```

### Which databases contain private information?

Your Access databases might contain sensitive or personal information. You might want to move these databases to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to take advantage of its security features. If you know that columns containing sensitive data have a specific name, or contain specific characters, you can use a query to find all columns that contain that information. For example, you can find all columns that include the string "salary".  The query then returns the database name, table name, and column name.

```sql
SELECT DatabaseName,
    TableName,
    ColumnName
FROM dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryColumns C
INNER JOIN dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryTables T
    ON C.TableId = T.TableId
INNER JOIN dbo.SSMA_Access_InventoryDatabases D
    ON T.DatabaseId = D.DatabaseId
WHERE ColumnName LIKE '%salary%';
```

If you don't know the column name, you can write a query to return all columns. To do this, remove the WHERE clause from the previous query.
