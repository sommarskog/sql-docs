# Status Option (Distributed Replay Administration Tool)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016-2019-only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-2019-only.md)]

[!INCLUDE [distributed-replay-sql-server-2022](../../includes/distributed-replay-sql-server-2022.md)]

The Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay administration tool, **DReplay.exe**, is a command-line tool that you can use to communicate with the distributed replay controller. This topic describes the **status** command-line option and corresponding syntax.

The **status** option queries the controller and displays the current status.

:::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: For more information about the syntax conventions that are used with the administration tool syntax, see [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md).

## Syntax

```dos

dreplay status [-m controller] [-f status_interval]  
```

### Parameters

**-m** _controller_  
Specifies the computer name of the controller. You can use "`localhost`" or "`.`" to refer to the local computer.

If the **-m** parameter isn't specified, the local computer is used.

**-f** _status_interval_  
Specifies the frequency (in seconds) at which to display the status.

If the **-f** parameter isn't specified, the default interval is 30 seconds.

## Examples

In the following example, the current status is displayed every 60 seconds. The value `localhost` indicates that the controller service is running on the same computer as the administration tool.

```dos
dreplay status -m localhost -f 60  
```

## Permissions

You must run the administration tool as an interactive user, as either a local user or a domain user account. To use a local user account, the administration tool and controller must be running on the same computer.
