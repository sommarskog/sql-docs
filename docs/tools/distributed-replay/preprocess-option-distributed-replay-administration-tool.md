# Preprocess Option (Distributed Replay Administration Tool)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016-2019-only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-2019-only.md)]

[!INCLUDE [distributed-replay-sql-server-2022](../../includes/distributed-replay-sql-server-2022.md)]

The Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Distributed Replay administration tool, **DReplay.exe**, is a command-line tool that you can use to communicate with the distributed replay controller. This topic describes the **preprocess** command-line option and corresponding syntax.

The **preprocess** option initiates the preprocess stage. During this stage, the controller prepares the input trace data for replay against the target server.

:::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: For more information about the syntax conventions that are used with the administration tool syntax, see [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md).

## Syntax

```dos

dreplay preprocess [-m controller] -i input_trace_file  
    -d controller_working_dir [-c config_file] [-f status_interval]  
```

### Parameters

**-m** _controller_  
Specifies the computer name of the controller. You can use "`localhost`" or "`.`" to refer to the local computer.

If the **-m** parameter isn't specified, the local computer is used.

**-i** _input_trace_file_  
Specifies the full path of the input trace file on the controller, such as `D:\Mytrace.trc`. The **-i** parameter is required.

If there are rollover files in the same directory, they'll be loaded and used automatically. The files must follow the file rollover naming convention, for example: `Mytrace.trc`, `Mytrace_1.trc`, `Mytrace_2.trc`, `Mytrace_3.trc`, ... `Mytrace_n.trc`.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using the administration tool on a different computer than the controller, you will need to copy the input trace files to the controller so that a local path can be used for this parameter.

**-d** _controller_working_dir_  
Specifies the directory on the controller where the intermediate file will be stored. The **-d** parameter is required.

The following requirements apply:

- The directory must reside on the controller.

- You must specify the full path, starting with a drive letter (for example, `c:\WorkingDir`).

- The path must not end with a backslash "`\`".

- UNC paths aren't supported.

**-c** _config_file_  
Is the full path of the preprocess configuration file; used to specify the location of the preprocess configuration file when stored in a different location. This parameter can be a UNC path, or can reside locally on the computer where you run the administration tool.

The **-c** parameter isn't required if no filtering is needed, or if you don't want to modify the maximum idle time.

Without the **-c** parameter, the default preprocess configuration file, `DReplay.exe.preprocess.config`, is used.

**-f** _status_interval_  
Specifies the frequency (in seconds) at which to display status messages.

If **-f** isn't specified, the default interval is 30 seconds.

## Examples

In this example, the preprocess stage is initiated with all of the default settings. The value `localhost` indicates that the controller service is running on the same computer as the administration tool. The *input_trace_file* parameter specifies the location of the input trace data, `c:\mytrace.trc`. Because there's no trace file filtering involved, the **-c** parameter does have to be specified.

```dos
dreplay preprocess -m localhost -i c:\mytrace.trc -d c:\WorkingDir  
```

In this example, the preprocess stage is initiated and a modified preprocess configuration file is specified. Unlike the previous example, the **-c** parameter is used to point to the modified configuration file, if you've stored it in a different location. For example:

```dos
dreplay preprocess -m localhost -i c:\mytrace.trc -d c:\WorkingDir -c c:\DReplay.exe.preprocess.config  
```

In the modified preprocess configuration file, a filter condition is added that filters out system sessions during distributed replay. The filter is added by modifying the `<PreprocessModifiers>` element in the preprocess configuration file, `DReplay.exe.preprocess.config`.

The following shows an example of the modified configuration file:

```xml
<?xml version='1.0'?> 
<Options> 
    <PreprocessModifiers> 
        <IncSystemSession>No</IncSystemSession> 
        <MaxIdleTime>-1</MaxIdleTime> 
    </PreprocessModifiers> 
</Options> 
```

## Permissions

You must run the administration tool as an interactive user, as either a local user or a domain user account. To use a local user account, the administration tool and controller must be running on the same computer.
