# Azure Synapse Pathway overview
[!INCLUDE [Azure Synapse Analytics](../../includes/applies-to-version/asa.md)]

As customers consider modernizing their data warehouse systems, one of the critical blockers they face is translating their SQL code. The existing code is written and optimized for their current system but needs to be optimized for the new system they're migrating to.

Organizations worldwide want to modernize their analytics platform to enjoy both total cost of ownership (TCO) and innovation benefits. However, customers have invested thousands of working hours, millions of dollars, and written tens of thousands of lines of code for their data warehouse.
 
To translate this critical SQL code, customers have to either manually rewrite existing SQL code or invest large amounts of their budget for an outside practice to rewrite or convert their code.
