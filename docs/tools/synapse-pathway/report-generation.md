# Report Generation for Azure Synapse Pathway
[!INCLUDE [Azure Synapse Analytics](../../includes/applies-to-version/asa.md)]

Azure Synapse Pathway provides a comprehensive report of the number of scripts that were successfully translated. The report also shows the number of errors and warnings on statements that didn't get translated.

## Generate Report

When you select **Translate**, you're presented with a report like below:

The migration savings are calculated based on the number  and complexity, simple, high, or medium, of objects translated. Synapse Pathway assumes 30 mins of manual effort for each object translation.
