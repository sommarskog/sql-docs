# SQL Server Browser Properties (Advanced Tab)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]
  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser program runs as a service on the server. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser listens for incoming requests for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resources and provides information about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instances installed on the computer.  
  
## Options  
 **Clustered**  
 Indicates if this service is installed as a resource of a clustered server.  
  
 **Customer Feedback Reporting**  
 Indicates whether Service Quality Monitoring has been enabled on this service. For more information on Customer Feedback Reporting, search Books Online for the topic, "Error and Usage Report Settings."  
  
 **Dump Directory**  
 The location where memory dumps are placed in case of an error.  
  
 **Error Reporting**  
 When set to **Yes**, the Dr. Watson program forwards information to either [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] or your error server if a serious failure occurs. For more information on Error Reporting, search Books Online for the topic, "Error and Usage Report Settings."  
  
 **Instance ID**  
 Indicates the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance that used this [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent instance. The default instance is **MSSQL10_50.MSSQLSERVER**.
