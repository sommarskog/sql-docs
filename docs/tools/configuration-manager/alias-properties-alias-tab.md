# &lt;Alias&gt; Properties (Alias Tab)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]

An alias is an alternate name that can be used to make a connection. The alias encapsulates the required elements of a connection string, and exposes them with a name chosen by the user. Use the **Alias** page on the **\<**Alias name**> Properties** dialog box to view or specify the elements of connection string of an Alias.

## Options

**Alias Name**

The name (alias) that you want to use to refer to this connection.  

**Pipe Name** / **Port No**  

Additional elements of the connection string. The name of this box varies with the selected protocol. See the topics listed below for examples.  

**Protocol**

The protocol used for the connection.

**Server**

The name of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance being connected to.
