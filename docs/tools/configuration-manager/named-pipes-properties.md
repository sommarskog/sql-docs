# Named Pipes Properties
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]
  Use the **Protocol**page on the **Named Pipes Properties** dialog box to view or change the named pipe that [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] listens to, when using the Named Pipes protocol.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] must be restarted to enable or disable the protocol, or change the named pipe.  
  
## Options  
 **Enabled**  
 Possible values are **Yes** and **No**.  
  
 **Pipe Name**  
 Specifies the named pipe on which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] listens. By default, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] listens on: `\\.\pipe\sql\query` for the default instance and `\\.\pipe\MSSQL$<instancename>\sql\query` for a named instance. This field is limited to 2047 characters.  
  
## Creating an Alternate Named Pipe  
 To change the named pipe, type the new pipe name in the **Pipe Name** box and then stop and restart [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Since **sql\query** is well known as the named pipe used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], changing the pipe can help reduce the risk of attack by malicious programs.  
  
### Example  
 Type **\\\\.\pipe\unit\app** to listen on the **unit\app** pipe.  
  
 Type **\\\\.\pipe\acct** to listen on the **acct** pipe.
