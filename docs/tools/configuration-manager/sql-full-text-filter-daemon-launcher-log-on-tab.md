# SQL Full-text Filter Daemon Launcher (Log On Tab)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]
  Beginning in [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)], the SQL Full-text Filter Daemon Launcher (FDHOST Launcher) service is used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] full-text search. This service must be running if you use full-text search. For information about the filter daemon host processes, see "Full-Text Search Architecture" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.  
  
 Use the **Log On** tab of the **SQL Full-text Filter Daemon Launcher  Properties** dialog box to specify the account used by the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] full-text service, to change the password of an account, and to start and stop the service. Changing the password of an account takes affect after restarting the service.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When changing the account name used by a service on a clustered instance, either the new account must be a member of the domain group specified during setup for the service, or you must have permission to add members to that group. If you do not have permission to modify group membership, contact the domain administrator.  
>   
>  For more information about selecting an account to run the service, see "Setting Up Windows Service Accounts" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.  
  
## Options
