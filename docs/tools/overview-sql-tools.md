# SQL tools overview

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

To manage your database, you need a tool. Whether your databases run in the cloud, on Windows, on macOS, or on [Linux](../linux/sql-server-linux-overview.md), your tool doesn't need to run on the same platform as the database.

You can view the links to the different SQL tools in the following tables.

> [!Note]
> To download SQL Server, see [Install SQL Server](../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server.md).
