# Save Trace Results to a Table (SQL Server Profiler)

 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

This topic describes how to save trace results to a database table by using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)].  
  
## To save trace results to a table
  
1.  On the **File** menu, click **New Trace**, and then connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
     The **Trace Properties**dialog box appears.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If **Start tracing immediately after making connection**is selected, the **Trace Properties**dialog box fails to appear and the trace begins instead. To turn off this setting, on the **Tools**menu, click **Options**, and clear the **Start tracing immediately after making connection** check box.  
  
2.  In the **Trace name** box, type a name for the trace, and then click **Save to table**.  
  
3.  In the **Connect to server** dialog box, connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database that will contain the trace table.  
  
4.  In the **Destination Table** dialog box, select a database from the **Database**list.  
  
5.  In the **Owner** list, select the owner for the trace.  
  
6.  In the **Table** list, type or select the table name for the trace results. Click **OK.**  
  
7.  In the **Trace Properties** dialog box, select the **Set maximum rows (in thousands)** check box to specify the maximum number of rows to save.
