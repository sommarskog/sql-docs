# Extract a Script from a Trace (SQL Server Profiler)

 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

This topic describes how to extract [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] events from a trace file or table and save them as a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] script file by using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)].  
  
### To extract a Transact-SQL script from a trace file or table  
  
1.  Open a trace file or table that contains [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] events that you want to save to a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] script file. For more information, see [Open a Trace File &#40;SQL Server Profiler&#41;](../../tools/sql-server-profiler/open-a-trace-file-sql-server-profiler.md) or [Open a Trace Table &#40;SQL Server Profiler&#41;](../../tools/sql-server-profiler/open-a-trace-table-sql-server-profiler.md).  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, point to **Export**, point to **Extract SQL Server Events**, and then click **Extract Transact-SQL Events**.  
  
3.  In the **Save As** dialog box, type a name for the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] file, and click **Save**.
