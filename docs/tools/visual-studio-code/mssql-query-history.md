# Query history in the mssql extension

This article introduces the functionality of query history in the mssql extension for VS Code. Query history is displayed as a section in the SQL Server view, which is available in the side bar by default when the [mssql extension for VS Code](mssql-extensions.md) is installed.

## View query history

Initially the query history view will be empty but once you execute a query it will be captured and displayed in the window - with a separate row displayed for every execution.

Each row consists of three parts:
- **Status icon**: The status icon will be a "✔️" if the query executed successfully or an "❌" if an error occurred.
- **Query Text**: The text of the query that was executed
- **Connection Info**: The server and database the query was executed against

## Query history row actions

Right-clicking on a history row will bring up a menu with the following actions available:

- Open Query
- Run Query
- Delete

### Open query

The **Open query** option opens a new query editor window populated with the query text from the query executed, using the connection of that query.

### Run query

The **Run query** option does the same thing as **Open query** but will additionally run the statement immediately.

### Delete

The **Delete** option permanently deletes the selected history row.

## Query history management

Query history capture can be managed with the ability to clear all the history or dynamically pause/start history capture.

### Data storage

Currently all information is stored in memory and not persisted upon application exit.  Query history from a session isn't available in a new VS Code window.

### Clear all history

The action to clear all query history is also available from the command palette (**MS SQL: Clear All History**) and as an action button on the view. This action permanently deletes **ALL** history rows.

### Pause/start query history capture

The ability to pause and start query history capture is available from the command palette (**MS SQL: Toggle Query History Capture**) and as an action button on the panel. While paused, no query execution data will be stored by query history.
