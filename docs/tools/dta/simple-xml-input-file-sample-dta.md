# Simple XML Input File Sample (DTA)

 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Copy and paste this sample of a simple XML input file to use for tuning workloads into your favorite XML editor or text editor. Then replace the values specified for the **Server**, **Database**, **Schema**, **Table**, **Workload**, and **TuningOptions** elements with those for your specific tuning session. For more information about the attributes and child elements that you can use with these elements, see the [XML Input File Reference &#40;Database Engine Tuning Advisor&#41;](../../tools/dta/xml-input-file-reference-database-engine-tuning-advisor.md). The following sample uses only a subset of available attribute and child element options.
