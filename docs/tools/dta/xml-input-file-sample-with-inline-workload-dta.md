# XML Input File Sample with Inline Workload (DTA)

 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Copy and paste this sample of an XML input file that specifies a workload with the **EventString** element into your favorite XML editor or text editor. You can use the **EventString** element to specify a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] script workload in the XML input file instead of using a separate workload file. After copying this sample into your editing tool, replace the values specified for the **Server**, **Database**, **Schema**, **Table**, **Workload**, **EventString**, and **TuningOptions** elements with those for your specific tuning session. For more information about all of the attributes and child elements that you can use with these elements, see the [XML Input File Reference &#40;Database Engine Tuning Advisor&#41;](../../tools/dta/xml-input-file-reference-database-engine-tuning-advisor.md). The following sample uses only a subset of available attribute and child element options.

## Code

[!code-xml[InputFileSamples#InlineWorkloadInputFile](../../tools/dta/codesnippet/xml/xml-input-file-sample-wi_1.xml)]

## Comments

`USE database_name` statements can be specified in the inline workload that is contained in the **EventString** element.
