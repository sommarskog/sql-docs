# XML Input File Samples (DTA)

 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This section contains sample XML input files that you can use with the **dta** command line tool. This tool is one of the user interfaces to the Database Engine Tuning Advisor, a tool you can use to tune databases for improved query performance. Database Engine Tuning Advisor analyzes the effects of a workload against a database or multiple databases. A workload is a set of [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that execute against databases that you want to tune. After Database Engine Tuning Advisor finishes analyzing the effects of the workload, it creates a recommendation for adding indexes, indexed views, or partitioning strategies that will improve query performance on your databases.
