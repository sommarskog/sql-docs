# Issue Element (ssbdiagnose)

 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Reports an issue that was found by the **ssbdiagnose** utility. The **ssbdiagnose** XML output file has one Issue element per issue reported.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
<Issue  
    type="..."   
    code="..."   
    server="..."   
    database="..."   
    object="...">   
    ...   
</Issue>  
```

Correct the problem and rerun **ssbdiagnose**.<br /><br /> **"Event"** Reports a [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] event found when you run a **-RUNTIME** check. Events are only reported if **-SHOWEVENTS** is specified.|  
|**code**|Identifies the error number for the message.|  
|**server**|Identifies the instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] in which the problem was found. If the problem was in a default instance, the server attribute only has the computer name. If the problem was in a named instance, the server attribute is in the form ComputerName\InstanceName.|  
|**database**|Identifies the name of the database in which the problem was found.|  
|**object**|Identifies the name of the object in which the problem was found. If the problem was an instance or database level issue, the object attribute repeats the instance or database name.|
