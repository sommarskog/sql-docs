# Managing CLR Integration Assemblies
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  Managed code is compiled and then deployed in units called an assembly. An assembly is packaged as a DLL or executable (.exe) file. While an executable file can run on its own, a DLL must be hosted in an existing application. Managed DLL assemblies can be loaded into and hosted by [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] requires you to register the assembly in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database using the CREATE ASSEMBLY statement, before it can be loaded in the process and used. Assemblies can also be updated from a more recent version using the ALTER ASSEMBLY statement, or removed from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using the DROP ASSEMBLY statement.  
  
 Assembly information is stored in the **sys.assembly_files** table in the database where the assembly has been installed. The **sys.assembly_files** table contains the following columns.  
  
|Column|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|assembly_id|The identifier defined for the assembly. This number is assigned to all objects relating to the same assembly.|  
|name|The name of the object.|  
|file_id|A number identifying each object, with the first object associated with a given **assembly_id** being given the value of 1. If multiple objects are associated with the same **assembly_id**, then each subsequent **file_id** value is incremented by 1.|  
|content|The hexadecimal representation of the assembly or file.|
