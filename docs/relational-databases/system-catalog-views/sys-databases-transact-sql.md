# sys.databases (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Contains one row per database in the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

If a database isn't `ONLINE`, or `AUTO_CLOSE` is set to `ON` and the database is closed, the values of some columns may be `NULL`. If a database is `OFFLINE`, the corresponding row isn't visible to low-privileged users. To see the corresponding row if the database is `OFFLINE`, a user must have at least the `ALTER ANY DATABASE` server-level permission, or the `CREATE DATABASE` permission in the `master` database.

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **name** | **sysname** | Name of database, unique within an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or within a [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] logical server. |

## Permissions

 If the caller of `sys.databases` isn't the owner of the database and the database isn't `master` or `tempdb`, the minimum permissions required to see the corresponding row are `ALTER ANY DATABASE` or the `VIEW ANY DATABASE` server-level permission, or `CREATE DATABASE` permission in the `master` database. The database to which the caller is connected can always be viewed in `sys.databases`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> By default, the public role has the `VIEW ANY DATABASE` permission, allowing all logins to see database information. To block a login from the ability to detect a database, `REVOKE` the `VIEW ANY DATABASE` permission from `public`, or `DENY` the `VIEW ANY DATABASE` permission for individual logins.

## Azure SQL Database Remarks

In [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] this view is available in the `master` database and in user databases. In the `master` database, this view returns the information on the `master` database and all user databases on the server. In a user database, this view returns information only on the current database and the `master` database.

 Use the `sys.databases` view in the `master` database of the [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] server where the new database is being created. After the database copy starts, you can query the `sys.databases` and `sys.dm_database_copies` views from the `master` database of the destination server to retrieve more information about the copying progress.

## Examples

### A. Query the `sys.databases` view

The following example returns a few of the columns available in the `sys.databases` view.

```sql
SELECT name, user_access_desc, is_read_only, state_desc, recovery_model_desc
FROM sys.databases;
```

### B. Check the copying status in [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../includes/sssds-md.md)]

The following example queries the `sys.databases` and `sys.dm_database_copies` views to return information about a database copy operation.

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]

```sql
-- Execute from the master database.
SELECT a.name, a.state_desc, b.start_date, b.modify_date, b.percent_complete
FROM sys.databases AS a
INNER JOIN sys.dm_database_copies AS b ON a.database_id = b.database_id
WHERE a.state = 7;
```

### C. Check the temporal retention policy status in [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../includes/sssds-md.md)]

The following example queries the `sys.databases` to return information whether temporal retention cleanup task is enabled. After the restore operation, temporal retention is disabled by default. Use `ALTER DATABASE` to enable it explicitly.

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]

```sql
-- Execute from the master database.
SELECT a.name, a.is_temporal_history_retention_enabled
FROM sys.databases AS a;
```
