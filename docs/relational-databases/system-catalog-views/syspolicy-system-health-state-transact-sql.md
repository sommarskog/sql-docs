# syspolicy_system_health_state (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  Displays one row for each Policy-Based Management policy and target query expression combination. Use the syspolicy_system_health_state view to programmatically check the policy health of the server. The following table describes the columns in the syspolicy_system_health_state view.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|health_state_id|**bigint**|Identifier of the policy health state record.|  
|policy_id|**int**|Identifier of the policy.|  
|last_run_date|**datetime**|Date and time the policy was last run.|  
|target_query_expression_with_id|**nvarchar(400)**|The target expression, with values assigned to identity variables, that defines the target against which the policy is evaluated.|  
|target_query_expression|**nvarchar(max)**|The epxression that defines the target against which the policy is evaluated.|  
|result|**bit**|Health state of this target with regard to the policy:<br /><br /> 0 = Failure<br /><br /> 1 = Success|  
  
## Remarks  
 The syspolicy_system_health_state view displays the most recent health state of target query expression for each active (enabled) policy. The [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Object Explorer and Object Explorer Details page aggregates policy health from this view to show the critical health state.
