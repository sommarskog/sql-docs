# sys.triggers (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Contains a row for each object that is a trigger, with a type of TR or TA. DML trigger names are schema-scoped and, therefore, are visible in **sys.objects**. DDL trigger names are scoped by the parent entity and are only visible in this view.  
  
 The **parent_class** and **name** columns uniquely identify the trigger in the database.
