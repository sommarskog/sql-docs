# sys.query_store_runtime_stats (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi-asa](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi-asa.md)]

  Contains information about the runtime execution statistics information for the query.

|Column name|Data type|Description|
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
|**runtime_stats_id**|**bigint**|Identifier of the row that represents runtime execution statistics for the **plan_id**, **execution_type** and **runtime_stats_interval_id**. It is unique only for the past runtime statistics intervals. For currently active interval, there may be multiple rows representing runtime statistics for the plan referenced by **plan_id**, with the execution type represented by **execution_type**. Typically, one row represents runtime statistics that are flushed to disk, while other(s) represent in-memory state. Hence, to get actual state for every interval you need to aggregate metrics, grouping by **plan_id**, **execution_type** and **runtime_stats_interval_id**.<br/>**Note:** [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] will always return zero (0).|

## Permissions

Requires the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission.

## Remarks

In rare situations, you might notice the DOP columns (max_dop, min_dop, avg_dop and last_dop) report large numbers. This might happen when queries execute on systems with large number of processors. You might notice this discrepancy in scenarios where the query uses user defined functions. The engineering team is investigating this issue and will update this note when this issue is fixed. This is a reporting issue in the statistics gathered for this catalog view and does not impact the actual query execution or its runtime performance.
