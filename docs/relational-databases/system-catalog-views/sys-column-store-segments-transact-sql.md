# sys.column_store_segments (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2012 Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2012-asdbmi.md)]

Returns one row for each column segment in a columnstore index. There is one column segment per column per rowgroup. For example, a table with 10 rowgroups and 34 columns returns 340 rows.

|Column name|Data type|Description|
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
|**partition_id**|**bigint**|Indicates the partition ID. Is unique within a database.|
|**hobt_id**|**bigint**|ID of the heap or B-tree index (HoBT) for the table that has this columnstore index.|
|**column_id**|**int**|ID of the columnstore column.|
|**segment_id**|**int**|ID of the rowgroup. For backward compatibility, the column name continues to be called segment_id even though this is the rowgroup ID. You can uniquely identify a segment using \<hobt_id, partition_id, column_id>, <segment_id>.|
|**version**|**int**|Version of the column segment format.|
|**encoding_type**|**int**|Type of encoding used for that segment:<br /><br />1 = VALUE_BASED - non-string/binary with no dictionary (similar to 4 with some internal variations)<br /><br />2 = VALUE_HASH_BASED - non-string/binary column with common values in dictionary<br /><br />3 = STRING_HASH_BASED - string/binary column with common values in dictionary<br /><br />4 = STORE_BY_VALUE_BASED - non-string/binary with no dictionary<br /><br />5 = STRING_STORE_BY_VALUE_BASED - string/binary with no dictionary<br /><br />For more information, see the [Remarks](#remarks) section.|
|**row_count**|**int**|Number of rows in the row group.|
|**has_nulls**|**int**|1 if the column segment has null values.|
|**base_id**|**bigint**|Base value ID if encoding type 1 is being used. If encoding type 1 is not being used, base_id is set to -1.|
|**magnitude**|**float**|Magnitude if encoding type 1 is being used. If encoding type 1 is not being used, magnitude is set to -1.|
|**primary_dictionary_id**|**int**|A value of 0 represents the global dictionary. A value of -1 indicates that there is no global dictionary created for this column.|
|**secondary_dictionary_id**|**int**|A non-zero value points to the local dictionary for this column in the current segment (for example, the rowgroup). A value of -1 indicates that there is no local dictionary for this segment.|
|**min_data_id**|**bigint**|Minimum data ID in the column segment.|
|**max_data_id**|**bigint**|Maximum data ID in the column segment.|
|**null_value**|**bigint**|Value used to represent nulls.|
|**on_disk_size**|**bigint**|Size of segment in bytes.|
|**collation_id**|**int** |**Applies to [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)]** and later.<br />Current collation when the segment was created. Maps to an internal ID. **Currently internal only and not for development.** |
|**min_deep_data**|**varbinary(18)**| **Applies to [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)]** and later.<br />Used for segment elimination.<sup>1</sup> For internal use only. |
|**max_deep_data** |**varbinary(18)**| **Applies to [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)]**  and later.<br />Used for segment elimination.<sup>1</sup> For internal use only. |

<sup>1</sup> After upgrading to a version of SQL Server that supports string min/max segment elimination ([!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] and later), `min_deep_data` and `max_deep_data` will be `NULL` until after the columnstore index is rebuilt, using a REBUILD or DROP/CREATE. After a rebuild, the segments that contain data types that can benefit from string min/max segment elimination will contain data.

## Remarks

The columnstore segment encoding type is selected by the [!INCLUDE[ssDE-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] with the goal of achieving the lowest storage cost, by analyzing the segment data. If data is mostly distinct, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] uses value-based encoding. If data is mostly not distinct, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] uses hash-based encoding. The choice between string-based and value-based encoding is related to the type of data being stored, whether string data or binary data. All encodings take advantage of bit-packing and run-length encoding when possible.

Columnstore segment elimination applies to numeric, date, and time data types, and the datetimeoffset data type with scale less than or equal to two. Beginning in [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)], segment elimination capabilities extend to string, binary, guid data types, and the datetimeoffset data type for scale greater than two. Segment elimination does not apply to LOB data types such as the (max) data type lengths.

## Permissions

 All columns require at least `VIEW DEFINITION` permission on the table. The following columns return `NULL` unless the user also has `SELECT` permission: `has_nulls`, `base_id`, `magnitude`, `min_data_id`, `max_data_id`, and `null_value`.

[!INCLUDE[ssCatViewPerm](../../includes/sscatviewperm-md.md)] For more information, see [Metadata Visibility Configuration](../../relational-databases/security/metadata-visibility-configuration.md).

## Examples

The following query returns information about segments of a columnstore index.

```sql
SELECT i.name, p.object_id, p.index_id, i.type_desc,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_segments
FROM sys.column_store_segments AS s
INNER JOIN sys.partitions AS p
    ON s.hobt_id = p.hobt_id
INNER JOIN sys.indexes AS i
    ON p.object_id = i.object_id
WHERE i.type = 5 OR i.type = 6
GROUP BY i.name, p.object_id, p.index_id, i.type_desc ;
GO
```
