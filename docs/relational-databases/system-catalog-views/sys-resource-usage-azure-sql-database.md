 Provides hourly summary of resource usage data for user databases in the current server. Historical data is retained for 90 days.  
  
 For each user database, there is one row for every hour in continuous fashion. Even if the database was idle during that hour, there is one row, and the usage_in_seconds value for that database will be 0. Storage usage and SKU information are rolled up for the hour appropriately.  
  
|Columns|Data Type|Description|  
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|end_time|**datetime**|Time (UTC) in hour increments.|  
|database_name|**nvarchar**|Name of user database.|  
|sku|**nvarchar**|Name of the service tier. Possible values include: Basic, Standard, Premium, GeneralPurpose, BusinessCritical, Hyperscale. |  
|storage_in_megabytes|**decimal**|Maximum used storage size for the hour, including database data, indexes, stored procedures and metadata.|  
  
## Permissions  

Requires permission to access the **master** database on the [logical server](/azure/azure-sql/database/logical-servers) in Azure SQL Database.  

## Examples

The following query returns data from the past two days:

```sql
SELECT end_time, database_name, sku, storage_in_megabytes 
FROM sys.resource_usage
WHERE end_time > DATEADD(dd,-2,SYSDATETIME());
GO
```
