# sys.dm_exec_query_stats (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Returns aggregate performance statistics for cached query plans in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The view contains one row per query statement within the cached plan, and the lifetime of the rows are tied to the plan itself. When a plan is removed from the cache, the corresponding rows are eliminated from this view.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> - The results of **sys.dm_exec_query_stats**  may vary with each execution as the data only reflects finished queries, and not ones still in-flight.
> - To call this from dedicated SQL pool in [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)], use the name **sys.dm_pdw_nodes_exec_query_stats**. For serverless SQL pool use **sys.dm_exec_query_stats**.

## Permissions  

On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and SQL Managed Instance, requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission.

On SQL Database **Basic**, **S0**, and **S1** service objectives, and for databases in **elastic pools**, the [server admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/logins-create-manage#existing-logins-and-user-accounts-after-creating-a-new-database) account, the [Azure Active Directory admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview#administrator-structure) account, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` [server role](/azure/azure-sql/database/security-server-roles) is required. On all other SQL Database service objectives, either the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission on the database, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` server role is required.   
   
### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

Requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.

## Remarks  
 Statistics in the view are updated when a query is completed.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Finding the TOP N queries  
 The following example returns information about the top five queries ranked by average CPU time. This example aggregates the queries according to their query hash so that logically equivalent queries are grouped by their cumulative resource consumption. The Sample_Statement_Text column shows an example of the query structure that matches the query hash, but it should be read without regard to specific values in the statement. For example, if a statement contains `WHERE Id = 5`, you may read it in its more generic form: `WHERE Id = @some_value`
  
```sql  
SELECT TOP 5 query_stats.query_hash AS Query_Hash,   
    SUM(query_stats.total_worker_time) / SUM(query_stats.execution_count) AS Avg_CPU_Time,  
    MIN(query_stats.statement_text) AS Sample_Statement_Text
FROM   
    (SELECT QS.*,   
    SUBSTRING(ST.text, (QS.statement_start_offset/2) + 1,  
    ((CASE statement_end_offset   
        WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH(ST.text)  
        ELSE QS.statement_end_offset END   
            - QS.statement_start_offset)/2) + 1) AS statement_text  
     FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats AS QS  
     CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(QS.sql_handle) as ST) as query_stats  
GROUP BY query_stats.query_hash  
ORDER BY 2 DESC;  
```  
  
### B. Returning row count aggregates for a query  
 The following example returns row count aggregate information (total rows, minimum rows, maximum rows and last rows) for queries.  
  
```sql  
SELECT qs.execution_count,  
    SUBSTRING(qt.text,qs.statement_start_offset/2 +1,   
                 (CASE WHEN qs.statement_end_offset = -1   
                       THEN LEN(CONVERT(nvarchar(max), qt.text)) * 2   
                       ELSE qs.statement_end_offset end -  
                            qs.statement_start_offset  
                 )/2  
             ) AS query_text,   
     qt.dbid, dbname= DB_NAME (qt.dbid), qt.objectid,   
     qs.total_rows, qs.last_rows, qs.min_rows, qs.max_rows  
FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats AS qs   
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) AS qt   
WHERE qt.text like '%SELECT%'   
ORDER BY qs.execution_count DESC;  
```
