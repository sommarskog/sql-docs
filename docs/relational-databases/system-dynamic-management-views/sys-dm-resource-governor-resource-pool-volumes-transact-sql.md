# sys.dm_resource_governor_resource_pool_volumes (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[sqlserver](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  Returns information about the current resource pool IO statistics for each disk volume. This information is also available at the resource pool level in [sys.dm_resource_governor_resource_pools &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-resource-governor-resource-pools-transact-sql.md).
