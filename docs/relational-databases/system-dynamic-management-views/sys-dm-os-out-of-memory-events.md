# sys.dm_os_out_of_memory_events

[!INCLUDE[Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Returns a log of out of memory (OOM) events.

  For more information on out of memory conditions in [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)], see [Troubleshoot out of memory errors in Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/troubleshoot-memory-errors-issues).

## Permissions
On [!INCLUDE[ssazuremi_md](../../includes/ssazuremi_md.md)], requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission.

On SQL Database **Basic**, **S0**, and **S1** service objectives, and for databases in **elastic pools**, the [server admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/logins-create-manage#existing-logins-and-user-accounts-after-creating-a-new-database) account, the [Azure Active Directory admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview#administrator-structure) account, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` [server role](/azure/azure-sql/database/security-server-roles) is required. On all other SQL Database service objectives, either the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission on the database, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` server role is required.

### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

Requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.

## Remarks

Each row in this view represents an out of memory (OOM) event that has occurred in the database engine. Not all OOM events may be captured. Older OOM events may disappear from the result set as more recent OOM events occur. Result set is not persisted across restarts of the database engine.

## Example  
  
The following example returns event data ordered by the most recent time for the currently connected database.
  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_out_of_memory_events ORDER BY event_time DESC;  
```
