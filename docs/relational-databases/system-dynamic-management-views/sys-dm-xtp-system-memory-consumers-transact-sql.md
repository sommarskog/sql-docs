# sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Reports system level memory consumers for [!INCLUDE[inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)]. The memory for these consumers comes either from the default pool (when the allocation is in the context of a user thread) or from the internal pool (if the allocation is in the context of a system thread).

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers;
```

| Column name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| memory_consumer_id | **bigint** | Internal ID for memory consumer. |
| memory_consumer_type | **int** | An integer that represents the type of the memory consumer with one of the following values:<br /><br />0 - Should not be displayed. Aggregates memory usage of two or more consumers.<br /><br />1 - LOOKASIDE: Tracks memory consumption for a system lookaside.<br /><br />2 - VARHEAP: Tracks memory consumption for a variable-length heap.<br /><br />4 - IO page pool: Tracks memory consumption for a system page pool used for IO operations. |
| memory_consumer_type_desc | **nvarchar(16)** | The description of the type of memory consumer:<br /><br />0 - Should not be displayed<br /><br />1 - LOOKASIDE<br /><br />2 - VARHEAP<br /><br />4 - PGPOOL |
| memory_consumer_desc | **nvarchar(64)** | Description of the memory consumer instance:<br /><br />VARHEAP:<br />System heap. General purpose. Currently only used to allocate garbage collection work items.<br />-OR-<br />Lookaside heap. Used by lookasides when the number of items contained in the lookaside list reaches a predetermined cap (usually around 5,000 items).<br /><br />PGPOOL: For IO system pools there are three different sizes: System 4K page pool, System 64-K page pool, and System 256-K page pool. |
| lookaside_id | **bigint** | The ID of the thread-local, lookaside memory provider. |
| pagepool_id | **bigint** | The ID of the thread-local, page pool memory provider. |
| allocated_bytes | **bigint** | Number of bytes reserved for this consumer. |
| used_bytes | **bigint** | Bytes used by this consumer. Applies only to varheap memory consumers.<br /><br />Starting with [!INCLUDE [sqlserver2022](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)], applies to varheap and lookaside memory consumers. |
| allocation_count | **int** | Number of allocations.<br /><br />Starting with [!INCLUDE [sqlserver2022](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)], the number of allocations from the system heap for lookaside memory consumers. |
| partition_count | **int** | Internal use only. |
| sizeclass_count | **int** | Internal use only. |
| min_sizeclass | **int** | Internal use only. |
| max_sizeclass | **int** | Internal use only. |
| memory_consumer_address | **varbinary** | Internal address of the consumer. |

## Permissions

Requires VIEW SERVER STATE permissions on the server.

### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

Requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.

## Remarks

In [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)], this DMV has additional columns specific to memory-optimized `tempdb` metadata memory improvements.

## Example

This example outputs the system memory consumers for the SQL Server instance:

```sql
SELECT memory_consumer_type_desc,
       memory_consumer_desc,
       allocated_bytes / 1024 as allocated_bytes_kb,
       used_bytes / 1024 as used_bytes_kb,
       allocation_count
FROM sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers;
```

 The output shows all memory consumers at system level. For example, there are consumers for transaction look aside.

```output
memory_consumer_type_desc                memory_consumer_desc                           allocated_bytes_kb   used_bytes_kb        allocation_count

```

To see the total memory consumed by system allocators:

```sql
SELECT SUM(allocated_bytes) / (1024 * 1024) AS total_allocated_MB,
       SUM(used_bytes) / (1024 * 1024) AS total_used_MB
FROM sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers;
```

Here is the result set.

```output
total_allocated_MB   total_used_MB
-------------------- --------------------
2                    2
```
