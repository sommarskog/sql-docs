# sys.dm_exec_session_wait_stats (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Returns information about all the waits encountered by threads that executed for each session. You can use this  view to diagnose performance issues with the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] session and also with specific queries and batches. This view returns session the same information that is aggregated for [sys.dm_os_wait_stats (Transact-SQL)](sys-dm-os-wait-stats-transact-sql.md) but provides the **session_id** number as well.

**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and later versions.

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| session_id | **smallint** | The ID of the session. |
| wait_type | **nvarchar(60)** | Name of the wait type. For more information, see [sys.dm_os_wait_stats (Transact-SQL)](sys-dm-os-wait-stats-transact-sql.md). |
| waiting_tasks_count | **bigint** | Number of waits on this wait type. This counter is incremented at the start of each wait. |
| wait_time_ms | **bigint** | Total wait time for this wait type in milliseconds. This time is inclusive of `signal_wait_time_ms`. |
| max_wait_time_ms | **bigint** | Maximum wait time on this wait type. |
| signal_wait_time_ms | **bigint** | Difference between the time that the waiting thread was signaled and when it started running. |

## Remarks

This DMV resets the information for a session when the session is opened, or when the session is reset (if connection pooling),

For information about the wait types, see [sys.dm_os_wait_stats (Transact-SQL)](sys-dm-os-wait-stats-transact-sql.md).

## Permissions

For [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] and previous versions, if you have VIEW SERVER STATE permission on the server, you see all executing sessions on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]; otherwise, you see only the current session.

For [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] and later versions, you require VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.
