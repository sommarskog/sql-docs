# sys.dm_exec_sessions (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Returns one row per authenticated session on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. `sys.dm_exec_sessions` is a server-scope view that shows information about all active user connections and internal tasks. This information includes client version, client program name, client login time, login user, current session setting, and more. Use `sys.dm_exec_sessions` to first view the current system load and to identify a session of interest, and then learn more information about that session by using other dynamic management views or dynamic management functions.

The `sys.dm_exec_connections`, `sys.dm_exec_sessions`, and `sys.dm_exec_requests` dynamic management views map to the deprecated [sys.sysprocesses](../../relational-databases/system-compatibility-views/sys-sysprocesses-transact-sql.md) system compatibility view.

> [!NOTE]  
> To call this from dedicated SQL pool in [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)], see [sys.dm_pdw_nodes_exec_sessions](sys-dm-pdw-exec-sessions-transact-sql.md). For serverless SQL pool or [!INCLUDE[fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)] use `sys.dm_exec_sessions`.

## Permissions

Everyone can see their own session information.

**[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:** Requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to see all sessions on the server.  

**[!INCLUDE[ssSDS_md](../../includes/sssds-md.md)]:** Requires `VIEW DATABASE STATE` to see all connections to the current database. `VIEW DATABASE STATE` can't be granted in the `master` database.

### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

Requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.

## Remarks

When the **common criteria compliance enabled** server configuration option is enabled, logon statistics are displayed in the following columns.

- `last_successful_logon`
- `last_unsuccessful_logon`
- `unsuccessful_logons`

If this option isn't enabled, these columns will return null values. For more information about how to set this server configuration option, see [common criteria compliance enabled server configuration option](../../database-engine/configure-windows/common-criteria-compliance-enabled-server-configuration-option.md).

The admin connections on Azure SQL Database see one row per authenticated session. The "sa" sessions that appear in the resultset, don't have any effect on the user quota for sessions. The non-admin connections will only see information related to their database user sessions.

Because of differences in how they are recorded, `open_transaction_count` may not match `sys.dm_tran_session_transactions`.`open_transaction_count`.

| From | To | On/Apply | Relationship |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sys.dm_exec_sessions` | [sys.dm_exec_requests](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-requests-transact-sql.md) | session_id | One-to-zero or one-to-many |
| `sys.dm_exec_sessions` | [sys.dm_exec_connections](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-connections-transact-sql.md) | session_id | One-to-zero or one-to-many |
| `sys.dm_exec_sessions` | [sys.dm_tran_session_transactions](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-tran-session-transactions-transact-sql.md) | session_id | One-to-zero or one-to-many |
| `sys.dm_exec_sessions` | [sys.dm_exec_cursors](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-cursors-transact-sql.md) (session_id \| 0) | session_id CROSS APPLY<br /><br />OUTER APPLY | One-to-zero or one-to-many |

## Examples

### A. Find users that are connected to the server

The following example finds the users that are connected to the server and returns the number of sessions for each user.

```sql
SELECT login_name,
    COUNT(session_id) AS session_count
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
GROUP BY login_name;
```

### B. Find long-running cursors

The following example finds the cursors that have been open for more than a specific period of time, who created the cursors, and what session the cursors are on.

```sql
USE master;
GO

SELECT creation_time,
    cursor_id,
    name,
    c.session_id,
    login_name
FROM sys.dm_exec_cursors(0) AS c
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions AS s
    ON c.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE DATEDIFF(mi, c.creation_time, GETDATE()) > 5;
GO
```

### C. Find idle sessions that have open transactions

The following example finds sessions that have open transactions and are idle. An idle session is one that has no request currently running.

```sql
SELECT s.*
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions AS s
WHERE EXISTS (
        SELECT *
        FROM sys.dm_tran_session_transactions AS t
        WHERE t.session_id = s.session_id
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT *
        FROM sys.dm_exec_requests AS r
        WHERE r.session_id = s.session_id
    );
```

### D. Find information about a queries own connection

The following example gathers information about a query's own connection:

```sql
SELECT c.session_id,
    c.net_transport,
    c.encrypt_option,
    c.auth_scheme,
    s.host_name,
    s.program_name,
    s.client_interface_name,
    s.login_name,
    s.nt_domain,
    s.nt_user_name,
    s.original_login_name,
    c.connect_time,
    s.login_time
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections AS c
INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions AS s
    ON c.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE c.session_id = @@SPID;
```
