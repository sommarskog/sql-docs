# sys.dm_exec_query_statistics_xml (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Returns query execution plan for in-flight requests. Use this DMV to retrieve showplan XML with transient statistics. 

## Syntax

```
sys.dm_exec_query_statistics_xml(session_id)  
``` 

## Arguments 
*session_id*  
 Is the session id executing the batch to be looked up. *session_id* is **smallint**. *session_id* can be obtained from the following dynamic management objects:  
  
-   [sys.dm_exec_requests](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-requests-transact-sql.md)  
  
-   [sys.dm_exec_sessions](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-sessions-transact-sql.md)  
  
-   [sys.dm_exec_connections](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-connections-transact-sql.md)  

## Table Returned

|Column Name|Data Type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
|session_id|**smallint**|ID of the session. Not nullable.|
|request_id|**int**|ID of the request. Not nullable.|
|sql_handle|**varbinary(64)**|Is a token that uniquely identifies the batch or stored procedure that the query is part of. Nullable.|
|plan_handle|**varbinary(64)**|Is a token that uniquely identifies a query execution plan for a batch that is currently executing. Nullable.|
|query_plan|**xml**|Contains the runtime Showplan representation of the query execution plan that is specified with *plan_handle* containing partial statistics. The Showplan is in XML format. One plan is generated for each batch that contains, for example ad hoc [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements, stored procedure calls, and user-defined function calls. Nullable.|

## Remarks
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Owning to a possible random access violation (AV) while executing a monitoring stored procedure with the ``sys.dm_exec_query_statistics_xml`` DMV, the Showplan XML attribute \<ParameterList\> value `ParameterRuntimeValue` was removed in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] CU 26 and [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] CU 12. This value could be useful while troubleshooting long running stored procedures.
>
> Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] CU 31 and [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] CU 19, the collection of the Showplan XML attribute \<ParameterList\> value `ParameterRuntimeValue` has been re-enabled with the inclusion of trace flag 2446. This trace flag enables the collection of the runtime parameter value at the cost of introducing additional overhead.

> [!WARNING]
>Trace Flag 2446 isn't meant to be enabled continuously in a production environment, but only for time-limited troubleshooting purposes. Using this trace flag will introduce additional and possibly significant CPU and memory overhead as we will create a Showplan XML fragment with runtime parameter information, whether the ``sys.dm_exec_query_statistics_xml`` DMV is called or not.

> [!NOTE]
>Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL22](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[Azure SQL Database](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)], and [!INCLUDE[Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/ssazuremi_md.md)], to accomplish this at the database level see the FORCE_SHOWPLAN_RUNTIME_PARAMETER_COLLECTION option in [ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md).

This system function is available starting with [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] SP1. See KB [3190871](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3190871)

This system function works under both **standard** and **lightweight** query execution statistics profiling infrastructure. For more information, see [Query Profiling Infrastructure](../../relational-databases/performance/query-profiling-infrastructure.md).  

Under the following conditions, no Showplan output is returned in the **query_plan** column of the returned table for **sys.dm_exec_query_statistics_xml**:  
  
-   If the query plan that corresponds to the specified *session_id* is no longer executing, the **query_plan** column of the returned table is null. For example, this condition may occur if there is a time delay between when the plan handle was captured and when it was used with **sys.dm_exec_query_statistics_xml**.  
    
Due to a limitation in the number of nested levels allowed in the **xml** data type, **sys.dm_exec_query_statistics_xml** cannot return query plans that meet or exceed 128 levels of nested elements. In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], this condition prevented the query plan from returning and generates error 6335. In [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] Service Pack 2 and later versions, the **query_plan** column returns NULL.   

## Permissions  
On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission on the server.  
On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../includes/sssds-md.md)] Premium Tiers, requires the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission in the database. On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../includes/sssds-md.md)] Standard and Basic Tiers, requires the **Server admin** or an **Azure Active Directory admin** account.

### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

Requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.

## Examples  
  
### A. Looking at live query plan and execution statistics for a running batch  
 The following example queries **sys.dm_exec_requests** to find the interesting query and copy its `session_id` from the output.  
  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_requests;  
GO  
```  
  
 Then, to obtain the live query plan and execution statistics, use the copied `session_id` with system function **sys.dm_exec_query_statistics_xml**.  
  
```sql  
--Run this in a different session than the session in which your query is running.
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_query_statistics_xml(< copied session_id >);  
GO  
```   

 Or combined for all running requests.  
  
```sql  
--Run this in a different session than the session in which your query is running.
SELECT 
	eqs.query_plan, 
	er.session_id, 
	er.request_id, 
	er.database_id,
	er.start_time,
	er.[status], 
	er.wait_type,
	er.wait_resource, 
	er.last_wait_type,
	(er.cpu_time/1000) AS cpu_time_sec,
	(er.total_elapsed_time/1000)/60 AS elapsed_time_minutes,
	(er.logical_reads*8)/1024 AS logical_reads_KB,
	er.granted_query_memory,
	er.dop,
	er.row_count, 
	er.query_hash, 
	er.query_plan_hash
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests er
	CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_query_statistics_xml(session_id) eqs
WHERE er.session_id <> @@spid;
GO
```
