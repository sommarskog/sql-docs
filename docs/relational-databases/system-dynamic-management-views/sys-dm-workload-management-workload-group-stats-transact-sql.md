# sys.dm_workload_management_workload_groups_stats (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [asa](../../includes/applies-to-version/asa.md)]

Returns workload group statistics and the effective values of the workload group in [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)].

|Column Name|Data Type|Description|Range|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|  
|group_id|**int**|Unique ID of the workload group.||
|name|**sysname**|Name of the workload group.||
|statistics_start_time|**datetime**|Time that statistics collection began for the workload group.  The value  is either when the workload group was created or when instance is paused or scaled.||
|total_request_count|**bigint**|Cumulative count of completed requests in the workload group.||
|total_shared_resource_requests|**bigint**|Cumulative count of completed requests in the workload group that go beyond the reserved resources for the workload group and use resources from the shared pool. When the workload group does not have a MinResourcePercentage set, the requests will always be using shared resources and do not register in this count.||
|total_queued_request_count|**bigint**|Cumulative count of requests queued after the max_concurrency limit was reached.||
|total_request_execution_timeouts|**bigint**|Cumulative count of requests in the workload group that timed out before completion based on the query_execution_timeout_sec setting.||
|effective_min_percentage_resource|**tinyint**|The effective min_percentage_resource setting allowed considering the service level and the workload group settings. The effective min_percentage_resource can be adjusted higher on lower service levels.  For example, on DW100c, the lowest min_percentage_resource allowable is 25%.  The min_percentage_resource is adjusted to 0% if the value cannot be granted at the service level.  For example, min_percentage_resource set to 10% at DW6000c, would have an effective_min_percentage_resource of 0% when scaled down to DW100c.||
|effective_cap_percentage_resource|**tinyint**|The effective cap_percentage_resource for the workload group.  If there are other workload groups with min_percentage_resource > 0, the effective_cap_percentage_resource is lowered proportionally.||
|effective_request_min_resource_grant_percent|**decimal(5,2)**|The effective runtime value for request_min_resource_grant_percent of the workload group. The effective value considering the service level and how the workload group is configured.  If min_percentage_resource is adjusted because of the service level, effective_request_min_resource_grant_percent will be adjusted accordingly.||
|effective_request_max_resource_grant_percent|**decimal(5,2)**|The effective runtime value for request_max_resource_grant_percent of the workload group considering the configuration of the all workload groups.||
