# sys.dm_os_memory_objects (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  Returns memory objects that are currently allocated by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You can use **sys.dm_os_memory_objects** to analyze memory use and to identify possible memory leaks. 

> [!NOTE]  
>  To call this from [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)], use the name **sys.dm_pdw_nodes_os_memory_objects**. [!INCLUDE[synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax](../../includes/synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax.md)]

 **partition_type**, **contention_factor**, **waiting_tasks_count**, and **exclusive_access_count** are not yet implemented in [!INCLUDE[sqldbesa](../../includes/sqldbesa-md.md)].  
  
## Permissions

On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and SQL Managed Instance, requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission.

On SQL Database **Basic**, **S0**, and **S1** service objectives, and for databases in **elastic pools**, the [server admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/logins-create-manage#existing-logins-and-user-accounts-after-creating-a-new-database) account, the [Azure Active Directory admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview#administrator-structure) account, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` [server role](/azure/azure-sql/database/security-server-roles) is required. On all other SQL Database service objectives, either the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission on the database, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` server role is required.   

### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

Requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.

## Remarks  
 Memory objects are heaps. They provide allocations that have a finer granularity than those provided by memory clerks. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components use memory objects instead of memory clerks. Memory objects use the page allocator interface of the memory clerk to allocate pages. Memory objects do not use virtual or shared memory interfaces. Depending on the allocation patterns, components can create different types of memory objects to allocate regions of arbitrary size.  
  
 The typical page size for a memory object is 8 KB. However, incremental memory objects can have page sizes that range from 512 bytes to 8 KB.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Page size is not a maximum allocation. Instead, page size is allocation granularity that is supported by a page allocator and that is implemented by a memory clerk. You can request allocations greater than 8 KB from memory objects.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example returns the amount of memory allocated by each memory object type.  
  
```  
SELECT SUM (pages_in_bytes) as 'Bytes Used', type   
FROM sys.dm_os_memory_objects  
GROUP BY type   
ORDER BY 'Bytes Used' DESC;  
GO  
```
