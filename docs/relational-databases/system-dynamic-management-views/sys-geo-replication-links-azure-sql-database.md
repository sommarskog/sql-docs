# sys.geo_replication_links (Azure SQL Database)

[!INCLUDE[Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/asdb.md)]

Contains a row for each replication link between primary and secondary databases in a geo-replication partnership. This view resides in the logical **master** database.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|database_id|**int**|ID of the current database in the sys.databases view.|  
|start_date|**datetimeoffset**|UTC time at a regional SQL Database datacenter when the database replication was initiated.|  
|modify_date|**datetimeoffset**|UTC time at regional SQL Database datacenter when the database geo-replication has completed. The new database is synchronized with the primary database as of this time.|  
|link_guid|**uniqueidentifier**|Unique ID of the geo-replication link.|  
|partner_server|**sysname**|Name of the SQL Database server containing the geo-replicated database.|  
|partner_database|**sysname**|Name of the geo-replicated database on the linked SQL Database server.|  
|replication_state|**tinyint**|The state of geo-replication for this database, one of:<br /><br /> 0 = Pending. Creation of the active secondary database is scheduled but the necessary preparation steps are not yet completed.<br /><br />1 = Seeding. The geo-replication target is being seeded but the two databases are not yet synchronized. Until seeding completes, you cannot connect to the secondary database. Removing secondary database from the primary will cancel the seeding operation.<br /><br />2 = Catch-up. The secondary database is in a transactionally consistent state and is being constantly synchronized with the primary database.<br /><br />4 = Suspended. This is not an active continuous-copy relationship. This state usually indicates that the bandwidth available for the interlink is insufficient for the level of transaction activity on the primary database. However, the continuous-copy relationship is still intact.| 
|replication_state_desc|**nvarchar(256)**|PENDING<br /><br /> SEEDING<br /><br /> CATCH_UP<br /><br /> SUSPENDED| 
|role|**tinyint**|Geo-replication role, one of:<br /><br /> 0 = Primary. The database_id  refers to the primary database in the geo-replication partnership.<br /><br /> 1 = Secondary.  The database_id  refers to the primary database in the geo-replication partnership.|  
|role_desc|**nvarchar(256)**|PRIMARY<br /><br /> SECONDARY|  
|secondary_allow_connections|**tinyint**|The secondary type, one of:<br /><br /> 0 = No. The secondary database is not accessible until failover.<br /><br /> 1 = ReadOnly. The secondary database is accessible only to client connections with [ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly](/azure/azure-sql/database/read-scale-out#connect-to-a-read-only-replica).<br /><br /> 2 = All. The secondary database is accessible to any client connection.|  
|secondary_allow_connections_desc|**nvarchar(256)**|No<br /><br /> All<br /><br /> Read-Only|  
|percent_copied|**int**|Seeding progress in percent|

## Permissions

This view is only available in the **master** database on the [logical server](/azure/azure-sql/database/logical-servers) to the server-level principal login. Results will only be returned for the server administrator, Azure Active Directory admin, or for a user with the dbmanager role.
  
## Example

Show all databases with geo-replication links.  

```sql
SELECT
     database_id  
   , start_date  
   , partner_server  
   , partner_database  
   , replication_state  
   , role_desc  
   , secondary_allow_connections_desc
FROM sys.geo_replication_links;  
```
