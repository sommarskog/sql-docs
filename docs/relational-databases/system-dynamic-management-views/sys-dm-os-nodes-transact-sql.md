# sys.dm_os_nodes (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

An internal component named the SQLOS creates node structures that mimic hardware processor locality. These structures can be changed by using [soft-NUMA](../../database-engine/configure-windows/soft-numa-sql-server.md) to create custom node layouts.  

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] will automatically use soft-NUMA for certain hardware configurations. For more information, see [Automatic Soft-NUMA](../../database-engine/configure-windows/soft-numa-sql-server.md#automatic-soft-numa).
  
The following table provides information about these nodes.

|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|node_id|**smallint**|ID of the node.|  
|node_state_desc|**nvarchar(256)**|Description of the node state. Values are displayed with the mutually exclusive values first, followed by the combinable values. For example:<br /> Online, Thread Resources Low, Lazy Preemptive<br /><br />There are four mutually exclusive node_state_desc values. They are listed below with their descriptions.<br /><ul><li>ONLINE: Node is online<li>OFFLINE: Node is offline<li>IDLE: Node has no pending work requests, and has entered an idle state.<li>IDLE_READY: Node has no pending work requests, and is ready to enter an idle state.</li></ul><br />There are three combinable node_state_desc values, listed below with their descriptions.<br /><ul><li>DAC: This node is reserved for the [Dedicated Administrative Connection](../../database-engine/configure-windows/diagnostic-connection-for-database-administrators.md).<li>THREAD_RESOURCES_LOW: No new threads can be created on this node because of a low-memory condition.<li>HOT ADDED: Indicates the nodes were added in response to a hot add CPU event.</li></ul>|  
|memory_object_address|**varbinary(8)**|Address of memory object associated with this node. One-to-one relation to [sys.dm_os_memory_objects](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-memory-objects-transact-sql.md).memory_object_address.|

## Permissions

On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and SQL Managed Instance, requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission.

On SQL Database **Basic**, **S0**, and **S1** service objectives, and for databases in **elastic pools**, the [server admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/logins-create-manage#existing-logins-and-user-accounts-after-creating-a-new-database) account, the [Azure Active Directory admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview#administrator-structure) account, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` [server role](/azure/azure-sql/database/security-server-roles) is required. On all other SQL Database service objectives, either the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission on the database, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` server role is required.   

### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

Requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.
