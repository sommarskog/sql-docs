# sys.dm_pdw_hadoop_operations (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[applies-to-version/asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/asa-pdw.md)]

  Contains a row for each map-reduce job that is pushed down to Hadoop as part of running a [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] query on an external Hadoop table. Each map-reduce job represents one of the predicates in the query. This is only used when predicate pushdown is enabled for queries on Hadoop external tables.
