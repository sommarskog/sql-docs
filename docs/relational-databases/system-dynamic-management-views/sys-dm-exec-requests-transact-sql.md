# sys.dm_exec_requests (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw-fabricse-fabricdw.md)]

Returns information about each request that is executing in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information about requests, see the [Thread and Task Architecture Guide](../thread-and-task-architecture-guide.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To call this from dedicated SQL pool in [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)], see [sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests (Transact-SQL)](sys-dm-pdw-exec-requests-transact-sql.md). For serverless SQL pool or [!INCLUDE[fabric](../../includes/fabric.md)] use `sys.dm_exec_requests`.

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| session_id | **smallint** | ID of the session to which this request is related. Not nullable. |
| request_id | **int** | ID of the request. Unique in the context of the session. Not nullable. |
| start_time | **datetime** | Timestamp when the request arrived. Not nullable. |
| status | **nvarchar(30)** | Status of the request. Can be one of the following values:<br /><br />background<br />rollback<br />running<br />runnable<br />sleeping<br />suspended<br /><br />Not nullable. |
| command | **nvarchar(32)** | Identifies the current type of command that is being processed. Common command types include the following values:<br /><br />SELECT<br />INSERT<br />UPDATE<br />DELETE<br />BACKUP LOG<br />BACKUP DATABASE<br />DBCC<br />FOR<br /><br />The text of the request can be retrieved by using `sys.dm_exec_sql_text` with the corresponding sql_handle for the request. Internal system processes set the command based on the type of task they perform. Tasks can include the following values:<br /><br />LOCK MONITOR<br />CHECKPOINTLAZY<br />WRITER<br /><br />Not nullable. |
| sql_handle | **varbinary(64)** | Is a token that uniquely identifies the batch or stored procedure that the query is part of. Nullable. |
| statement_start_offset | **int** | Indicates, in bytes, beginning with 0, the starting position of the currently executing statement for the currently executing batch or persisted object. Can be used together with the `sql_handle`, the `statement_end_offset`, and the `sys.dm_exec_sql_text` dynamic management function to retrieve the currently executing statement for the request. Nullable. |
| statement_end_offset | **int** | Indicates, in bytes, starting with 0, the ending position of the currently executing statement for the currently executing batch or persisted object. Can be used together with the `sql_handle`, the `statement_start_offset`, and the `sys.dm_exec_sql_text` dynamic management function to retrieve the currently executing statement for the request. Nullable. |
| plan_handle | **varbinary(64)** | Is a token that uniquely identifies a query execution plan for a batch that is currently executing. Nullable. |
| database_id | **smallint** | ID of the database the request is executing against. Not nullable. <br /><br />In [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)], the values are unique within a single database or an elastic pool, but not within a logical server.|
| user_id | **int** | ID of the user who submitted the request. Not nullable. |
| connection_id | **uniqueidentifier** | ID of the connection on which the request arrived. Nullable. |
| blocking_session_id | **smallint** | ID of the session that is blocking the request. If this column is NULL or equal to 0, the request isn't blocked, or the session information of the blocking session isn't available (or can't be identified). For more information, see [Understand and resolve SQL Server blocking problems](/troubleshoot/sql/performance/understand-resolve-blocking).<br /><br />-2 = The blocking resource is owned by an orphaned distributed transaction.<br /><br />-3 = The blocking resource is owned by a deferred recovery transaction.<br /><br />-4 = Session ID of the blocking latch owner couldn't be determined at this time because of internal latch state transitions.<br /><br />-5 = Session ID of the blocking latch owner couldn't be determined because it isn't tracked for this latch type (for example, for an SH latch).<br /><br />By itself, blocking_session_id -5 doesn't indicate a performance problem. -5 is an indication that the session is waiting on an asynchronous action to complete. Before -5 was introduced, the same session would have shown blocking_session_id 0, even though it was still in a wait state.<br /><br />Depending on workload, observing -5 as blocking_session_id may be a common occurrence. |

## Remarks

To execute code that is outside [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (for example, extended stored procedures and distributed queries), a thread has to execute outside the control of the non-preemptive scheduler. To do this, a worker switches to preemptive mode. Time values returned by this dynamic management view don't include time spent in preemptive mode.

When executing parallel requests in [row mode](../query-processing-architecture-guide.md#row-mode-execution), [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] assigns a worker thread to coordinate the worker threads responsible for completing tasks assigned to them. In this DMV, only the coordinator thread is visible for the request. The columns `reads`, `writes`, `logical_reads`, and `row_count` are **not updated** for the coordinator thread. The columns `wait_type`, `wait_time`, `last_wait_type`, `wait_resource`, and `granted_query_memory` are **only updated** for the coordinator thread. For more information, see the [Thread and Task Architecture Guide](../thread-and-task-architecture-guide.md).

## Permissions

If the user has `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission on the server, the user will see all executing sessions on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]; otherwise, the user will see only the current session. `VIEW SERVER STATE` can't be granted in Azure SQL Database so `sys.dm_exec_requests` is always limited to the current connection.

In availability group scenarios, if the secondary replica is set to **read-intent only**, the connection to the secondary must specify its application intent in connection string parameters by adding `applicationintent=readonly`. Otherwise, the access check for `sys.dm_exec_requests` won't pass for databases in the availability group, even if `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission is present.

For [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] and later versions, `sys.dm_exec_requests` requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.

## Examples

### A. Find the query text for a running batch

 The following example queries `sys.dm_exec_requests` to find the interesting query and copy its `sql_handle` from the output.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_requests;
GO
```

Then, to obtain the statement text, use the copied `sql_handle` with system function `sys.dm_exec_sql_text(sql_handle)`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_sql_text(< copied sql_handle >);
GO
```

### B. Find all locks that a running batch is holding

The following example queries `sys.dm_exec_requests` to find the interesting batch and copy its `transaction_id` from the output.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_requests;
GO
```

Then, to find lock information, use the copied `transaction_id` with the system function `sys.dm_tran_locks`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_tran_locks
WHERE request_owner_type = N'TRANSACTION'
    AND request_owner_id = < copied transaction_id >;
GO
```

### C. Find all currently blocked requests

The following example queries `sys.dm_exec_requests` to find information about blocked requests.

```sql
SELECT session_id,
    status,
    blocking_session_id,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    transaction_id
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests
WHERE status = N'suspended';
GO
```

### D. Order existing requests by CPU

```sql
SELECT
    [req].[session_id],
    [req].[start_time],
    [req].[cpu_time] AS [cpu_time_ms],
    OBJECT_NAME([ST].[objectid], [ST].[dbid]) AS [ObjectName],
    SUBSTRING(
        REPLACE(
            REPLACE(
                SUBSTRING(
                    [ST].[text], ([req].[statement_start_offset] / 2) + 1,
                    ((CASE [req].[statement_end_offset]
                            WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH([ST].[text])
                            ELSE [req].[statement_end_offset]
                        END - [req].[statement_start_offset]
                        ) / 2
                    ) + 1
                ), CHAR(10), ' '
            ), CHAR(13), ' '
        ), 1, 512
    ) AS [statement_text]
FROM
    [sys].[dm_exec_requests] AS [req]
    CROSS APPLY [sys].dm_exec_sql_text([req].[sql_handle]) AS [ST]
ORDER BY
    [req].[cpu_time] DESC;
GO
```
