# sys.dm_os_memory_cache_entries (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [sql-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asa-pdw.md)]

  Returns information about all entries in caches in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Use this view to trace cache entries to their associated objects. You can also use this view to obtain statistics on cache entries.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To call this from [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)], use the name **sys.dm_pdw_nodes_os_memory_cache_entries**.

|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**cache_address**|**varbinary(8)**|Address of the cache. Is not nullable.|  
|**name**|**nvarchar(256)**|Name of the cache. Is not nullable.|  
|**type**|**varchar(60)**|Type of cache. Is not nullable.|  
|**entry_address**|**varbinary(8)**|Address of the descriptor of the cache entry. Is not nullable.|  
|**entry_data_address**|**varbinary(8)**|Address of the user data in the cache entry.<br /><br /> 0x00000000 = Entry data address is not available.<br /><br /> Is not nullable.|  
|**in_use_count**|**int**|Number of concurrent users of this cache entry. Is not nullable.|  
|**is_dirty**|**bit**|Indicates whether this cache entry is marked for removal. 1 = marked for removal. Is not nullable.|  
|**disk_ios_count**|**int**|Number of I/Os incurred while this entry was created. Is not nullable.|  
|**context_switches_count**|**int**|Number of context switches incurred while this entry was created. Is not nullable.|  
|**original_cost**|**int**|Original cost of the entry. This value is an approximation of the number of I/Os incurred, CPU instruction cost, and the amount of memory consumed by entry. The greater the cost, the lower the chance that the item will be removed from the cache. Is not nullable.|

|**pages_allocated_count**|**bigint**|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[sql2008r2](../../includes/sql2008r2-md.md)].<br /><br /> Number of 8-KB pages to store this cache entry. Is not nullable.|  
|**pages_kb**|**bigint**|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.<br /><br /> Amount of memory in kilobytes (KB) used by this cache entry.  Is not nullable.|  
|**entry_data**|**nvarchar(2048)**|Serialized representation of the cached entry. This information is cache store dependant. Is nullable.|  
|**pool_id**|**int**|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[sql2008r2](../../includes/sql2008r2-md.md)] and later.<br /><br /> Resource pool id associated with entry. Is nullable.<br /><br /> not katmai|  
|**pdw_node_id**|**int**|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]<br /><br /> The identifier for the node that this distribution is on.|  
  
## Permissions 

On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and SQL Managed Instance, requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission.

On SQL Database **Basic**, **S0**, and **S1** service objectives, and for databases in **elastic pools**, the [server admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/logins-create-manage#existing-logins-and-user-accounts-after-creating-a-new-database) account, the [Azure Active Directory admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview#administrator-structure) account, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` [server role](/azure/azure-sql/database/security-server-roles) is required. On all other SQL Database service objectives, either the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission on the database, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` server role is required.   

### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

Requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.
