## Permissions  
Requires VIEW SERVER STATE permission on the server.  
  
### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

## Remarks  

The packages registered with the extended events engine expose events, the actions that can be taken at the time of event firing, and targets for both synchronous and asynchronous processing of event data.  
  
These packages can be dynamically loaded into a process address space. At the time the package is loaded, it registers all the objects it exposes with the extended events engine.
