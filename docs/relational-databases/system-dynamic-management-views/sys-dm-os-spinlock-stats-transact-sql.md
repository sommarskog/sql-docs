# sys.dm_os_spinlock_stats (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Returns information about all spinlock waits organized by type.

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | **nvarchar(256)** | Name of the spinlock type. |
| collisions | **bigint** | The number of times a thread attempts to acquire the spinlock and is blocked because another thread currently holds the spinlock. |
| spins | **bigint** | The number of times a thread executes a loop while attempting to acquire the spinlock. |
| spins_per_collision | **real** | Ratio of spins per collision. |
| sleep_time | **bigint** | The amount of time in milliseconds that threads spent sleeping in the event of a backoff. |
| backoffs | **bigint** | The number of times a thread that is "spinning" fails to acquire the spinlock and yields the scheduler. |

## Permissions

On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and SQL Managed Instance, requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission.

On Azure SQL Database **Basic**, **S0**, and **S1** service objectives, and for databases in **elastic pools**, the [server admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/logins-create-manage#existing-logins-and-user-accounts-after-creating-a-new-database) account, the [Azure Active Directory admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview#administrator-structure) account, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` [server role](/azure/azure-sql/database/security-server-roles) is required. On all other SQL Database service objectives, either the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission on the database, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` server role is required.

### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

Requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.

## Remarks

`sys.dm_os_spinlock_stats` can be used to identify the source of spinlock contention. In some situations, you may be able to resolve or reduce spinlock contention. However, there might be situations that will require that you to contact [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Customer Support Services.

You can reset the contents of `sys.dm_os_spinlock_stats` by using `DBCC SQLPERF` as follows:

```sql
DBCC SQLPERF ('sys.dm_os_spinlock_stats', CLEAR);
GO
```

This resets all counters to 0.

> [!NOTE]  
> These statistics are not persisted if [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is restarted. All data is cumulative since the last time the statistics were reset, or since [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] was started.

## Spinlocks

A spinlock is a lightweight synchronization object used to serialize access to data structures which are typically held for a short period of time. When a thread attempts to access a resource protected by a spinlock which is being held by another thread, the thread will execute a loop, or "spin" and try accessing the resource again, rather than immediately yielding the scheduler as with a latch or other resource wait. The thread will continue spinning until the resource is available, or the loop completes, at which point the thread will yield the scheduler and go back into the runnable queue. This practice helps reduce excessive thread context switching, but when contention for a spinlock is high, significant CPU utilization may be observed.

Internal adjustments to the Database Engine introduced in [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] make spinlocks more efficient.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you have a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installed on Intel Skylake processors please review [KB4538688](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4538688) to apply the required update and enable [Trace Flag 8101](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md#tf8101).

The following table contains brief descriptions of some of the most common spinlock types.

| BACKUP_CTX | Protects access to list of pages involved in I/O while a backup is happening on that particular database. High spins could be observed when long checkpoints or lazwriter activity happen during backup operations. You can obtain relief using one of the following methods:<br /><br />- a) Use [indirect checkpoint](../../relational-databases/logs/database-checkpoints-sql-server.md#IndirectChkpt) instead of [automatic checkpoint](../../relational-databases/logs/database-checkpoints-sql-server.md#AutomaticChkpt)<br /><br />- b) Minimize lazywriter activity by properly allocating memory required for this instance<br /><br />- c) Avoid too many concurrent backups for databases on the instance |
