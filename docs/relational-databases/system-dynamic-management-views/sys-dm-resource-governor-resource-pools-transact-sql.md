## Remarks  
 Resource Governor workload groups and Resource Governor resource pools have a many-to-one mapping. As a result, many of the resource pool statistics are derived from the workload group statistics.  
  
 This dynamic management view shows the in-memory configuration. To see the stored configuration metadata, use the sys.resource_governor_resource_pools catalog view.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission.  
  
### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

Requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.
