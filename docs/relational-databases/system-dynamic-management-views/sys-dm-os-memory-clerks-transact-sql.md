## Permissions

On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission.   
On [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] Basic, S0, and S1 service objectives, and for databases in elastic pools, the [server admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/logins-create-manage#existing-logins-and-user-accounts-after-creating-a-new-database) account or the [Azure Active Directory admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview#administrator-structure) account is required. On all other [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] service objectives, the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission is required in the database.   
  
### Permissions for SQL Server 2022 and later

Requires VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE permission on the server.

## Remarks

 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] memory manager consists of a three-layer hierarchy. At the bottom of the hierarchy are memory nodes. The middle level consists of memory clerks, memory caches, and memory pools. The top layer consists of memory objects. These objects are used to allocate memory in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 Memory nodes provide the interface and the implementation for low-level allocators. Inside [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], only memory clerks have access to memory nodes. Memory clerks access memory node interfaces to allocate memory. Memory nodes also track the memory allocated by using the clerk for diagnostics. Every component that allocates a significant amount of memory must create its own memory clerk and allocate all its memory by using the clerk interfaces. Frequently, components create their corresponding clerks at the time [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is started.  

### CACHESTORE and USERSTORE

CACHESTORE and USERSTORE are memory clerks but function as actual caches. Typically, caches keep allocations until a cache removal policy releases those allocations. To avoid re-creating it, a cached allocation is retained in cache as long as possible and is ordinarily removed from the cache when it is too old to be useful, or when the memory space is needed for new information (for more information, see [clock hand sweep](sys-dm-os-memory-cache-clock-hands-transact-sql.md#remarks)). This is one of the two major controls for caches - lifetime control and visibility control.

Cache store and user store differ in the way they control lifetime of allocations. In the case of a cache store, the lifetime of entries is fully controlled by SQLOS's caching framework. With user store, entries lifetime is only partially controlled by a store. The implementation of each user store may be specific to the nature of memory allocations and therefore user stores participate in lifetime control of its entries. 

Visibility control manages visibility of an entry. An entry in a cache can exist but might not be visible. For example, if a cache entry is marked for single use only, the entry will not be visible after it is used. In addition, the cache entry might be marked as dirty; it will continue to live in the cache but won't be visible to any lookups. For both stores, entry visibility is controlled by the caching framework.

For more information, see [SQLOS Caching](/archive/blogs/slavao/sqlos-caching).

### OBJECTSTORE

Object store is a simple pool. It is used to cache homogeneous data. All entries in the pools are considered equal.  Object stores implement a maximum cap to control size relative to other caches.

For more information, see [SQLOS Caching](/archive/blogs/slavao/sqlos-caching).
