|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**session_id** |**int**| ID of the session.<br /><br /> 0 = the data returned in this row is an aggregate of all sessions since the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] was last started. |
|**start_time** |**datetime**| Time the session began.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the time aggregated data collection began. |
|**end_time** |**datetime**|Time the session ended.<br /><br /> `NULL` = session is active.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the time the last session ended.|
|**duration** |**int**|The duration (in seconds) of the session.<br /><br /> 0 = the session does not contain change data capture transactions.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the sum of the duration (in seconds) of all sessions with change feed transactions.|
|**batch_processing_phase** |**nvarchar(200)**| The stage of scan reached in a particular log scan session. The following are the currently implemented phases:<BR>1: Reading configuration<BR>2: First scan, building hash table<BR>3: Second scan<BR>4: Second scan<BR>5: Second scan<BR>6: Schema versioning<BR>7: Last scan, publish and commit.<BR>8: Done|
|**error_count** |**int**|Number of errors encountered.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the total number of errors in all sessions. |
|**batch_start_lsn** |**nvarchar(23)**|Starting LSN for the session.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the starting LSN for the last session. |
|**currently_processed_lsn** |**nvarchar(23)**|Current LSN being scanned.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the current LSN is 0.|
|**batch_end_lsn** |**nvarchar(23)**|Ending LSN for the session.<br /><br /> `NULL` = session is active.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the ending LSN for the last session.|
|**tran_count** |**bigint**|Number of change data capture transactions processed. This counter is populated in `batch_processing_phase` 2.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the number of processed transactions in all sessions. |
|**currently_processed_commit_lsn** |**nvarchar(23)**|LSN of the last commit log record processed.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the last commit log record LSN for any session.|
|**currently_processed_commit_time** |**datetime**|Time the last commit log record was processed.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the time the last commit log record for any session.|
|**log_record_count** | **bigint**|Number of log records scanned.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, number of records scanned for all sessions.|
|**schema_change_count** |**int**|Number of data definition language (DDL) operations detected. This counter is populated in `batch_processing_phase` 6.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the number of DDL operations processed in all sessions.|
|**command_count** |**bigint**|Number of commands processed.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the number of commands processed in all sessions.|
|**latency** | **int**|The difference, in seconds, between `end_time` and `currently_processed_commit_time`, in the session. This counter is populated at the end of `batch_processing_phase` 7.<br /><br /> When `session_id` = 0, the last nonzero latency value recorded by a session.|
|**empty_scan_count** |**int**|Number of consecutive sessions that contained no captured transactions.|
|**failed_sessions_count** |**int**|Number of sessions that failed.|
