# Troubleshoot a Full Transaction Log (SQL Server Error 9002)
 
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
 
 
 ### Option 1: Run the steps directly in an executable notebook via Azure Data Studio

> [!NOTE]
> Before attempting to open this notebook, check that Azure Data Studio is installed on your local machine. To install, go to [Learn how to install Azure Data Studio](../../azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio.md).

 ### Option 2: Follow the step manually
 
 
  This topic discusses possible responses to a full transaction log and suggests how to avoid it in the future. 
  
  When the transaction log becomes full, [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] issues a **9002 error**. The log can fill when the database is online, or in recovery. If the log fills while the database is online, the database remains online but can only be read, not updated. If the log fills during recovery, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] marks the database as RESOURCE PENDING. In either case, user action is required to make log space available.  

> [!NOTE]
> **This article is focused on SQL Server.** For more specific information on this error in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance, see [Troubleshooting transaction log errors with Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/database/troubleshoot-transaction-log-errors-issues). Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance are based on the latest stable version of the Microsoft SQL Server database engine, so much of the content is similar though troubleshooting options and tools may differ.
  
## Common reasons for a full transaction log

 The appropriate response to a full transaction log depends on what conditions caused the log to fill.  Common causes include: 

 - Log not being truncated
 - Disk volume is full
 - Log size is set to a fixed maximum value or autogrow is disabled
 - Replication or availability group synchronization that is unable to complete


## How to resolve a full transaction log

The following specific steps will help you find the reason for a full transaction log and resolve the issue.

## 1. Truncate the Log

A very common solution to this problem is to ensure transaction log backups are performed for your database which will ensure the log is truncated. If no recent transaction log history is indicated for the database with a full transaction log, the solution to the problem is straightforward: resume regular transaction log backups of the database. 

### Log truncation explained

There's a difference between truncating a transaction log and shrinking a transaction log. [Log Truncation](the-transaction-log-sql-server.md#Truncation) occurs normally during a transaction log backup, and is a logical operation which removes committed records inside the log, whereas [log shrinking](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-shrinkfile-transact-sql.md#shrinking-a-log-file) reclaims physical space on the file system by reducing the file size. Log truncation occurs on a [virtual-log-file (VLF)](../sql-server-transaction-log-architecture-and-management-guide.md#physical_arch) boundary, and a log file may contain many VLFs. A log file can be shrunk only if there's empty space inside the log file to reclaim. Shrinking a log file alone can't solve the problem of a full log file, instead, you must discover why the log file is full and can't be truncated.

> [!WARNING]
> Data that is moved to shrink a file can be scattered to any available location in the file. This causes index fragmentation and might slow the performance of queries that search a range of the index. To eliminate the fragmentation, consider rebuilding the indexes on the file after shrinking.  For more information, see [Shrink a database](../databases/shrink-a-database.md).

### What is preventing log truncation?

To discover what is preventing log truncation in a given case, use the `log_reuse_wait` and `log_reuse_wait_desc` columns of the `sys.databases` catalog view. For more information, see [sys.databases &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-databases-transact-sql.md). For descriptions of factors that can delay log truncation, see [The Transaction Log &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/logs/the-transaction-log-sql-server.md).

The following set of T-SQL commands will help you identify if a database transaction log isn't truncated and the reason for it. The following script will also recommend steps to resolve the issue:

### LOG_BACKUP log_reuse_wait

The most common actions you can consider here is to review your database recovery model and backup the transaction log of your database. 

#### Consider the database's recovery model


The transaction log may be failing to truncate with LOG_BACKUP log_reuse_wait category, because you have never backed it up. In many of those cases, your database is using FULL or BULK_LOGGED recovery model, but you did not back up transaction logs. You should consider each database recovery model carefully: perform transaction log backups on all databases in FULL or BULK LOGGED recovery models to minimize occurrences of error 9002. For more information, see [Recovery Models](../backup-restore/recovery-models-sql-server.md).


#### Back up the log

Under the FULL or BULK_LOGGED recovery model, if the transaction log has not been backed up recently, backup might be what is preventing log truncation. You must back up the transaction log to allow log records to be released and the log truncated. If the log has never been backed up, you **must create two log backups** to permit the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] to truncate the log to the point of the last backup. Truncating the log frees logical space for new log records. To keep the log from filling up again, take log backups regularly and more frequently. For more information, see [Recovery Models](../backup-restore/recovery-models-sql-server.md).

A complete history of all SQL Server backup and restore operations on a server instance is stored in the `msdb` system database. To review the complete backup history of a database, use the following sample script:

```sql
SELECT bs.database_name
, backuptype = CASE 
	WHEN bs.type = 'D' and bs.is_copy_only = 0 THEN 'Full Database'
	WHEN bs.type = 'D' and bs.is_copy_only = 1 THEN 'Full Copy-Only Database'
	WHEN bs.type = 'I' THEN 'Differential database backup'
	WHEN bs.type = 'L' THEN 'Transaction Log'
	WHEN bs.type = 'F' THEN 'File or filegroup'
	WHEN bs.type = 'G' THEN 'Differential file'
	WHEN bs.type = 'P' THEN 'Partial'
	WHEN bs.type = 'Q' THEN 'Differential partial' END + ' Backup'
, bs.recovery_model
, BackupStartDate = bs.Backup_Start_Date
, BackupFinishDate = bs.Backup_Finish_Date
, LatestBackupLocation = bf.physical_device_name
, backup_size_mb = bs.backup_size/1024./1024.
, compressed_backup_size_mb = bs.compressed_backup_size/1024./1024.
, database_backup_lsn -- For tlog and differential backups, this is the checkpoint_lsn of the FULL backup it is based on. 
, checkpoint_lsn
, begins_log_chain
FROM msdb.dbo.backupset bs	
LEFT OUTER JOIN msdb.dbo.backupmediafamily bf ON bs.[media_set_id] = bf.[media_set_id]
WHERE recovery_model in ('FULL', 'BULK-LOGGED')
AND bs.backup_start_date > DATEADD(month, -2, sysdatetime()) --only look at last two months
ORDER BY bs.database_name asc, bs.Backup_Start_Date desc;
```

A complete history of all SQL Server backup and restore operations on a server instance is stored in the `msdb` system database. For more information on backup history, see [Backup History and Header Information (SQL Server)](../backup-restore/backup-history-and-header-information-sql-server.md).

#### Create a transaction log backup

Example of how to back up the log:

```sql
BACKUP LOG [dbname] TO DISK = 'some_volume:\some_folder\dbname_LOG.trn'
```

- [Back Up a Transaction Log &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/back-up-a-transaction-log-sql-server.md)  
  
- <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Backup.SqlBackup%2A> (SMO)  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If the database is damaged, see [Tail-Log Backups &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/tail-log-backups-sql-server.md).  


  
### ACTIVE_TRANSACTION log_reuse_wait

The steps to troubleshoot ACTIVE_TRANSACTION reason include discovering the long running transaction and resolving it (in some case using the KILL command to do so).

#### Discover long-running transactions

A very long-running transaction can cause the transaction log to fill. To look for long-running transactions, use one of the following:

- **[sys.dm_tran_database_transactions](../system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-tran-database-transactions-transact-sql.md).**

This dynamic management view returns information about transactions at the database level. For a long-running transaction, columns of particular interest include the time of the first log record [(database_transaction_begin_time)](../system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-tran-database-transactions-transact-sql.md), the current state of the transaction [(database_transaction_state)](../system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-tran-database-transactions-transact-sql.md), and the [log sequence number (LSN)](../backup-restore/recover-to-a-log-sequence-number-sql-server.md) of the begin record in the transaction log [(database_transaction_begin_lsn)](../system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-tran-database-transactions-transact-sql.md).

- **[DBCC OPENTRAN](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-opentran-transact-sql.md).**
This statement lets you identify the user ID of the owner of the transaction, so you can potentially track down the source of the transaction for a more orderly termination (committing it rather than rolling it back).

##### Kill a transaction

Sometimes you just have to end the transaction; you may have to use the [KILL](../../t-sql/language-elements/kill-transact-sql.md) statement. Please use this statement very carefully,  especially when critical processes are running that you don't want to kill. For more information, see [KILL (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/language-elements/kill-transact-sql.md)

### AVAILABILITY_REPLICA log_reuse_wait

When transaction changes at primary Availability replica are not yet hardened on the secondary replica, the transaction log on the primary replica cannot be  truncated. This can cause the log to grow, and can occur whether the secondary replica is set for synchronous or asynchronous commit mode. For information on how to troubleshoot this type of issue see [Error 9002. The transaction log for database is full due to AVAILABILITY_REPLICA error](/troubleshoot/sql/availability-groups/error-9002-transaction-log-large)

### CHECKPOINT log_reuse_wait

No checkpoint has occurred since the last log truncation, or the head of the log has not yet moved beyond a virtual log file (VLF). (All recovery models)

This is a routine reason for delaying log truncation. If delayed, consider executing the `CHECKPOINT` command on the database or examining the log [VLFs](../../relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-log-architecture-and-management-guide.md#physical_arch). 

```sql
USE dbname; CHECKPOINT
select * from sys.dm_db_log_info(db_id('dbname'))
```

### For more information on log_reuse_wait factors

For more details see [Factors that can delay log truncation](../../relational-databases/logs/the-transaction-log-sql-server.md#FactorsThatDelayTruncation)

## 2. Resolve full disk volume

In some situations the disk volume that hosts the transaction log file may fill up. You can take one of the following actions to resolve the log-full scenario that results from a full disk:

### Free disk space  

 You might be able to free disk space on the disk drive that contains the transaction log file for the database by deleting or moving other files. The freed disk space allows the recovery system to enlarge the log file automatically.  
  
### Move the log file to a different disk  

If you cannot free enough disk space on the drive that currently contains the log file, consider moving the file to another drive with sufficient space.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Log files should never be placed on compressed file systems.  
  
See [Move Database Files](../../relational-databases/databases/move-database-files.md) for information on how to change the location of a log file.
  
### Add a log file on a different disk  

Add a new log file to the database on a different disk that has sufficient space by using `ALTER DATABASE <database_name> ADD LOG FILE`. Multiple log files for a single database should be considered a temporary condition to resolve a space issue, not a long-term condition. Most databases should only have one transaction log file. Continue to investigate the reason why the transaction log is full and cannot be truncated. Consider adding temporary additional transaction log files as an advanced troubleshooting step.

### Utility script for recommended actions


These steps can be partly automated by running this T-SQL script which will identify logs files that using a large percentage of disk space and suggest actions:


```sql
DECLARE @log_reached_disk_size BIT = 0

    name LogName, 
    physical_name, 
    CONVERT(bigint, size)*8/1024 LogFile_Size_MB,

    available_bytes/1024/1024 Available_Disk_space_MB,
    (CONVERT(bigint, size)*8.0/1024)/(available_bytes/1024/1024 )*100 file_size_as_percentage_of_disk_space,
    db_name(mf.database_id) DbName
FROM sys.master_files mf CROSS APPLY sys.dm_os_volume_stats (mf.database_id, file_id)
WHERE mf.[type_desc] = 'LOG'
    AND (CONVERT(bigint, size)*8.0/1024)/(available_bytes/1024/1024 )*100 > 90 --log is 90% of disk drive
ORDER BY size DESC

        SELECT 'If shrink does not reduce the file size, likely it is because it has not been truncated. Please review next section below. See https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-shrinkfile-transact-sql' AS TruncateFirst
        SELECT 'Can you free some disk space on this volume? If so, do this to allow for the log to continue growing when needed.' AS FreeDiskSpace




         FETCH NEXT FROM log_filled_disk into @db_name_filled_disk , @log_name_filled_disk

    END

    CLOSE log_filled_disk
    DEALLOCATE log_filled_disk

END

```

## 3. Change log size limit or enable Autogrow

Error 9002 can be generated if the transaction log size has been set to an upper limit or Autogrow is not allowed. In this case, enabling autogrow or increasing the log size manually can help resolve the issue. Use this T-SQL command to find such log files and follow the recommendations provided:

```sql

       CONVERT(bigint,max_size)*8/1024 LogFile_MaxSize_MB ,
       (SIZE*8.0/1024)/(max_size*8.0/1024)*100 percent_full_of_max_size,
       CASE WHEN growth = 0 THEN 'AUTOGROW_DISABLED' ELSE 'Autogrow_Enabled' END as AutoGrow

    END

    CLOSE reached_max_size
    DEALLOCATE reached_max_size
END
ELSE
    SELECT 'Found no files that have reached max log file size' as Findings
```

### Increase log file size or enable Autogrow

If space is available on the log disk, you can increase the size of the log file. The maximum size for log files is two terabytes (TB) per log file.  

If autogrow is disabled, the database is online, and sufficient space is available on the disk, do either of these:  
  
- Manually increase the file size to produce a single growth increment. These are [general recommendations](../../relational-databases/logs/manage-the-size-of-the-transaction-log-file.md#Recommendations) on log size growth and size.
- Turn on autogrow by using the ALTER DATABASE statement to set a non-zero growth increment for the FILEGROWTH option. See [Considerations for the autogrow and autoshrink settings in SQL Server](/troubleshoot/sql/admin/considerations-autogrow-autoshrink)  
  
> [!NOTE]
> In either case, if the current size limit has been reached, increase the MAXSIZE value.
