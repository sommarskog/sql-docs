# Configure a Firewall for FILESTREAM Access
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  To use FILESTREAM in a firewall-protected environment, both the client and server must be able to resolve DNS names to the server that contains the FILESTREAM files. FILESTREAM requires the Windows file-sharing ports 139 and 445 to be open.  
  
### To open the Windows file-sharing ports on a computer that is running Windows 7  
  
1.  In Control Panel, open **Windows Firewall**.  
  
2.  In the left pane, click **Advanced settings**. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.  
  
3.  In the **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security** dialog box, in the left pane, click **Inbound Rules**, and then, in the right pane, click **New Rule**.  
  
4.  Follow the instructions in the New Inbound Rule wizard to add TCP port 139.  
  
5.  Repeat the previous step to add TCP port 445.  
  
6.  Close the **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security** dialog box.
