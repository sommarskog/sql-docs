# Sending Result Sets to the Server (Extended Stored Procedure API)

 When sending a result set to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the extended stored procedure should call the appropriate API as follows:  
  
-   The **srv_sendmsg** function may be called in any order before or after all rows (if any) have been sent with **srv_sendrow**. All messages must be sent to the client before the completion status is sent with **srv_senddone**.  
  
-   The **srv_sendrow** function is called once for each row sent to the client. All rows must be sent to the client before any messages, status values, or completion statuses are sent with **srv_sendmsg**, the **srv_status** argument of **srv_pfield**, or **srv_senddone**.  
  
-   Sending a row that has not had all its columns defined with **srv_describe** causes the application to raise an informational error message and return FAIL to the client. In this case, the row is not sent.
