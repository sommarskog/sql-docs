# SecurityCertificate Class
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  The [SecurityCertificate Class](../../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-configuration-classes/securitycertificate-class/securitycertificate-class.md) represents a security certificate. A certificate is a digitally signed statement that binds the value of a public key to the instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], which holds the corresponding private key. The certificate is issued from a certification authority.  
  
 With the [SecurityCertificate Class](../../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-configuration-classes/securitycertificate-class/securitycertificate-class.md), you can perform the following tasks:  
  
-   View the properties of the security certificate.  
  
-   Set the security certificate with the specified SHA thumbprint for the specified instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   Verify the SHA thumbprint for the specified instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
