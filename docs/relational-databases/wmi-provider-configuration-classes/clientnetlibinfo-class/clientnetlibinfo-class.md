# ClientNetLibInfo Class
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  The [ClientNetLibInfo Class](../../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-configuration-classes/clientnetlibinfo-class/clientnetlibinfo-class.md) represents information about the client network library.  
  
 The client network library file lets the client instance communicate over a network with an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using a specific network protocol.
