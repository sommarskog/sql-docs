# IBCPSession (Native Client OLE DB Provider)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  The **IBCPSession** interface exposes support for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] file-based bulk copy operations. The **IBCPSession** interface is exposed in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider under the same level as Sessions. In the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider, data source objects are factories for Session objects, and bulk copy operations are specified in the connection property SSPROP_ENABLEBULKCOPY. In addition, the SSPROP_ENABLEFASTLOAD property should be set to true.  
  
 Calling the **IDBCreateSession::CreateSession** method will then result in the creation of a **BulkCopySession** object. All the file-based bulk copy methods exposed through the **IBCPSession** object are then callable with nearly similar signatures on this **IBCPSession** object's **IBCPSession** interface.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider supports memory-based bulk copy operations through the [IRowsetFastLoad](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/irowsetfastload-ole-db.md) interface.  
  
 For more information about using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider for bulk copy operations, see [Performing Bulk Copy Operations](../../relational-databases/native-client/features/performing-bulk-copy-operations.md).  
  
 For a sample showing how to use the **IBCPSession** interface, see [IBCPSession::BCPDone &#40;OLE DB&#41;](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpdone-ole-db.md).
