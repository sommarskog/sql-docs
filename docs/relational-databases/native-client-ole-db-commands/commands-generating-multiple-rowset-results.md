# SQL Server Native Client Commands Generating Multiple-Rowset Results
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider can return multiple rowsets from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] statements. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] statements return multiple-rowset results under the following conditions:  
  
-   Batched SQL statements are submitted as a single command.  
  
-   Stored procedures implement a batch of SQL statements.  
  
## Batches  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider recognizes the semicolon character as a batch delimiter for SQL statements:  
  
```  
WCHAR*       wSQLString = L"SELECT * FROM Categories; "  
                          L"SELECT * FROM Products";  
```  
  
 Sending multiple SQL statements in one batch is more efficient than executing each SQL statement separately. Sending one batch reduces the network round trips from the client to the server.  
  
## Stored Procedures  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] returns a result set for each statement in a stored procedure, so most [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] stored procedures return multiple result sets.
