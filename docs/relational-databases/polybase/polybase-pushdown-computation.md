# Pushdown computations in PolyBase

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016.md)]

Pushdown computation improves the performance of queries on external data sources. Beginning in [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)], pushdown computations were available for Hadoop external data sources. [!INCLUDE[sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] introduced pushdown computations for other types of external data sources.  

> [!NOTE]
> To determine whether or not PolyBase pushdown computation is benefiting your query, see [How to tell if external pushdown occurred](polybase-how-to-tell-pushdown-computation.md).

### Pushdown computation and Hadoop providers

PolyBase currently supports two Hadoop providers: Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) and Cloudera Distributed Hadoop (CDH). There are no differences between the two features in terms of pushdown computation.

To use the computation pushdown functionality with Hadoop, the target Hadoop cluster must have the core components of HDFS, YARN and MapReduce, with the job history server enabled. PolyBase submits the pushdown query via MapReduce and pulls status from the job history server. Without either component, the query fails.

Some aggregation must occur after the data reaches [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. But a portion of the aggregation occurs in Hadoop. This method is common in computing aggregations in massively parallel processing systems.  

Hadoop providers support the following aggregations and filters.

| **Aggregations**                  | **Filters (binary comparison)** | 
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------| 
| Count_Big                         | NotEqual                        | 
| Sum                               | LessThan                        | 
| Avg                               | LessOrEqual                     | 
| Max                               | GreaterOrEqual                  | 
| Min                               | GreaterThan                     | 
| Approx_Count_Distinct             | Is                              | 
|                                   | IsNot                           | 

## Key beneficial scenarios of pushdown computation

With PolyBase pushdown computation, you can delegate computation tasks to external data sources. This reduces the workload on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance and can significantly improve performance. 

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can push joins, projections, aggregations, and filters to external data sources to take advantage of remote compute and restrict the data sent over the network. 

### Pushdown of joins

In many cases, PolyBase can facilitate pushdown of the join operator for the join of two external tables on same external data source, which will greatly improve performance.  

If the join can be done at the external data source, this reduces the amount of data movement and improves the query's performance. Without join pushdown, the data from the tables to be joined must be brought locally into tempdb, then joined.

Note that in the case of *distributed joins* (joining a local table to an external table), unless there is some filtering criteria on the external table that is applied to the join condition, all of the data in the external table must be brought locally into `tempdb` in order to perform the join operation. For example, the following query has no filtering on the external table join condition, which will result in all of the data from the external table being read.

```sql
SELECT * FROM LocalTable L
JOIN ExternalTable E on L.id = E.id
```

Since the join is on `E.id` column of the external table, if a filter condition is added to that column, the filter can be pushed down thereby reducing the number of rows read from the external table

```sql
SELECT * FROM LocalTable L
JOIN ExternalTable E on L.id = E.id
WHERE E.id = 20000
```

### Select a subset of rows

Use predicate pushdown to improve performance for a query that selects a subset of rows from an external table.

In this example, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] initiates a map-reduce job to retrieve the rows that match the predicate `customer.account_balance < 200000` on Hadoop. Because the query can complete successfully without scanning all of the rows in the table, only the rows that meet the predicate criteria are copied to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This saves significant time and requires less temporary storage space when the number of customer balances < 200000 is small in comparison with the number of customers with account balances >= 200000.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE customer.account_balance < 200000;
SELECT * FROM SensorData WHERE Speed > 65;  
```

### Select a subset of columns

Use predicate pushdown to improve performance for a query that selects a subset of columns from an external table.

In this query, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] initiates a map-reduce job to pre-process the Hadoop delimited-text file so that only the data for the two columns, customer.name and customer.zip_code, will be copied to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

```sql
SELECT customer.name, customer.zip_code
FROM customer
WHERE customer.account_balance < 200000;
```

### Pushdown for basic expressions and operators

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] allows the following basic expressions and operators for predicate pushdown.

- Binary comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `>=`, `<=`) for numeric, date, and time values.
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
- Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`).
- Unary operators (`NOT`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`).

The operators `BETWEEN`, `NOT`, `IN`, and `LIKE` might be pushed down. The actual behavior depends on how the query optimizer rewrites the operator expressions as a series of statements that use basic relational operators.

The query in this example has multiple predicates that can be pushed down to Hadoop. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can push map-reduce jobs to Hadoop to perform the predicate `customer.account_balance <= 200000`. The expression `BETWEEN 92656 AND 92677` is also composed of binary and logical operations that can be pushed to Hadoop. The logical **AND** in `customer.account_balance AND customer.zipcode` is a final expression.

Given this combination of predicates, the map-reduce jobs can perform all of the WHERE clause. Only the data that meets the `SELECT` criteria is copied back to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer 
WHERE customer.account_balance <= 200000 
AND customer.zipcode BETWEEN 92656 AND 92677;
```

### Supported functions for pushdown

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] allows the following functions for predicate pushdown.

String functions
- `CONCAT`
- `DATALENGTH`
- `LEN`
- `LIKE`
- `LOWER`
- `LTRIM`
- `RTRIM`
- `SUBSTRING`
- `UPPER`

Mathematical functions
- `ABS`
- `ACOS`
- `ASIN`
- `ATAN`
- `CEILING`
- `COS`
- `EXP`
- `FLOOR`
- `POWER`
- `SIGN`
- `SIN`
- `SQRT`
- `TAN`

General functions
- `COALESCE` \*
- `NULLIF`

\* Using with `COLLATE` can prevent pushdown in some scenarios. For more information, see [Collation conflict](#collation-conflict).

Date & time functions
- `DATEADD`
- `DATEDIFF`
- `DATEPART`

## Syntax that prevents pushdown

The following T-SQL functions or syntax will prevent pushdown computation:

- `AT TIME ZONE`
- `CONCAT_WS`
- `TRANSLATE`
- `RAND`
- `CHECKSUM`
- `BINARY_CHECKSUM`
- `HASHBYTES`
- `ISJSON`
- `JSON_VALUE`
- `JSON_QUERY`
- `JSON_MODIFY`
- `NEWID`
- `STRING_ESCAPE`
- `COMPRESS`
- `DECOMPRESS`
- `GREATEST`
- `LEAST`
- `PARSE`

Pushdown support for the `FORMAT` and `TRIM` syntax was introduced in [!INCLUDE[sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] CU10.

### Filter clause with variable

If you are specifying a variable in a filter clause, by default this will prevent pushdown of the filter clause. For example, if you run the following query, the filter clause will not be pushed down:

```sql
DECLARE @BusinessEntityID INT

SELECT * FROM [Person].[BusinessEntity]  
WHERE BusinessEntityID = @BusinessEntityID;
```

To achieve pushdown of the variable, you need to enable query optimizer hotfixes functionality. This can be done in any of the following ways:
- Instance Level: Enable trace flag 4199 as a startup parameter for the instance
- Database Level: In the context of the database that has the PolyBase external objects, execute ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION SET QUERY_OPTIMIZER_HOTFIXES = ON
- Query level: 
        Use query hint OPTION (QUERYTRACEON 4199) or OPTION (USE HINT ('ENABLE_QUERY_OPTIMIZER_HOTFIXES'))

This limitation applies to execution of [sp_executesql](../system-stored-procedures/sp-executesql-transact-sql.md).

Note: The ability to pushdown the variable was first introduced in SQL Server 2019 CU5.

### Collation conflict

When working with data with different collation pushdown might not be possible, operators like `COLLATE` can also interfere with the outcome. Equal collations or binary collations are supported. For more information, see [How to tell if pushdown occurred](polybase-how-to-tell-pushdown-computation.md).

## Pushdown for parquet files

Starting in [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)], PolyBase introduced support for parquet files. SQL Server is capable of performing both row and column elimination when performing pushdown with parquet. When working with parquet files, the following operations can be pushed down:

- Binary comparison operators (>, >=, <=, <) for numeric, date, and time values.
- Combination of comparison operators (> AND <, >= AND <, > AND <=, <= AND >=).
- In list filter (col1 = val1 OR col1 = val2 OR vol1 = val3).
- IS NOT NULL over column.

Presence of the following prevents pushdown for parquet files:

- Virtual columns.
- Column comparison.
- Parameter type conversion.

### Supported data types

- Bit
- TinyInt
- SmallInt
- BigInt
- Real
- Float
- VARCHAR (Bin2Collation, CodePageConversion, BinCollation)
- NVARCHAR (Bin2Collation, BinCollation)
- Binary
- DateTime2 (default and 7-digit precision)
- Date
- Time (default and 7-digit precision)
- Numeric \*

\* Supported when parameter scale aligns with column scale, or when parameter is explicitly cast to decimal.

### Data types that prevent parquet pushdown

- Money
- SmallMoney
- DateTime
- SmallDateTime

## Examples

### Force pushdown

```sql
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[SensorData]
WHERE Speed > 65
OPTION (FORCE EXTERNALPUSHDOWN);
```

### Disable pushdown

```sql
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[SensorData]
WHERE Speed > 65
OPTION (DISABLE EXTERNALPUSHDOWN);
```
