# Access WMI Provider for Configuration Management using WQL
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  This section describes how to execute [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Management Instrumentation Query Language (WQL) statements against the WMI Provider for Computer Management.  
  
 The example uses a WQL editor, WBEMtest.exe, to run WQL queries against the WMI Provider to enumerate [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services, network protocols, and aliases.  
  
### Querying services using WBEMtest  
  
1.  From the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then enter **WBEMtest**.  
  
2.  The WBEMtest.exe dialog appears. Click **Connect**.  
  
3.  In the first text field, type the WMI Provider for Computer Management namespace: root\Microsoft\SqlServer\ComputerManagement11. Click **Connect**.  
  
4.  Click **Query**. Type a query that returns the current services running on the local computer: **SELECT \* FROM SqlService.** Click **Apply**.  
  
5.  Further refine the query by adding **WHERE ServiceName = "MSSQLSERVER"**.
