# When to Use SQL Server Native Client

  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client is one technology that you can use to access data in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database.  For a discussion of the different data-access technologies, see [Data Access Technologies Road Map](../../connect/connect-history.md)  
  
 When deciding whether to use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client as the data access technology of your application, you should consider several factors.  
  
 For new applications, if you're using a managed programming language such as Microsoft Visual C# or Visual Basic, and you need to access the new features in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you should use the .NET Framework Data Provider for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], which is part of the .NET Framework.  
  
 If you are developing a COM-based application and need to access the new features introduced in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you should use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client. If you don't need access to the new features of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can continue to use Windows Data Access Components (WDAC).  
  
 For existing OLE DB and ODBC applications, the primary issue is whether you need to access the new features of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. If you have a mature application that does not need the new features of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can continue to use WDAC. But if you do need to access those new features, such as the [xml data type](../../t-sql/xml/xml-transact-sql.md), you should use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client.  
  
 Both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client and MDAC support read committed transaction isolation using row versioning, but only [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports snapshot transaction isolation. (In programming terms, read committed transaction isolation with row versioning is the same as Read-Committed transaction.)  
  
 For information about the differences between [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client and MDAC, see [Updating an Application to SQL Server Native Client from MDAC](../../relational-databases/native-client/applications/updating-an-application-to-sql-server-native-client-from-mdac.md).
