# Connecting to an Azure SQL Database Using SQL Server Native Client
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  For a sample that shows how to connect to a [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client, see [Development: How-to Topics (Azure SQL Database)](/previous-versions/azure/ee621787(v=azure.100)).  
  
## Known Issues When Connecting to a SQL Database  
 The following are known issues when connecting to a [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../includes/sssds-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client:  
  
-   A connection made with **SQLBrowseConnect** may be rejected if **SQLBrowseConnect** is used in stages.  For example, if the driver name is sent in the first call, server and credentials (user and password) sent in the second call, establishing the connection, and a database name and a language in the third call.  The third call will cause [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client to issue a USE statement to change databases. However, the USE statement is not supported in [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../includes/sssds-md.md)], generating the following error:  
  
    ```  
    [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0][SQL Server]USE statement is not supported to switch between databases. Use a new connection to connect to a different Database.  
    ```
