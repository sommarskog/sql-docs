# SQL Server Native Client (OLE DB)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> [!INCLUDE[snac-removed-oledb-only](../../../includes/snac-removed-oledb-only.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider (SQLNCLI) is a low-level COM API that is used for accessing data. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider is recommended for developing tools, utilities, or low-level components that need high performance. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider is a native, high performance provider that accesses the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol directly.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client provides OLE DB support to applications connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider is an OLE DB version 2.0-compliant provider.  
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB (SQLNCLI) remains deprecated and it is not recommended to use it for new development work. Instead, use the new [Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](../../../connect/oledb/oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md) (MSOLEDBSQL) which will be updated with the most recent server features.
