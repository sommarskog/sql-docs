# Service Principal Names (SPNs) in Client Connections (ODBC)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> [!INCLUDE[snac-removed-oledb-and-odbc](../../../includes/snac-removed-oledb-and-odbc.md)]

  This topic describes ODBC attributes and functions that support service principal names (SPNs) in client applications. For more information about SPNs in client applications, see [Service Principal Name &#40;SPN&#41; Support in Client Connections](../../../relational-databases/native-client/features/service-principal-name-spn-support-in-client-connections.md) and [Get Mutual Kerberos Authentication](../../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-how-to/get-mutual-kerberos-authentication.md).  
  
## Connection String Keywords  
 The following connection string keywords enable client applications to specify an SPN.  
  
|Keyword|Value|  
|-------------|-----------|  
|**ServerSPN**|The SPN for the server. The default value is an empty string, which causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client to use the default, driver-generated SPN.|  
|**FailoverPartnerSPN**|The SPN for the failover partner. The default value is an empty string, which causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client to use the default, driver-generated SPN.|  
  
## Connection Attributes  
 The following connection attributes enable client applications to specify an SPN and query for the authentication method.  
  
|Name|Type|Usage|  
|----------|----------|-----------|  
|SQL_COPT_SS_SERVER_SPN<br /><br /> SQL_COPT_SS_FAILOVER_PARTNER_SPN|SQLTCHAR, read/write|Specifies the SPN for the server. The default value is an empty string, which causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client to use the default, driver-generated SPN.<br /><br /> This attribute can be queried only after it has been set programmatically, or after a connection has been opened. If an attempt is made to query this attribute on a connection that is not open and the attribute has not been set programmatically, SQL_ERROR is returned, and a diagnostic record is logged with SQLState 08003 and the message "Connection not open".<br /><br /> If an attempt is made to set this attribute when a connection is open, SQL_ERROR is returned, and a diagnostic record is logged with SQLState HY011 and the message "Operation invalid at this time".|  
|SQL_COPT_SS_INTEGRATED_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD|SQLTCHAR, read-only|Returns the authentication method used for the connection. The value returned to the application is the value that Windows returns to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client. Possible values are:<br /><br /> "NTLM", which is returned when a connection is opened using NTLM authentication.<br /><br /> "Kerberos", which is returned when a connection is opened using Kerberos authentication.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> This attribute can only be read for an open connection that used Windows Authentication. If an attempt is made to read it before a connection has been opened, SQL_ERROR is returned, and an error is logged with SQLState 08003 and the message "Connection not open".<br /><br /> If this attribute is queried on a connection that did not use Windows Authentication, SQL_ERROR is returned, and an error is logged with SQLState HY092 and the message "Invalid attribute/option identifier (SQL_COPT_SS_INTEGRATED_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD is only available for Trusted Connections)".<br /><br /> If the authentication method cannot be determined, SQL_ERROR is returned, and an error is logged with SQLState HY000 and the message "General error".|  
|SQL_COPT_SS_MUTUALLY_AUTHENTICATED|SQLSMALLINT, read-only|Returns SQL_TRUE if the server in the connection was mutually authenticated; otherwise, returns SQL_FALSE.<br /><br /> This attribute can only be read for an open connection. If an attempt is made to read it before a connection has been opened, SQL_ERROR is returned, and an error is logged with SQLState 08003 and the message "Connection not open".<br /><br /> If this attribute is queried for a connection that did not use Windows Authentication, SQL_FALSE is returned.|  
  
## ODBC Function Support for Specifying SPNs  
 The following ODBC functions support client applications and SPNs:

-   [SQLConnect](../../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-api/sqlconnect.md)  
  
-   [SQLDriverConnect](../../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-api/sqldriverconnect.md)  
  
-   [SQLGetConnectAttr](../../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-api/sqlgetconnectattr.md)
