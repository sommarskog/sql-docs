# SQL Server Native Client Support for LocalDB
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]

  Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], a lightweight version of SQL Server, called LocalDB, will be available. This topic discusses how to connect to a database in a LocalDB instance.  
  
## Remarks  
 For more information about LocalDB, including how to install LocalDB and configure your LocalDB instance, see:  
  
-   [SQL Server Express LocalDB Reference](../../../relational-databases/sql-server-express-localdb-reference.md)  
  
-   [SQL Server 2016 Express LocalDB](../../../database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb.md)  
  
 To summarize, LocalDB allows you to:  
  
-   Use **sqllocaldb.exe i** to discover the name of the default instance.  
  
-   Use the **AttachDBFilename** connection string keyword to specify which database file the server should attach. When using **AttachDBFilename**, if you do not specify the name of the database with the **Database** connection string keyword, the database will be removed from the LocalDB instance when the application closes.  
  
-   Specify a LocalDB instance in your connection string:  
  
```  
SERVER=(localdb)\v11.0  
```  
  
 If necessary, you can create a LocalDB instance with sqllocaldb.exe. You can also use sqlcmd.exe to add and modify databases in a LocalDB instance. For example, **sqlcmd -S (localdb)\v11.0**.
