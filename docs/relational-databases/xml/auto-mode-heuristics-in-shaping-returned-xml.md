# AUTO mode heuristics in shaping returned XML

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

AUTO mode determines the shape of returned XML based on the query. In determining how elements are to be nested, AUTO mode heuristics compare column values in adjacent rows. Columns of all types, except **ntext**, **text**, **image**, and **xml**, are compared. Columns of type **(n)varchar(max)** and **varbinary(max)** are compared.

The following example illustrates the AUTO mode heuristics that determine the shape of the resulting XML:

```sql
SELECT T1.Id, T2.Id, T1.Name
FROM   T1, T2
WHERE Col1 = 1 /* actual predicate goes here*/
ORDER BY T1.Id
FOR XML AUTO;
```

To determine where a new `<T1>` element starts, all column values of T1, except **ntext**, **text**, **image** and **xml**, are compared if the key on the table T1 isn't specified. Next, assume that the **Name** column is **nvarchar(40)** and the SELECT statement returns this rowset:

```output
T1.Id  T1.Name  T2.Id
-----------------------
1       Andrew    2
1       Andrew    3
1       Nancy     4
```

The AUTO mode heuristics compare all the values of table T1, the Id, and Name columns. The first two rows have the same values for the `Id` and `Name` columns. As a result, a single `<T1>` element, having two `<T2>` child elements, is added to the result.

Following is the XML that is returned:

```xml
<T1 Id="1" Name="Andrew">
    <T2 Id="2" />
    <T2 Id="3" />
</T1>
<T1 Id="1" Name="Nancy" >
      <T2 Id="4" />
</T>
```

Now assume that the `Name` column is of **text** type. The AUTO mode heuristics don't compare the values for this type. Instead, it assumes that the values aren't the same. This mode results in XML generation as shown in the following output:

```xml
<T1 Id="1" Name="Andrew" >
  <T2 Id="2" />
</T1>
<T1 Id="1" Name="Andrew" >
  <T2 Id="3" />
</T1>
<T1 Id="1" Name="Nancy" >
  <T2 Id="4" />
</T1>
```
