# FOR XML support for the user-defined data types (UDT)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

FOR XML doesn't support common language runtime (CLR) user-defined data types (UDTs).

To use FOR XML with CLR user-defined data types, make sure that the data type has an XML serialization, and use an explicit cast to XML in the FOR XML select clause.
