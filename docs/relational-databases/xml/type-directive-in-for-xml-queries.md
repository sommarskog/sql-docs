# TYPE directive in FOR XML queries

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] support for the [xml &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/xml/xml-transact-sql.md) data type enables you to optionally request that the result of a FOR XML query be returned as **xml** by specifying the TYPE directive. This allows you to process the result of a FOR XML query on the server. For example, you can specify an XQuery against it, assign the result to an **xml** type variable, or write [Nested FOR XML queries](../../relational-databases/xml/use-nested-for-xml-queries.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] returns **xml** data type instance data to the client as a result of different server-constructs such as FOR XML queries that use the TYPE directive, or where the **xml** data type is used to return XML instance data values from SQL table columns and output parameters. In client application code, the ADO.NET provider requests this **xml** data type information to be sent in a binary encoding from the server. However, if you are using FOR XML without the TYPE directive, the XML data comes back as a string type. In any case, the client provider will always be able to handle either form of XML. Note that top-level FOR XML without the TYPE directive cannot be used with cursors.

## Examples

The following examples illustrate the use of the TYPE directive with FOR XML queries.

### Retrieving FOR XML query results as xml type

The following query retrieves customer contact information from the `Contacts` table. Because the `TYPE` directive is specified in `FOR XML`, the result is returned as **xml** type.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
Go
SELECT BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Person.Person
ORDER BY BusinessEntityID
FOR XML AUTO, TYPE;
```

This is the partial result:

```xml
<Person.Person BusinessEntityID="1" FirstName="Ken" LastName="Sánchez"/>
<Person.Person BusinessEntityID="2" FirstName="Terri" LastName="Duffy"/>
...
```

### Assigning FOR XML query results to an xml type variable

In the following example, a FOR XML result is assigned to an **xml** type variable, `@x`. The query retrieves contact information, such as the `BusinessEntityID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and additional telephone numbers, from the `AdditionalContactInfo` column of **xml**`TYPE`. Because the `FOR XML` clause specifies `TYPE` directive, the XML is returned as **xml** type and is assigned to a variable.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
DECLARE @x xml;
SET @x = (
   SELECT BusinessEntityID,
          FirstName,
          LastName,
          AdditionalContactInfo.query('
declare namespace aci="https://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/adventure-works/ContactInfo";
declare namespace act="https://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/adventure-works/ContactTypes";
              //act:telephoneNumber/act:number') as MorePhoneNumbers
   FROM Person.Person
   FOR XML AUTO, TYPE);
SELECT @x;
GO
```

### Querying results of a FOR XML query

The FOR XML queries return XML. Therefore, you can apply **xml** type methods, such as `query()` and `value()`, to the XML result returned by FOR XML queries.

In the following query, the `query()` method of the **xml** data type is used to query the result of the `FOR XML` query. For more information, see [query&#40;&#41; Method &#40;xml Data Type&#41;](../../t-sql/xml/query-method-xml-data-type.md).

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
SELECT (SELECT BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName, AdditionalContactInfo.query('
DECLARE namespace aci="https://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/adventure-works/ContactInfo";
DECLARE namespace act="https://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/adventure-works/ContactTypes";
//act:telephoneNumber/act:number
') AS PhoneNumbers
FROM Person.Person
FOR XML AUTO, TYPE).query('/Person.Person[1]');
```

The inner `SELECT ... FOR XML` query returns an **xml** type result to which the outer `SELECT` applies the `query()` method to the **xml** type. Note the `TYPE` directive specified.

This is the result:

```xml
<Person.Person BusinessEntityID="1" FirstName="Ken" LastName="Sánchez">
  <PhoneNumbers>
    <act:number xmlns:act="https://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/adventure-works/ContactTypes">111-111-1111</act:number>
    <act:number xmlns:act="https://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/adventure-works/ContactTypes">112-111-1111</act:number>
  </PhoneNumbers>
</Person.Person>
```

In the following query, the `value()` method of the **xml** data type is used to retrieve a value from the XML result returned by the `SELECT...FOR XML` query. For more information, see [value&#40;&#41; Method &#40;xml Data Type&#41;](../../t-sql/xml/value-method-xml-data-type.md).

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO
DECLARE @FirstPhoneFromAdditionalContactInfo varchar(40);
SELECT @FirstPhoneFromAdditionalContactInfo =
( SELECT BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName, AdditionalContactInfo.query('
declare namespace aci="https://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/adventure-works/ContactInfo";
declare namespace act="https://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/adventure-works/ContactTypes";
   //act:telephoneNumber/act:number
   ') AS PhoneNumbers
   FROM Person.Person Contact
   FOR XML AUTO, TYPE).value('
declare namespace act="https://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/adventure-works/ContactTypes";
  /Contact[@BusinessEntityID="1"][1]/PhoneNumbers[1]/act:number[1]', 'varchar(40)'
);
SELECT @FirstPhoneFromAdditionalContactInfo;
```

The XQuery path expression in the `value()` method retrieves the first telephone number of a customer contact whose `BusinessEntityID` is `1`.

> [!NOTE]
> If the TYPE directive is not specified, the FOR XML query result is returned as type **nvarchar(max)**.

### Using FOR XML query results in INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE (Transact-SQL DML)

The following example demonstrates how FOR XML queries can be used in Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements. In the example, the `FOR XML` returns an instance of **xml** type. The `INSERT` statement inserts this XML into a table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE T1(intCol int, XmlCol xml);
GO
INSERT INTO T1
VALUES(1, '<Root><ProductDescription ProductModelID="1" /></Root>');
GO

CREATE TABLE T2(XmlCol xml)
GO
INSERT INTO T2(XmlCol)
SELECT (SELECT XmlCol.query('/Root')
        FROM T1
        FOR XML AUTO,TYPE);
GO
```
