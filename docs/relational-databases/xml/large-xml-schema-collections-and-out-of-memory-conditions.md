# Large XML schema collections and out-of-memory conditions

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb.md)]

During a call to the built-in XML_SCHEMA_NAMESPACE() function on a large XML schema collection, or when you try to drop large XML schema collections, an out-of-memory condition may occur. The following are solutions you can use to handle this:

- When the system load is light, use the DROP_XML_SCHEMA_COLLECTION command. If this fails, put the database in single-user mode by using the ALTER DATABASE statement and trying DROP XML SCHEMA COLLECTION again. If the XML schema collection exists in `master`, `model`, or `tempdb`, a server restart is required for single-user mode.

- When you call the XML_SCHEMA_NAMESPACE, you can try to retrieve a single XML schema namespace, you can try the call when the system load is lighter, or you can try the call in single-user mode.
