# Grant Permissions on a Stored Procedure
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]
  This article describes how to grant permissions on a stored procedure in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. Permissions can be granted to an existing user, database role, or application role in the database.  
  
##  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and restrictions  
  
-   You cannot use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to grant permissions on system procedures or system functions. Use [GRANT Object Permissions](../../t-sql/statements/grant-object-permissions-transact-sql.md) instead.  
  
##  <a name="Security"></a><a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 The grantor (or the principal specified with the AS option) must have either the permission itself with GRANT OPTION, or a higher permission that implies the permission being granted. Requires ALTER permission on the schema to which the procedure belongs, or CONTROL permission on the procedure. For more information, see [GRANT Object Permissions &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/grant-object-permissions-transact-sql.md).  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Use SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To grant permissions on a stored procedure  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **Databases**, expand the database in which the procedure belongs, and then expand **Programmability**.  
  
3.  Expand **Stored Procedures**, right-click the procedure to grant permissions on, and then select **Properties**.  
  
4.  From **Stored Procedure Properties**, select the **Permissions** page.  
  
5.  To grant permissions to a user, database role, or application role, select **Search**.  
  
6.  In **Select Users or Roles**, select **Object Types** to add or clear the users and roles you want.  
  
7.  Select **Browse** to display the list of users or roles. Select the users or roles to whom permissions should be granted.  
  
8.  In the **Explicit Permissions** grid, select the permissions to grant to the specified user or role. For a description of the permissions, see [Permissions &#40;Database Engine&#41;](../../relational-databases/security/permissions-database-engine.md).  

 Selecting **Grant** indicates the grantee will be given the specified permission. Selecting **Grant With** indicates that the grantee will also be able to grant the specified permission to other principals.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Use Transact-SQL  
  
#### To grant permissions on a stored procedure  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, select **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and select **Execute**. This example grants `EXECUTE` permission on the stored procedure `HumanResources.uspUpdateEmployeeHireInfo` to an application role named `Recruiting11`.  
  
```sql  
USE AdventureWorks2022;   
GRANT EXECUTE ON OBJECT::HumanResources.uspUpdateEmployeeHireInfo  
    TO Recruiting11;  
GO  
```  
  
#### To grant permissions on all stored procedures in a schema
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, select **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and select **Execute**. This example grants `EXECUTE` permission to all stored procedures that exist, or will exist, in the `HumanResources` schema, to an application role named `Recruiting11`. 
  
```sql  
USE AdventureWorks2022;   
GRANT EXECUTE ON SCHEMA::HumanResources
    TO Recruiting11;  
GO  
```
