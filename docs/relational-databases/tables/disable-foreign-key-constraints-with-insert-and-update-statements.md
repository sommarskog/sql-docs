# Disable foreign key constraints with INSERT and UPDATE statements
[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  You can disable a foreign key constraint during INSERT and UPDATE transactions in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. Use this option if you know that new data will not violate the existing constraint or if the constraint applies only to the data already in the database.  
  
##  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and restrictions  
 After you disable these constraints, future inserts or updates to the column will not be validated against the constraint conditions.  
  
##  <a name="Security"></a><a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Requires ALTER permission on the table.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Use SQL Server Management Studio
  
#### To disable a foreign key constraint for INSERT and UPDATE statements  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, expand the table with the constraint and then expand the **Keys** folder.  
  
2.  Right-click the constraint and select **Modify**.  
  
3.  In the grid under **Table Designer**, select **Enforce Foreign Key Constraint** and select **No** from the drop-down menu.  
  
4.  Select **Close**.  

5.  To re-enable the constraint when desired, reverse the above steps. Select **Enforce Foreign Key Constraint** and select **Yes** from the drop-down menu.  

6.  To trust the constraint by checking the existing data in the foreign key's relationship, select **Check Existing Data on Creation Or Re-Enabling** and select **Yes** from the drop-down menu. This would ensure the foreign key constraint is trusted. 

-   If **Check Existing Data on Creation Or Re-Enabling** is set to **No**, the foreign key does not check existing data when it is re-enabled. The query optimizer is therefore unable to consider potential performance improvements. Trusted foreign keys are recommended because they can be used to simplify execution plans with assumptions based on the foreign key constraint. To check whether foreign keys are trusted in your database, see a sample query later in this article.

  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Use Transact-SQL  
  
#### To disable a foreign key constraint for INSERT and UPDATE statements  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, select **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and select **Execute**.  
  
    ```sql  
    USE AdventureWorks2022;  
    GO  
    ALTER TABLE Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader  
    NOCHECK CONSTRAINT FK_PurchaseOrderHeader_Employee_EmployeeID;  
    GO  
    ```  

4.  To re-enable the constraint when desired, copy and paste the following example into the query window and select **Execute**.

    ```sql  
    USE AdventureWorks2022;  
    GO  
    ALTER TABLE Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader  
    CHECK CONSTRAINT FK_PurchaseOrderHeader_Employee_EmployeeID;  
    GO  
    ``` 

5. Verify that the constraint in your environment is both trusted and enabled. If `is_not_trusted` = 1, then the foreign key does not check existing data when it is re-enabled or re-created. The query optimizer is therefore unable to consider potential performance improvements. Trusted foreign keys are recommended because they can be used to simplify execution plans with assumptions based on the foreign key constraint. Copy and paste the following example into the query window and select **Execute**.

    ```sql
    SELECT o.name, fk.name, fk.is_not_trusted, fk.is_disabled
    FROM sys.foreign_keys AS fk
    INNER JOIN sys.objects AS o ON fk.parent_object_id = o.object_id
    WHERE fk.name = 'FK_PurchaseOrderHeader_Employee_EmployeeID';
    GO
    ```

    You should set the foreign key constraint to trusted if existing data in the table complies with the foreign key constraint. To set the foreign key to trusted, use the following script to trust the foreign key constraint again, noting the additional `WITH CHECK` syntax. Copy and paste the following example into the query window and select **Execute**.

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE [Purchasing].[PurchaseOrderHeader] 
    WITH CHECK 
    CHECK CONSTRAINT FK_PurchaseOrderHeader_Employee_EmployeeID;
    GO
    ```
