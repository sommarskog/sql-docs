# Dropping a SQL Server Native Client Index

  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider exposes the **IIndexDefinition::DropIndex** function. This allows consumers to remove an index from a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider exposes some [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints as indexes. The table owner, database owner, and some administrative role members can modify a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table, dropping a constraint. By default, only the table owner can drop an existing index. Therefore, **DropIndex** success or failure depends not only on the application user's access rights but also on the type of index indicated.  
  
 Consumers specify the table name as a Unicode character string in the *pwszName* member of the *uName* union in the *pTableID* parameter. The *eKind* member of *pTableID* must be DBKIND_NAME.  
  
 Consumers specify the index name as a Unicode character string in the *pwszName* member of the *uName* union in the *pIndexID* parameter. The *eKind* member of *pIndexID* must be DBKIND_NAME. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider does not support the OLE DB feature of dropping all indexes on a table when *pIndexID* is null. If *pIndexID* is null, E_INVALIDARG is returned.
