# Return Codes (Native Client OLE DB provider)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  At the most basic level, a member function either succeeds or fails. At a somewhat more precise level, a function can succeed, but its success may not be what the application developer intended.  
  
 For more information about OLE DB return codes, see [Return Codes (OLE DB)](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms725451(v=vs.85)).  
  
 When a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider member function returns S_OK, the function succeeded.  
  
 When a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider member function does not return S_OK, the OLE/COM HRESULT-unpacking FAILED and IS_ERROR macros can determine the overall success or failure of a function.  
  
 If FAILED or IS_ERROR returns TRUE, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider consumer is assured that member function execution failed. When FAILED or IS_ERROR return FALSE and the HRESULT does not equal S_OK, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider consumer is assured that the function succeeded in some sense. The consumer can retrieve detailed information on this "success with information" return from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider error interfaces. Also, in the case where a function clearly fails (the FAILED macro returns TRUE), extended error information is available from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider error interfaces.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider consumers commonly encounter the DB_S_ERRORSOCCURRED "success with information" HRESULT return. Typically, member functions that return DB_S_ERRORSOCCURRED define one or more parameters that deliver status values to the consumer. No error information may be available to the consumer other than that returned in status-value parameters, so consumers should implement application logic to retrieve status values when they are available.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider member functions do not return the success code S_FALSE. All [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider member functions always return S_OK to indicate success.
