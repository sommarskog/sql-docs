# Database recovery model best practice policy

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

For SQL Server Enterprise and Standard editions, this rule checks for non-read-only user databases that have recovery set to simple. For production databases, we recommend that you use the full recovery model instead of the simple recovery model. Full recovery mode enables point-in-time recovery. This approach helps reduce data loss if there's a disaster recovery.
  
## Best practices recommendations  

Production databases should be in full recovery mode. The transaction log should be backed up frequently to help ensure recoverability with minimum data loss.
