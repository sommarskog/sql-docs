# Verify Max Worker Threads Setting
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  This rule checks the max worker threads server option for potentially incorrect settings. Setting the max worker threads option to a small value may prevent enough threads from servicing incoming client requests in a timely manner and could lead to "thread starvation". However, setting the option to a large value can waste address space, because each active thread consumes up to 4 MB on 64-bit servers.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 Set the max worker threads option to 0. This enables [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to automatically determine the correct number of active worker threads based on user requests.
