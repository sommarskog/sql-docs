# Select Source Dialog Box
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  Use this dialog box to select the source of the policies to be run. To select one or more XML files that contain policies, select **Files**. To run the policies that are found on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], select **Server**.  
  
 You can open this dialog box in several ways.  
  
 **To open this dialog box**  
  
-   In Registered Servers, right-click **Local Server Groups** or any server under **Local Server Groups**, or any server under **Central Management Servers**, and then select **Evaluate Policies**. In the **Policy Selection** page of the **Evaluate Policies** dialog box, click the Browse (**...**) button.  
  
-   In Object Explorer, expand **Management**, expand **Policy Management**, right-click **Policies**, and select **Import Policy**. In the **Import** dialog box, click the Browse (**...**) button.  
  
-   In Object Explorer, right-click a server, database, or database object, select **Policies**, and then select **Evaluate**. In the **Policy Selection** page of the **Evaluate Policies** dialog box, click the Browse (**...**) button.  
  
## Options  
 **Files**  
 Select one or more XML files that contain policies.  
  
 **Server**  
 Enables you to select a server that contains the policies that you want to run.  
  
 **Server type**  
 Only [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] servers contain policies. This box is read-only.  
  
 **Server name**  
 Select the server instance to connect to. By default, the server instance last connected to is displayed.  
  
 **Authentication**  
 Two authentication modes are available when you connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
 **Windows Authentication Mode (Windows Authentication)**  
 Windows Authentication mode allows for a user to connect through a Windows user account.  
  
 **SQL Server Authentication**  
 When a user connects with a specified login name and password from a nontrusted connection, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] performs the authentication itself by checking whether a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login account has been set up and whether the specified password matches the one previously recorded. If [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not have a login account set, authentication fails, and the user receives an error message.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When possible, use Windows Authentication.  
  
 **User name**  
 Enter the user name to connect with. This option is available only if you have selected to connect by using Windows Authentication.  
  
 **Login**  
 Enter the login to connect with. This option is available only if you have selected to connect by using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.  
  
 **Password**  
 Enter the password for the login. This option is editable only if you have selected to connect by using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.
