#### To evaluate a policy from an object  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, right-click a server instance, a database, or a database object, point to **Policies**, and select **Evaluate**.  
  
2.  In the **Evaluate Policies** dialog box, select one or more policies and click **Evaluate** to run the policy in evaluation mode. This generates a compliance report for the target set but does not reconfigure [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or enforce future compliance. For targets that do not comply with the selected policies and have properties that can be reconfigured by Policy-Based Management, you can enforce policy compliance by clicking **Apply**. For more information on the available options in the **Evaluate Policies** dialog box, see [Evaluate Policies Dialog Box, Policy Selection Page](../../relational-databases/policy-based-management/evaluate-policies-dialog-box-policy-selection-page.md), [Evaluate Policies Dialog Box, Evaluation Results Page](../../relational-databases/policy-based-management/evaluate-policies-dialog-box-evaluation-results-page.md), and [Results Detailed View Dialog Box](../../relational-databases/policy-based-management/results-detailed-view-dialog-box.md).  
  
3.  When finished, click **Close**.
