# Fetching a Single Row with IRow (Native Client OLE DB Provider)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  The **IRow** interface implementation in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider is simplified to increase performance. **IRow** allows direct access to columns of a single row object. If you know beforehand that the result of a command execution will produce exactly one row, **IRow** will retrieve the columns of that row. If the result set includes multiple rows, **IRow** will expose only the first row.  
  
 The **IRow** implementation does not allow any navigation of the row. Each column in the row is accessed only one time with one exception: A column can be accessed one time to find the column size and again to fetch the data.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  **IRow::Open** supports only DBGUID_STREAM and DBGUID_NULL type of objects to be opened.  
  
 To obtain a row object using **ICommand::Execute** method, IID_IRow must be passed. The **IMultipleResults** interface must be used to handle multiple result sets. **IMultipleResults** supports **IRow** and **IRowset**. **IRowset** is used for bulk operations.
