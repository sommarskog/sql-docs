# Annotation Interpretation - Other Annotations
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb.md)]
  In addition to the annotations discussed in the previous topics in this section, XML Bulk Load interprets these other annotations, as follows:  
  
 **sql:id-prefix**  
 If the schema specifies prefixes to the XML data, XML Bulk Load removes the prefixes before sending the data to Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 **sql:use-cdata**  
 XML Bulk Load reads the text that is stored in the CDATA sections and sends it to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 **sql:url-encode**  
 XML Bulk Load does not support this annotation. For example, you cannot specify a URL in the XML data input and expect XML Bulk Load to read data from that location to store it in the database.  
  
 **sql:is-mapping-schema**  
 XML Bulk Load does not support this annotation, nor does it support **sql:id**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  XML Bulk Load does not support inline mapping schemas.  
  
 **sql:key-fields**  
 XML Bulk Load always ignores this annotation.
