# Administer multiple servers using Central Management Servers
[!INCLUDE[sqlserver](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  You can administer multiple servers by designating Central Management Servers and creating server groups.  
  
## What is a Central Management Server and server groups?  
 An instance of SQL Server designated as a Central Management Server maintains server groups that contain the connection information for one or more instances. You can execute [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements and Policy-Based Management policies at the same time against server groups. You can also view the log files on instances managed through a Central Management Server. 
 
 Basically, a Central Management Server is a central repository containing a list of your managed servers. Versions earlier than [!INCLUDE[sql2008-md](../includes/sql2008-md.md)] cannot be designated as a Central Management Server.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements can also be executed against local server groups in Registered Servers.  
  
## Create Central Management Server and server groups 
 To create a Central Management Server and server groups, use the **Registered Servers** window in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. Note that the Central Management Server should not be a member of a group that it maintains, to prevent accidental audit policy application that could interfere with the CMS itself. SSMS enforces this by preventing a server of the same name as the Central Management Server from being added to a group.

 Central Management Servers are [also available in Azure Data Studio](../azure-data-studio/extensions/sql-server-cms-extension.md).
 
 For how to create Central Management Servers and server groups, see [Create a Central Management Server and Server Group &#40;SQL Server Management Studio&#41;](../ssms/register-servers/create-a-central-management-server-and-server-group.md).
