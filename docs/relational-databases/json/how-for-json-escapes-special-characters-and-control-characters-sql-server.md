# How FOR JSON escapes special characters and control characters (SQL Server)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

This article describes how the `FOR JSON` clause of a SQL Server `SELECT` statement escapes special characters and represents control characters in the JSON output.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the built-in support for JSON in Microsoft SQL Server. For general information about escaping and encoding in JSON, see Section 2.5 of the [JSON RFC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt).

## Escape of special characters

If the source data contains special characters, the `FOR JSON` clause escapes them in the JSON output with `\`, as shown in the following table. This escaping occurs both in the names of properties and in their values.

| Special character | Escaped output |
| --- | --- |
| Quotation mark (`"`) | `\"` |
| Backslash (`\`) | `\\`|
| Slash (`/`) | `\/` |
| Backspace | `\b` |
| Form feed | `\f` |
| New line | `\n` |
| Carriage return | `\r` |
| Horizontal tab | `\t` |

## Control characters

If the source data contains control characters, the `FOR JSON` clause encodes them in the JSON output in `\u<code>` format, as shown in the following table.

| **Control character** | **Encoded output** |
| --- | --- |
| **CHAR(0)** | `\u0000` |
| **CHAR(1)** | `\u0001` |
| ... | ... |
| **CHAR(31)** | `\u001f` |

## Example

Here's an example of the `FOR JSON` output for source data that includes both special characters and control characters.

Query:

```sql
SELECT 'VALUE\    /
  "' AS [KEY\/"],
    CHAR(0) AS '0',
    CHAR(1) AS '1',
    CHAR(31) AS '31'
FOR JSON PATH;
```

Result:

```json
[
    {
        "KEY\\\/\"": "VALUE\\    \/\r\n  \"",
        "0": "\u0000",
        "1": "\u0001",
        "31": "\u001f"
    }
]
```
