# Configure and Manage Filters for Search
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb.md)]
  Indexing documents in a **varbinary**, **varbinary(max)**, **image**, or **xml** data type column requires extra processing. This processing must be performed by a filter. The filter extracts the textual information from the document (removing the formatting). The filter then sends the text to the word-breaker component for the language associated with the table column.  
 
## Filters and document types
A given filter is specific to a given document type (.doc, .pdf, .xls, .xml, and so forth). These filters implement the IFilter interface. For more information about these document types, query the [sys.fulltext_document_types](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-fulltext-document-types-transact-sql.md) catalog view.  
  
Binary documents can be stored in a single **varbinary(max)** or **image** column. For each document, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] chooses the correct filter based on the file extension. Because the file extension is not visible when the file is stored in a **varbinary(max)** or **image** column, the file extension (.doc, .xls,  .pdf, and so forth) must be stored in a separate column in the table, called a type column. This type column can be of any character-based data type and contains the document file extension, such as .doc for a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Word document. In the **Document** table in [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoShort](../../includes/sssampledbcoshort-md.md)], the **Document** column is of type **varbinary(max)**, and the type column, **FileExtension**, is of type **nvarchar(8)**.  

**To view the type column in an existing full-text index**  
  
-   [sys.fulltext_index_columns &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-fulltext-index-columns-transact-sql.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  A filter might be able to handle objects embedded in the parent object, depending on its implementation. However, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not configure filters to follow links to other objects.  

## Installed filters 
[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installs its own XML and HTML filters. In addition, any filters for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] proprietary formats (.doc, .xdoc, .ppt, and so on) that are already installed on the operating system are also loaded by  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. To identify the filters that are currently loaded on an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], use the [sp_help_fulltext_system_components](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-help-fulltext-system-components-transact-sql.md) stored procedure, as follows:  

```sql
EXEC sp_help_fulltext_system_components 'filter';   
```  

> [!NOTE]
> Even with the latest version of the Office Filter Pack that provides .xlsx support, SQL Server does not support Strict Open XML Spreadsheets.  No error will be returned, SQL Server will simply fail to index the contents of any Strict Open XML Spreadsheets.

## Non-Microsoft filters
Before you can use filters for non- [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] formats, however, you must manually load them into the server instance. For information about installing additional filters, see [View or Change Registered Filters and Word Breakers](../../relational-databases/search/view-or-change-registered-filters-and-word-breakers.md).
