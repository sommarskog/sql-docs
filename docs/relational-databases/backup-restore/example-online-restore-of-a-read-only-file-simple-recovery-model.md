# Example: Online Restore of a Read-Only File (Simple Recovery Model)
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  This topic is relevant for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] databases under the simple recovery model that contain a read-only filegroup. Under the simple recovery model, a read-only file can be restored online if a file backup exists that was taken since the file became read-only for the last time.  
  
 In this example, a database named `adb` contains three filegroups. Filegroup `A` is read/write, and filegroups `B` and `C` are read-only. Initially, all of the filegroups are online. A read-only file in filegroup `B`, `b1`, has to be restored. The database administrator can restore it by using a backup that was taken after the file became read-only. For the duration of the restore, filegroup `B` will be offline, but the remainder of the database will remain online.  
  
## Restore Sequence  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The syntax for an online restore sequence is the same as for an offline restore sequence.  
  
 To restore the file, the database administrator uses the following restore sequence:  
  
```  
RESTORE DATABASE adb FILE='b1' FROM filegroup_B_backup   
WITH RECOVERY  
```  
  
 The file is now online.
