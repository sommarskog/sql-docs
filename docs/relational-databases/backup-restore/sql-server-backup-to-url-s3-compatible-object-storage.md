# SQL Server backup to URL for S3-compatible object storage

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2022](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2022.md)]

This article introduces the concepts, requirements and components necessary to [use S3-compatible object storage as a backup destination](sql-server-backup-and-restore-with-s3-compatible-object-storage.md). The backup and restore functionality is conceptually similar to working with [SQL Server backup to URL for Azure Blob Storage](sql-server-backup-to-url.md) as a backup device type.

For information on supported platforms, see [providers of S3-compatible object storage](sql-server-backup-and-restore-with-s3-compatible-object-storage.md#providers-of-s3-compatible-object-storage).

## Overview

[!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] introduces object storage integration to the data platform, enabling you to integrate SQL Server with S3-compatible object storage in addition to Azure Storage. To provide this integration SQL Server has been enhanced with a new S3 connector, which uses the S3 REST API to connect to any provider of S3-compatible object storage. [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] extends the existing BACKUP/RESTORE TO/FROM URL syntax by adding support for the new S3 connector using the REST API.

URLs pointing to S3-compatible resources are prefixed with `s3://` to denote that the S3 connector is being used. URLs beginning with `s3://` always assume that the underlying protocol is `https`.

## Part numbers and file size limitations

To store data, the S3-compatible object storage provider must split files in multiple blocks called parts. This is similar to [block blobs](/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs) in Azure Blob Storage.

Each file can be split up to 10,000 parts, each part size ranges from 5 MB to 20 MB, this range is controlled by the T-SQL BACKUP command through the parameter [MAXTRANSFERSIZE](../../t-sql/statements/backup-transact-sql.md#with-options). The default value of `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` is 10 MB, therefore the default size of each part is 10 MB.

The maximum supported size of a single file is the result of *10,000 parts \* `MAXTRANSFERSIZE`*, if it is required to backup a bigger file it must split/striped up to 64 URLs. The final maximum supported size of a file is *10,000 parts \* `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` \* URLs*.

> [!NOTE]  
> The use of COMPRESSION is required in order to change `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` values.

## Prerequisites for the S3 endpoint

The S3 endpoint must have been configured as follows:

- TLS must be configured. It is assumed that all connections will be securely transmitted over HTTPS not HTTP. The endpoint is validated by a certificate installed on the SQL Server OS Host.
- Credentials created on the S3-compatible object storage with proper permissions to perform the operation. The user and password created on the storage layer are named the `Access Key ID` and `Secret Key ID`. You need both to authenticate against the S3 endpoint.
- At least one bucket has been configured. Buckets cannot be created or configured from [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)].

## Security

### Backup Permissions

To connect SQL Server to S3-compatible object storage, two sets of permissions need to be established, one on SQL Server and also on the storage layer.

On SQL Server the user account that is used to issue BACKUP or RESTORE commands should be in the **db_backupoperator** database role with **Alter any credential** permissions.

On the storage layer, the user (`Access Key ID`) must have both **ListBucket** and **WriteOnly** permissions.

### Restore Permissions

If the database being restored does not exist, the user must have `CREATE DATABASE` permissions to be able to execute RESTORE. If the database exists, RESTORE permissions default to members of the `sysadmin` and `dbcreator` fixed server roles and the owner (`dbo`) of the database.

RESTORE permissions are given to roles in which membership information is always readily available to the server. Because fixed database role membership can be checked only when the database is accessible and undamaged, which is not always the case when RESTORE is executed, members of the `db_owner` fixed database role do not have RESTORE permissions.

On the storage layer, the user (`Access Key ID`) must have both **ListBucket** and **ReadOnly** permissions.

## Supported features

High-level overview of the supported features for `BACKUP` and `RESTORE`:

1. A single backup file can be up to 200,000 MiB per URL (with `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` set to 20 MB).
1. Backups can be striped across a maximum of 64 URLs.
1. Mirroring is supported, but only across URLs. Mirroring using both URL and DISK is not supported.
1. Compression is supported and recommended.
1. Encryption is supported.
1. Restore from URL with S3-compatible object storage has no size limitation.
1. When you are restoring a database, the `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` is determined by value assigned during the backup phase.
1. URLs can be specified either in virtual host or path style format.
1. `WITH CREDENTIAL` is supported.
1. `REGION` is supported and the default value is `us-east-1`.
1. `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` ranges from 5 MB to 20 MB. 10 MB is the default value for the S3 connector.

### Region

Your S3-compatible object storage provider can offer the ability to determine a specific region for the bucket location. The use of this optional parameter can provide more flexibility by specifying which region that particular bucket belongs to. This parameter requires the use of `WITH` together with either `BACKUP_OPTIONS` or `RESTORE_OPTIONS`. These options require the value to be declared in JSON format. This allows scenarios in which an S3-compatible storage provider can have the same universal URL but be distributed across several regions. In this case, the backup or restore command will point to the specified regions without the need to change the URL.

If no value is declared, `us-east-1` is assigned as default.

Backup example:

```sql
WITH
    BACKUP_OPTIONS = '{"s3": {"region":"us-west-1"}}'
```

Restore example:

```sql
WITH
    RESTORE_OPTIONS = '{"s3": {"region":"us-west-1"}}'
```

### Linux support

SQL Server uses `WinHttp` to implement client of HTTP REST APIs it uses. It relies on OS certificate store for validations of the TLS certificates being presented by HTTP(s) endpoint. However, SQL Server on Linux the CA must be placed on a predefined location to be created at `/var/opt/mssql/security/ca-certificates`, only the first 50 certificates can be stored and supported in this folder.

SQL Server reads the certificates from the folder during startup and adds them to the trust store.

Only super user should be able to write in the folder, while the `mssql` user must be able to read.

## Unsupported features

- Backup to S3-compatible object storage with a nonsecure HTTP URL is not supported. Customers are responsible for setting up their S3 host with an HTTPS URL and this endpoint is validated by a certificate installed on the SQL Server OS host.
- Backup to S3-compatible object storage is not supported in SQL Server Express and SQL Server Express with Advanced Services editions.

## Limitations

The following are the current limitations of backup and restore with S3-compatible object storage:

1. Due to the current limitation of S3 Standard REST API, the temporary uncommitted data files that are created in the customer's S3-compatible object store (due to an ongoing multipart upload operation) while the BACKUP T-SQL command is running, are not removed in case of failures. These uncommitted data blocks continue to persist in S3-compatible object storage in the case the BACKUP T-SQL command fails or is canceled. If the backup succeeds, these temporary files are automatically removed by the object store to form the final backup file. Some S3-compatible storage providers handle this through their garbage collector system.
1. The total URL length is limited to 259 characters. The full string is counted in this limitation, including the `s3://` connector name. So, the usable limit is 254 characters. However, we recommend sticking to a limit of 200 characters to allow for possible introduction of query parameters.
1. The SQL credential name is limited by 128 characters in UTF-16 format.
1. Secret key ID must not have `:` character.

### Path style and virtual host style

Backup to S3 supports the URL to be written in both path style or virtual host style.

Path style example: `s3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/<backup_file_name>`

Virtual host example: `s3://<bucket>.<domain>/<backup_file_name>`

## Examples

### Create credential

<!-- The name of the credential must include the bucket name. -->
- The IDENTITY should always be `'S3 Access Key'` when using the S3 connector.
- The Access Key ID and Secret Key ID must not contain a colon. Access Key ID and Secret Key ID is the user and password created on the S3-compatible object storage.
- Only alphanumeric values are allowed.
- The Access Key ID must have proper permissions on the S3-compatible object storage.

The following examples create SQL Server credentials for authentication with the object storage endpoint:

```sql
CREATE CREDENTIAL   [s3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>]
WITH
        IDENTITY    = 'S3 Access Key',
        SECRET      = '<AccessKeyID>:<SecretKeyID>';
```

### Backup to URL

The following example performs a full database backup to the object storage endpoint, striped across multiple files:

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE <db_name>
TO      URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/<database>_01.bak'
,       URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/<database>_02.bak'
,       URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/<database>_03.bak'
--
,       URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/<database>_64.bak'
WITH    FORMAT -- overwrite
,       STATS               = 10
,       COMPRESSION;
```

### Restore from URL

The following example performs a database restore from the object storage endpoint location:

```sql
RESTORE DATABASE <db_name>
FROM    URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/<database>_01.bak'
,       URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/<database>_02.bak'
,       URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/<database>_03.bak'
--
,       URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/<database>_64.bak'
WITH    REPLACE -- overwrite
,       STATS  = 10;
```

### Options for encryption and compression

The following example shows how to back up and restore the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database with encryption, `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` as 20 MB and compression:

```sql
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = <password>;
GO

CREATE CERTIFICATE AdventureWorks2022Cert
    WITH SUBJECT = 'AdventureWorks2022 Backup Certificate';
GO
-- Backup database
BACKUP DATABASE AdventureWorks2022
TO URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/AdventureWorks2022_Encrypt.bak'
WITH FORMAT, MAXTRANSFERSIZE = 20971520, COMPRESSION,
ENCRYPTION (ALGORITHM = AES_256, SERVER CERTIFICATE = AdventureWorks2022Cert)
GO

-- Restore database
RESTORE DATABASE AdventureWorks2022
FROM URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/AdventureWorks2022_Encrypt.bak'
WITH REPLACE
```

### Use region for backup and restore

The following example shows how to back up and restore the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database using `REGION_OPTIONS`:

```sql
-- Backup Database
BACKUP DATABASE AdventureWorks2022
TO URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/AdventureWorks2022.bak'
WITH BACKUP_OPTIONS = '{"s3": {"region":"us-east-1"}}'

-- Restore Database
RESTORE DATABASE AdventureWorks2022
FROM URL = 's3://<endpoint>:<port>/<bucket>/AdventureWorks2022.bak'
WITH MOVE 'AdventureWorks2022' TO 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\AdventureWorks2022.mdf'
, MOVE 'AdventureWorks2022_log' TO 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\AdventureWorks2022.ldf'
, RESTORE_OPTIONS = '{"s3": {"region":"us-east-1"}}'
```
