# IServerVirtualDevice::CloseDevice (VDI)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

The **CloseDevice** function closes a virtual device that had been opened with IServerVirtualDeviceSet2::OpenDevice

## Syntax

```c
HRESULT IServerVirtualDevice::CloseDevice ();
```

## Return Value

|Return Value | Explanation |
|---|---|
| VD_E_CLOSE | The device is already closed. |
| VD_E_ABORT | The interface is in the Abort state. |

## Remarks

CloseDevice is not required after SignalAbort is used to force abnormal termination. If CloseDevice is invoked after SignalAbort is used, no action is taken.
