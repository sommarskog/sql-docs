The **GetConfiguration** function obtains the configuration requested by the client.

## Syntax

```c
HRESULT IServerVirtualDeviceSet2::GetConfiguration (
   VDConfig*   pCfg
);
```

## Parameters

*pCfg*
This is the configuration specified by the client using IClientVirtualDeviceSet2::Create.

## Return Value

Returns an *HRESULT* indicating success or failure of the method call. A value of NOERROR indicates that the method call was successful. A non-zero value indicates that an error has occurred.
