### To restart an interrupted restore operation

    -   The same clauses used in the original RESTORE statement.

-- Restore a full database backup of the AdventureWorks database.  
RESTORE DATABASE AdventureWorks  
   FROM DISK = 'C:\AdventureWorks.bck'  
GO  
-- The restore operation halted prematurely.  
-- Repeat the original RESTORE statement specifying WITH RESTART.  
RESTORE DATABASE AdventureWorks   
   FROM DISK = 'C:\AdventureWorks.bck'  
   WITH RESTART  
GO  
```
