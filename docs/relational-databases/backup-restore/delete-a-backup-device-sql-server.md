# Delete a Backup Device (SQL Server)
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  This topic describes how to delete a backup device in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].

#### To delete a backup device  
  
1.  After connecting to the appropriate instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], in Object Explorer, click the server name to expand the server tree.  
  
2.  Expand **Server Objects**, and then expand **Backup Devices**.  
  
3.  Right-click the device you want, and then click **Delete**.  
  
4.  In the **Delete Object** dialog box, verify that the correct device name appears in the **Object Name** column.  
  
5.  Click **OK**.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To delete a backup device  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query. This example shows how to use [sp_dropdevice](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-dropdevice-transact-sql.md) to delete a backup device. Execute the first example to create the `mybackupdisk` backup device and the physical name `c:\backup\backup1.bak`. Execute **sp_dropdevice** to delete the `mybackupdisk` backup device. The `delfile` parameter deletes the physical name.  
  
```sql  
--Define a backup device and physical name.   
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
GO  
EXEC sp_addumpdevice 'disk', 'mybackupdisk', 'c:\backup\backup1.bak' ;  
GO  
--Delete the backup device and the physical name.  
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
GO  
EXEC sp_dropdevice ' mybackupdisk ', 'delfile' ;  
GO  
  
```
