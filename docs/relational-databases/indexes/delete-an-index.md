##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
 Indexes created as the result of a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint cannot be deleted by using this method. Instead, the constraint must be deleted. To remove the constraint and corresponding index, use [ALTER TABLE](../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md) with the DROP CONSTRAINT clause in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. For more information, see [Delete Primary Keys](../../relational-databases/tables/delete-primary-keys.md).  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Requires ALTER permission on the table or view. This permission is granted by default to the **sysadmin** fixed server role and the **db_ddladmin** and **db_owner** fixed database roles.

2.  Expand the **Tables** folder.  
  
3.  Expand the table that contains the index you want to delete.  
  
4.  Expand the **Indexes** folder.  
  
5.  Right-click the index you want to delete and select **Delete**.  
  
6.  In the **Delete Object** dialog box, verify that the correct index is in the **Object to be deleted** grid and click **OK**.  
  
#### To delete an index using Table Designer  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, expand the database that contains the table on which you want to delete an index.  
  
2.  Expand the **Tables** folder.  
  
3.  Right-click the table that contains the index you want to delete and click Design.  
  
4.  On the **Table Designer** menu, click **Indexes/Keys**.  
  
5.  In the **Indexes/Keys** dialog box, select the index you want to delete.  
  
6.  Click **Delete**.  
  
7.  Click **Close**.

##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To delete an index  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    USE AdventureWorks2022;  
    GO  
    -- delete the IX_ProductVendor_BusinessEntityID index  
    -- from the Purchasing.ProductVendor table  
    DROP INDEX IX_ProductVendor_BusinessEntityID   
        ON Purchasing.ProductVendor;  
    GO  
    ```
