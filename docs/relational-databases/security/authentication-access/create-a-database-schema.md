# Create a database schema

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]
  This article describes how to create a schema in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)].
  
## <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
- The new schema is owned by one of the following database-level principals: database user, database role, or application role. Objects created within a schema are owned by the owner of the schema, and have a NULL **principal_id** in **sys.objects**. Ownership of schema-contained objects can be transferred to any database-level principal, but the schema owner always retains CONTROL permission on objects within the schema.  
  
- When creating a database object, if you specify a valid domain principal (user or group) as the object owner, the domain principal is added to the database as a schema. The new schema is owned by that domain principal.  
  
## <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
  
- Requires CREATE SCHEMA permission on the database.  
  
- To specify another user as the owner of the schema being created, the caller must have IMPERSONATE permission on that user. If a database role is specified as the owner, the caller must meet one of the following criteria: membership in the role or ALTER permission on the role.  
  
## <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio to create a schema 
  
1. In Object Explorer, expand the **Databases** folder.  
  
2. Expand the database in which to create the new database schema.  
  
3. Right-click the **Security** folder, point to **New**, and select **Schema**.  
  
4. In the **Schema - New** dialog box, on the **General** page, enter a name for the new schema in the **Schema name** box.  
  
5. In the **Schema owner** box, enter the name of a database user or role to own the schema. Alternately, select **Search** to open the **Search Roles and Users** dialog box.  
  
6. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> A dialog box will not appear if you are creating a Schema using SSMS against an **Azure SQL Database** or an **Azure Synapse Analytics**. You will need to run the Create Schema Template T-SQL Statement that is generated.
  
### Additional Options

The **Schema - New** dialog box also offers options on two additional pages: **Permissions** and **Extended Properties**.  
  
- The **Permissions** page lists all possible securables and the permissions on those securables that can be granted to the login.  
  
- The **Extended properties** page allows you to add custom properties to database users.  
  
## <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using transact-SQL to create a schema
  
1. In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2. On the Standard bar, select **New Query**.  
  
3. The following example creates a schema named `Chains`, and then creates a table named `Sizes`.

   ```sql  
   CREATE SCHEMA Chains;
   GO
   CREATE TABLE Chains.Sizes (ChainID int, width dec(10,2));
   ```

4. Additional options can be performed in a single statement. The following example creates the schema `Sprockets` owned by `Joe` that contains the table `NineProngs`. The statement grants `SELECT` to `Bob` and denies `SELECT` to `John`.  

   ```sql  
   CREATE SCHEMA Sprockets AUTHORIZATION Joe  
       CREATE TABLE NineProngs (source int, cost int, partnumber int)  
       GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA::Sprockets TO Bob  
       DENY SELECT ON SCHEMA::Sprockets TO John;  
   GO  
   ```

5. Execute the following statement to view the schemas in the current database:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.schemas;
   ```
