# Server-level roles

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Managed Instance Parallel Data Warehouse](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides server-level roles to help you manage the permissions on a server. These roles are security principals that group other principals. Server-level roles are server-wide in their permissions scope. (*Roles* are like *groups* in the Windows operating system.)

SQL Server 2019 and previous versions provided nine fixed server roles. The permissions that are granted to the fixed server roles (except **public**) can't be changed. Beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], you can create user-defined server roles and add server-level permissions to the user-defined server roles.
[!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] comes with 10 additional server roles that have been designed specifically with the [*Principle of Least Privilege*](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sql-blog/security-the-principle-of-least-privilege-polp/ba-p/2067390) in mind, which have the prefix `##MS_` and the suffix `##` to distinguish them from other regular user-created principals and custom server roles. Those new roles contain privileges that apply on server scope but also can inherit down to individual databases (except for the **##MS_LoginManager##** server role.)

Like SQL Server on-premises, server permissions are organized hierarchically. The permissions that are held by these server-level roles can propagate to database permissions. For the permissions to be effectively useful at the database level, a login needs to either be a member of the server-level role **##MS_DatabaseConnector##** (starting with [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../../includes/sssql22-md.md)]), which grants the **CONNECT** permission to all databases, or have a user account in individual databases. This also applies to the `master` database.
Consider the following example: The server-level role **##MS_ServerStateReader##** holds the permission **VIEW SERVER STATE**. A login who is member of this role has a user account in the databases, `master` and `WideWorldImporters`. This user will then also have the permission, **VIEW DATABASE STATE** in those two databases by inheritance.

You can add server-level principals ([!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] logins, Windows accounts, and Windows groups) into server-level roles. Each member of a fixed server role can add other logins to that same role. Members of user-defined server roles can't add other server principals to the role.

## Fixed server-level roles

> [!NOTE]  
> These server-level roles introduced prior to [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] are not available in Azure SQL Database or Azure Synapse Analytics. There are special [Azure SQL Database server roles for permission management](/azure/azure-sql/database/security-server-roles) that are equivalent to the server-level roles introduced in [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../../includes/sssql22-md.md)]. For more information about SQL Database, see [Controlling and granting database access.](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-manage-logins).

The following table shows the fixed server-level roles and their capabilities.

| Fixed server-level role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **sysadmin** | Members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can perform any activity in the server. |
| **serveradmin** | Members of the **serveradmin** fixed server role can change server-wide configuration options and shut down the server. |
| **securityadmin** | Members of the **securityadmin** fixed server role manage logins and their properties. They can `GRANT`, `DENY`, and `REVOKE` server-level permissions. They can also `GRANT`, `DENY`, and `REVOKE` database-level permissions if they have access to a database. Additionally, they can reset passwords for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] logins.<br /><br />**IMPORTANT:** The ability to grant access to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../includes/ssde-md.md)] and to configure user permissions allows the security admin to assign most server permissions. The **securityadmin** role should be treated as equivalent to the **sysadmin** role. As an alternative, starting with [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../../includes/sssql22-md.md)], consider using the new fixed server role **##MS_LoginManager##**. |
| **processadmin** | Members of the **processadmin** fixed server role can end processes that are running in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. |
| **setupadmin** | Members of the **setupadmin** fixed server role can add and remove linked servers by using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements. (**sysadmin** membership is needed when using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)].) |
| **bulkadmin** | Members of the **bulkadmin** fixed server role can run the `BULK INSERT` statement.<br /><br />The **bulkadmin** role or ADMINISTER BULK OPERATIONS permissions isn't supported for SQL Server on Linux. Only the **sysadmin** can perform bulk inserts for SQL Server on Linux. |
| **diskadmin** | The **diskadmin** fixed server role is used for managing disk files. |
| **dbcreator** | Members of the **dbcreator** fixed server role can create, alter, drop, and restore any database. |
| **public** | Every [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login belongs to the **public** server role. When a server principal hasn't been granted or denied specific permissions on a securable object, the user inherits the permissions granted to **public** on that object. Only assign public permissions on any object when you want the object to be available to all users. You can't change membership in public.<br /><br />**Note:** **public** is implemented differently than other roles, and permissions can be granted, denied, or revoked from the public fixed server roles. |

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Most of the permissions provided by the following server roles are not applicable to Azure Synapse Analytics - **processadmin**, **serveradmin**, **setupadmin**, and **diskadmin**.

## Fixed server-level roles introduced in SQL Server 2022

The following table shows additional fixed server-level roles that are introduced with [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] and their capabilities.

> [!NOTE]  
> These server-level permissions are not available for Azure SQL Managed Instance or Azure Synapse Analytics. **##MS_PerformanceDefinitionReader##**, **##MS_ServerPerformanceStateReader##**, and **##MS_ServerSecurityStateReader##** is introduced in [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../../includes/sssql22-md.md)], and are not available in Azure SQL Database.

| Fixed server-level role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **##MS_DatabaseConnector##** | Members of the **##MS_DatabaseConnector##** fixed server role can connect to any database without requiring a User-account in the database to connect to.<br /><br />To deny the **CONNECT** permission to a specific database, users can create a matching user account for this login in the database and then **DENY** the **CONNECT** permission to the database-user. This **DENY** permission will overrule the **GRANT CONNECT** permission coming from this role. |
| **##MS_LoginManager##** | Members of the **##MS_LoginManager##** fixed server role can create, delete and modify logins. Contrary to the old fixed server role **securityadmin**, this role doesn't allow members to `GRANT` privileges. It is a more limited role that helps to comply with the *Principle of least Privilege*. |
| **##MS_DatabaseManager##** | Members of the **##MS_DatabaseManager##** fixed server role can create and delete databases. A member of the **##MS_DatabaseManager##** role that creates a database, becomes the owner of that database, which allows that user to connect to that database as the `dbo` user. The `dbo` user has all database permissions in the database. Members of the **##MS_DatabaseManager##** role don't necessarily have permission to access databases that they don't own. This server role has the same privileges as the dbcreator role in SQL Server, but we recommend using this new role over the former, since this role exists also in Azure SQL Database and thus helps using the same scripts accross different environments. |
| **##MS_ServerStateManager##** | Members of the **##MS_ServerStateManager##** fixed server role have the same permissions as the **##MS_ServerStateReader##** role. Also, it holds the **ALTER SERVER STATE** permission, which allows access to several management operations, such as: `DBCC FREEPROCCACHE`, `DBCC FREESYSTEMCACHE ('ALL')`, `DBCC SQLPERF()` |
| **##MS_ServerStateReader##** | Members of the **##MS_ServerStateReader##** fixed server role can read all dynamic management views (DMVs) and functions that are covered by **VIEW SERVER STATE**, and respectively has **VIEW DATABASE STATE** permission on any database on which the member of this role has a user account. |
| **##MS_ServerPerformanceStateReader##** | Members of the **##MS_ServerPerformanceStateReader##** fixed server role can read all dynamic management views (DMVs) and functions that are covered by **VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE**, and respectively has **VIEW DATABASE PERFORMANCE STATE** permission on any database on which the member of this role has a user account. This is a subset of what the **##MS_ServerStateReader##** server role has access to which helps to comply with the *Principle of least Privilege*. |
| **##MS_ServerSecurityStateReader##** | Members of the **##MS_ServerSecurityStateReader##** fixed server role can read all dynamic management views (DMVs) and functions that are covered by **VIEW SERVER SECURITY STATE**, and respectively has **VIEW DATABASE SECURITY STATE** permission on any database on which the member of this role has a user account. This is a small subset of what the **##MS_ServerStateReader##** server role has access to, which helps to comply with the *Principle of least Privilege*. |
| **##MS_DefinitionReader##** | Members of the **##MS_DefinitionReader##** fixed server role can read all catalog views that are covered by **VIEW ANY DEFINITION**, and respectively has **VIEW DEFINITION** permission on any database on which the member of this role has a user account. |
| **##MS_PerformanceDefinitionReader##** | Members of the **##MS_PerformanceDefinitionReader##** fixed server role can read all catalog views that are covered by **VIEW ANY PERFORMANCE DEFINITION**, and respectively has **VIEW PERFORMANCE DEFINITION** permission on any database on which the member of this role has a user account. This is a subset of what the **##MS_DefinitionReader##** server role has access to. |
| **##MS_SecurityDefinitionReader##** | Members of the **##MS_SecurityDefinitionReader##** fixed server role can read all catalog views that are covered by **VIEW ANY SECURITY DEFINITION**, and respectively has **VIEW SECURITY DEFINITION** permission on any database on which the member of this role has a user account. This is a small subset of what the **##MS_DefinitionReader##** server role has access to which helps to comply with the *Principle of least Privilege*. |

## Permissions of fixed server roles

Each fixed server role has certain permissions assigned to it.

### Permissions of new fixed server roles in SQL Server 2022

The following table shows the permissions assigned to the server-level roles. It also shows the  database-level permissions that are inherited as long as the user can connect to individual databases.

| Fixed server-level role | Server-level permissions | Database-level permissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **##MS_DatabaseConnector##** | CONNECT ANY DATABASE | CONNECT |
| **##MS_LoginManager##** | CREATE LOGIN<br />ALTER ANY LOGIN | N/A |
| **##MS_DatabaseManager##** | CREATE ANY DATABASE<br />ALTER ANY DATABASE | ALTER |
| **##MS_ServerStateManager##** | ALTER SERVER STATE<br />VIEW SERVER STATE<br />VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE<br />VIEW SERVER SECURITY STATE | VIEW DATABASE STATE<br />VIEW DATABASE PERFORMANCE STATE<br />VIEW DATABASE SECURITY STATE |
| **##MS_ServerStateReader##** | VIEW SERVER STATE<br />VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE<br />VIEW SERVER SECURITY STATE | VIEW DATABASE STATE<br />VIEW DATABASE PERFORMANCE STATE<br />VIEW DATABASE SECURITY STATE |
| **##MS_ServerPerformanceStateReader##** | VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE | VIEW DATABASE PERFORMANCE STATE |
| **##MS_ServerSecurityStateReader##** | VIEW SERVER SECURITY STATE | VIEW DATABASE SECURITY STATE |
| **##MS_DefinitionReader##** | VIEW ANY DATABASE<br />VIEW ANY DEFINITION<br />VIEW ANY PERFORMANCE DEFINITION<br />VIEW ANY SECURITY DEFINITION | VIEW DEFINITION<br />VIEW PERFORMANCE DEFINITION<br />VIEW SECURITY DEFINITION |
| **##MS_PerformanceDefinitionReader##** | VIEW ANY PERFORMANCE DEFINITION | VIEW PERFORMANCE DEFINITION |
| **##MS_SecurityDefinitionReader##** | VIEW ANY SECURITY DEFINITION | VIEW SECURITY DEFINITION |

### Permissions of server roles for SQL Server 2019 and earlier

The following graphic shows the permissions assigned to the legacy server roles (SQL Server 2019 and earlier versions).  
:::image type="content" source="media/server-level-roles/permissions-of-server-roles.png" alt-text="Diagram showing fixed server role permissions.":::

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **CONTROL SERVER** permission is similar but not identical to the **sysadmin** fixed server role. Permissions do not imply role memberships and role memberships do not grant permissions. (E.g. **CONTROL SERVER** does not imply membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.) However, it is sometimes possible to impersonate between roles and equivalent permissions. Most **DBCC** commands and many system procedures require membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.

## Server-level permissions

Only server-level permissions can be added to user-defined server roles. To list the server-level permissions, execute the following statement. The server-level permissions are:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.fn_builtin_permissions('SERVER') ORDER BY permission_name;
```

For more information about permissions, see [Permissions (Database Engine)](../../../relational-databases/security/permissions-database-engine.md) and [sys.fn_builtin_permissions (Transact-SQL)](../../../relational-databases/system-functions/sys-fn-builtin-permissions-transact-sql.md).
