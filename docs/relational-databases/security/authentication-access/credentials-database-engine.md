# Credentials (Database Engine)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  A credential is a record that contains the authentication information (credentials) required to connect to a resource outside [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This information is used internally by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Most credentials contain a Windows user name and password.  
  
 The information stored in a credential enables a user who has connected to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by way of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication to access resources outside the server instance. When the external resource is Windows, the user is authenticated as the Windows user specified in the credential. A single credential can only be mapped to a single [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login. And a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login can be mapped to only one credential.  
  
 For credentials that are stored in the master database and can be used throughout the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [CREATE CREDENTIAL &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../t-sql/statements/create-credential-transact-sql.md). For credentials used by a specific database, and portable with that database, see [CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../t-sql/statements/create-database-scoped-credential-transact-sql.md).  
  
 System credentials are created automatically and are associated with specific endpoints. Names for system credentials start with two hash signs (##).  
  
 For more information about credentials, see the [sys.credentials](../../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-credentials-transact-sql.md) and [sys.database_scoped_credentials](../../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-database-scoped-credentials-transact-sql.md) catalog views.
