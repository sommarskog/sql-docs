# Azure Active Directory authentication for SQL Server

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2022](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2022.md)]

[!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] introduces support for [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication](/azure/active-directory/authentication/overview-authentication), on both Windows and Linux on-premises, and [SQL Server on Windows Azure VMs](/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/security-considerations-best-practices#azure-ad-authentication-preview).

## Overview

You can now connect to SQL Server using the following authentication methods using Azure AD identities:

- Azure Active Directory Password
- Azure Active Directory Integrated
- Azure Active Directory Universal with Multi-Factor Authentication
- Azure Active Directory Service Principal
- Azure Active Directory Managed Identity
- Azure Active Directory Default
- Azure Active Directory access token

The current authentication modes, such as [SQL authentication and Windows authentication](../choose-an-authentication-mode.md) remain unchanged.

As a central authentication repository used by Azure, Azure AD allows you to store objects such as users, groups, or service principals as identities. Azure AD also allows you to use those identities to authenticate with different Azure services. Azure AD authentication is supported for Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, SQL Server on Windows Azure VMs, Azure Synapse Analytics, and SQL Server. For more information, see [Use Azure Active Directory authentication](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview) and [Configure and manage Azure AD authentication with Azure SQL](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-configure).

If your Windows Server Active Directory is federated with Azure AD, users can authenticate with SQL Server using their Windows credentials, either as a Windows logins or an Azure AD login. Azure AD doesn't support all AD features, such as service accounts or complex networking forest architecture that is supported for Windows Server Active Directory.

## Connect SQL Server to Azure with Azure AD

For SQL Server to communicate with Azure, both SQL Server and the Windows or Linux host it runs on must be registered with [Azure Arc](../../../sql-server/azure-arc/overview.md). To do this, you'll need to install the [Azure Arc Agent](/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview) and [Azure extension for SQL Server](../../../sql-server/azure-arc/overview.md). This will facilitate SQL Server's  communication with Azure.

To get started, see [Connect your SQL Server to Azure Arc](../../../sql-server/azure-arc/connect.md).

## Authentication methods

The following authentication methods are available when connecting to SQL Server using Azure AD authentication.

### Azure Active Directory Password

Allows specifying the username and password to the client and driver, but this is disabled on many tenants for security reasons. When possible, we recommend avoiding this as it requires sending passwords over the network. These connections are encrypted, but it's best practice to never send them in the first place.

### Azure Active Directory Integrated

When the Windows domain is synchronized with Azure AD and a user is logged into the Windows domain, the user's Windows credentials are used for Azure AD authentication.

### Azure Active Directory Universal with Multi-Factor Authentication

This is the standard interactive method with multi-factor authentication option for Azure AD accounts. This will work in most scenarios.

### Azure Active Directory Service Principal

A service principal is an identity that can be created for use with automated tools, jobs and applications. With the Service Principal authentication method, you can connect to your SQL instance using the client ID and secret of a service principal identity.

### Azure Active Directory Managed Identity

Managed identities are special forms of service principals. There are two types of managed identities: system-assigned and user-assigned. System-assigned managed identities are enabled directly on an Azure resource, whereas user-assigned managed identities are a standalone resource that can be assigned to one or more Azure resources.

> [!Note]
> In order to use a managed identity to connect to a SQL resource through GUI clients such as SSMS and ADS, the machine running the client application must have an Azure AD client running with the identity's certificate stored in it. This is most commonly achieved through an Azure VM, as the identity can be easily assigned to the machine through the VM's portal blade.

### Azure Active Directory Default

The Default authentication option with Azure Active Directory enables authentication that's performed through password-less and non-interactive mechanisms including Managed Identities, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Azure CLI, and more. 

### Azure Active Directory access token

Some non-GUI clients such as [Invoke-sqlcmd](/powershell/module/sqlserver/invoke-sqlcmd) allow providing an access token. The scope or audience of the access token must be `https://database.windows.net/`.

## Remarks

- Only [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] on-premises with a supported Windows or Linux operating system, or [SQL Server 2022 on Windows Azure VMs](/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/security-considerations-best-practices#azure-ad-authentication-preview), is supported for Azure AD authentication.
- To connect SQL Server to Azure Arc, the Azure AD account needs the following permissions:
  - Member of the *Azure Connected Machine Onboarding* group or *Contributor* role in the resource group.
  - Member of the *Azure Connected Machine Resource Administrator* role in the resource group.
  - Member of the *Reader* role in the resource group.
