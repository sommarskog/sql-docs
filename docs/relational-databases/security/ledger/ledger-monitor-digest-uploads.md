# Monitor digest uploads

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2022 Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2022-asdb-asmi.md)]

::: zone pivot="as1-azure-sql-database"

You can monitor failed and successful ledger digest uploads in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) in the **Metrics** view of your Azure SQL Database.

::: zone pivot="as1-sql-server"

You can monitor failed and successful ledger digest uploads with [Extended Events](../../extended-events/extended-events.md) in SQL Server. Select the events *ledger_digest_upload_failed* and *ledger_digest_upload_success* in the Extended Event session.

You can monitor failed and successful ledger digest uploads with [Extended Events](../../extended-events/extended-events.md) in Azure SQL Managed Instance. Select the events *ledger_digest_upload_failed* and *ledger_digest_upload_success* in the Extended Event session.

## Digest upload alerts recommendation

::: zone pivot="as1-azure-sql-database"

We recommend you configure alerts on failed ledger digest uploads if you want to be notified when a digest upload failed. Failures might occur due to revoked permissions on the storage account or network configuration that makes the storage account inaccessible. Optionally, you could also configure an alert on successful ledger digest uploads. If the number of successful ledger digest uploads drops under a certain value or zero due to someone disabling the automatic digest upload, the alert can help raise attention to this matter. Digest uploads that are explicitly disabled wouldn't be considered a failure in this case.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="as1-sql-server"

We recommend you configure an alert on event number *37417 - Uploading ledger digest failed*. The alert can be configured using [SQL Agent Alert](../../../ssms/agent/create-an-alert-using-an-error-number.md) or your favorite third-party monitoring tool.
