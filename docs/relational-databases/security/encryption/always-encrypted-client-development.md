# Develop applications using Always Encrypted
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

[Always Encrypted](../../../relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine.md) is a client-side encryption technology that ensures sensitive data (and related encryption keys) are never revealed to the SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. With Always Encrypted, a client driver transparently encrypts sensitive data before passing the data to the Database Engine, and it transparently decrypts data retrieved from encrypted database columns.

For details about developing applications that use Always Encrypted protected databases, and which client drivers and which driver versions support Always Encrypted, see:
