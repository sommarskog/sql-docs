# Manage keys for Always Encrypted with secure enclaves

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2019-windows-only-asdb](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019-windows-only-asdb.md)]

[Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](always-encrypted-enclaves.md) extends key management for [Always Encrypted](always-encrypted-database-engine.md) by introducing enclave-enabled keys: 

- **Enclave-enabled column master key** - a column master key that is created with the `ENCLAVE_COMPUTATIONS` property specified in the column master key metadata object inside the database. 
- **Enclave-enabled column encryption key** - a column encryption key that is encrypted with an enclave-enabled column master key. Only enclave-enabled column encryption keys can be used for computations inside a server-side secure enclave. 

The general guidelines and processes for [managing Always Encrypted keys](overview-of-key-management-for-always-encrypted.md) apply to managing enclave-enabled keys. 

## Managing keys

The following articles discuss the aspects specific to managing enclave-enabled keys.

- [Provision enclave-enabled keys](always-encrypted-enclaves-provision-keys.md)
- [Rotate enclave-enabled keys](always-encrypted-enclaves-rotate-keys.md)
