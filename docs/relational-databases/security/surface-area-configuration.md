# Surface area configuration

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

In the default configuration of new installations of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], many features are not enabled. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] selectively installs and starts only key services and features, to minimize the number of features that can be attacked by a malicious user. A system administrator can change these defaults at installation time and also selectively enable or disable features of a running instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Additionally, some components may not be available when connecting from other computers until protocols are configured.

> [!NOTE]  
> Unlike new installations, no existing services or features are turned off during an upgrade, but additional surface area configuration options can be applied after the upgrade is completed.

## Protocols, connection, and startup options

Use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager to start and stop services, configure the startup options, and enable protocols and other connection options.

#### Start SQL Server Configuration Manager

1. On the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentUI](../../includes/sscurrentui-md.md)], point to **Configuration Tools**, and then select **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.

   - Use the **SQL Server Services** area to start components and configure the automatic starting options.

   - Use the **SQL Server Network Configuration** area to enable connection protocols, and connection options such as fixed TCP/IP ports, or forcing encryption.

For more information, see [SQL Server Configuration Manager](../../relational-databases/sql-server-configuration-manager.md). Remote connectivity can also depend upon the correct configuration of a firewall. For more information, see [Configure the Windows Firewall to Allow SQL Server Access](../../sql-server/install/configure-the-windows-firewall-to-allow-sql-server-access.md).

## Enable and disable features

Enabling and disabling [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features can be configured using facets in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].

#### Configure surface area using facets

1. In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] connect to a component of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

1. In Object Explorer, right-click the server, and then select **Facets**.

1. In the **View Facets** dialog box, expand the **Facet** list, and select the appropriate **Surface Area Configuration** facet (**Surface Area Configuration**, **Surface Area Configuration for Analysis Services**, or **Surface Area Configuration for Reporting Services**).

1. In the **Facet properties** area, select the values that you want for each property.

1. Select **OK**.

To periodically check the configuration of a facet, use Policy-Based Management. For more information about Policy-Based Management, see [Administer Servers by Using Policy-Based Management](../../relational-databases/policy-based-management/administer-servers-by-using-policy-based-management.md).

You can also set [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] options using the `sp_configure` stored procedure. For more information, see [Server Configuration Options (SQL Server)](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-configuration-options-sql-server.md).

To change the **EnableIntegrated Security** property of [!INCLUDE[ssRS](../../includes/ssrs.md)], use the property settings in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. To change the **Schedule events and report delivery** property and the **Web service and HTTP access** property, edit the **RSReportServer.config** configuration file.

## Command-prompt options

Use the **Invoke-PolicyEvaluation** [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PowerShell cmdlet to invoke Surface Area Configuration Policies. For more information, see [Use the Database Engine cmdlets](../../powershell/sql-server-powershell.md).

## SOAP and Service Broker endpoints

To turn endpoints off, use Policy-Based Management. To create and alter the properties of endpoints, use [CREATE ENDPOINT (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/create-endpoint-transact-sql.md) and [ALTER ENDPOINT (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/alter-endpoint-transact-sql.md).
