# Annotated XSD Schemas in SQLXML 4.0
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb.md)]
  This section provides information about using annotated XSD schemas in SQLXML 4.0. In previous versions of SQLXML, similar functionality was provided with XML-Data Reduced (XDR) schemas. This section also provides XDR information for legacy applications.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Introduction to Annotated XSD Schemas &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../../relational-databases/sqlxml/annotated-xsd-schemas/introduction-to-annotated-xsd-schemas-sqlxml-4-0.md)  
 Provides an overview of annotated XSD schemas in SQLXML 4.0.  
  
 [Using Annotations in XSD Schemas &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../../relational-databases/sqlxml-annotated-xsd-schemas-using/using-annotations-in-xsd-schemas-sqlxml-4-0.md)  
 Describes how to use annotations in XSD schemas in numerous scenarios, and provides examples.  
  
 [Using Annotated XSD Schemas in Queries &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../../relational-databases/sqlxml/annotated-xsd-schemas/using-annotated-xsd-schemas-in-queries-sqlxml-4-0.md)  
 Describes how to use annotated XSD schemas in queries.  
  
 [Converting Annotated XDR Schemas to Equivalent XSD Schemas &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../../relational-databases/sqlxml/annotated-xsd-schemas/converting-annotated-xdr-schemas-to-equivalent-xsd-schemas-sqlxml-4-0.md)  
 Describes how to convert XDR schemas to the equivalent XSD schemas for SQLXML 4.0.  
  
 [Annotated XDR Schemas &#40;Deprecated in SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../../relational-databases/sqlxml/annotated-xsd-schemas/annotated-xdr-schemas-deprecated-in-sqlxml-4-0.md)  
 Previous versions of SQLXML supported annotations in XDR schemas. Annotated XDR schemas are deprecated in SQLXML 4.0, but this section is provided as a reference for legacy applications.
