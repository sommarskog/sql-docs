# Set or Change the Column Collation
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]
  You can override the database collation for **char**, **varchar**, **text**, **nchar**, **nvarchar**, and **ntext** data by specifying a different collation for a specific column of a table and using one of the following:  
  
-   The COLLATE clause of [CREATE TABLE](../../t-sql/statements/create-table-transact-sql.md) and [ALTER TABLE](../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md), as seen in the examples below. 

    -   **In-place conversion.** Consider one of the existing tables defined below:

        ```sql
        -- NVARCHAR column is encoded in UTF-16 because a supplementary character enabled collation is used
        CREATE TABLE dbo.MyTable (CharCol NVARCHAR(50) COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CI_AI_SC);

        -- VARCHAR column is encoded the Latin code page and therefore is not Unicode capable
        CREATE TABLE dbo.MyTable (CharCol VARCHAR(50) COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CI_AI);
        ```

        To convert the column in-place to use UTF-8, run an `ALTER COLUMN` statement that sets the required data type and a UTF-8 enabled collation:

        ```sql 
        ALTER TABLE dbo.MyTable 
        ALTER COLUMN CharCol VARCHAR(50) COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CI_AI_SC_UTF8
        ```

        This method is easy to implement, however it's a possibly blocking operation which may become an issue for large tables and busy applications.

    -   **Copy and replace.** Consider one of the existing tables defined below:

        ```sql
        -- NVARCHAR column is encoded in UTF-16 because a supplementary character enabled collation is used
        CREATE TABLE dbo.MyTable (CharCol NVARCHAR(50) COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CI_AI_SC);
        GO

        -- VARCHAR column is encoded using the Latin code page and therefore is not Unicode capable
        CREATE TABLE dbo.MyTable (CharCol VARCHAR(50) COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CI_AI);
        GO
        ```

        To convert the column to use UTF-8, copy the data to a new table where the target column is already the required data type and a UTF-8 enabled collation, and then replace the old table:

        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE dbo.MyTableNew (CharCol VARCHAR(50) COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CI_AI_SC_UTF8);
        GO
        INSERT INTO dbo.MyTableNew 
        SELECT * FROM dbo.MyTable;
        GO
        DROP TABLE dbo.MyTable;
        GO
        EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.MyTableNew', 'dbo.MyTable';
        GO
        ```

        This method is much faster than in-place conversion, but handling complex schemas with many dependencies (FKs, PKs, Triggers, DFs) and syncing the tail of the table (if the database is in use) requires more planning.

-   [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. For more information, see [Modify Columns (Database Engine)](../../relational-databases/tables/modify-columns-database-engine.md#SSMSProcedure).  
  
-   Using the **Column.Collation** property in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO).  
  
 You cannot change the collation of a column that is currently referenced by any one of the following:  
  
-   A computed column  
-   An index  
-   Distribution statistics, either generated automatically or by the `CREATE STATISTICS` statement  
-   A CHECK constraint  
-   A FOREIGN KEY constraint  
  
 When you work with **tempdb**, the [COLLATE](~/t-sql/statements/collations.md) clause includes a *database_default* option to specify that a column in a temporary table uses the collation default of the current user database for the connection instead of the collation of **tempdb**.  
  
## Collations and text Columns  
 You can insert or update values in a **text** column whose collation is different from the code page of the default collation of the database. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] implicitly converts the values to the collation of the column.  
  
## Collations and tempdb  
 The **tempdb** database is built every time [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is started and has the same default collation as the **model** database. This is typically the same as the default collation of the instance. If you create a user database and specify a different default collation than **model**, the user database has a different default collation than **tempdb**. All temporary stored procedures or temporary tables are created and stored in **tempdb**. This means that all implicit columns in temporary tables and all coercible-default constants, variables, and parameters in temporary stored procedures have collations that are different from comparable objects created in permanent tables and stored procedures.  
  
 This could lead to problems with a mismatch in collations between user-defined databases and system database objects. For example, an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses the Latin1_General_CS_AS collation and you execute the following statements:  
  
```sql  
CREATE DATABASE TestDB COLLATE Estonian_CS_AS;  
USE TestDB;  
CREATE TABLE TestPermTab (PrimaryKey int PRIMARY KEY, Col1 nchar );  
```  
  
 In this system, the **tempdb** database uses the Latin1_General_CS_AS collation with code page 1252, and `TestDB` and `TestPermTab.Col1` use the `Estonian_CS_AS` collation with code page 1257. For example:  
  
```sql  
USE TestDB;  
GO  
-- Create a temporary table with the same column declarations  
-- as TestPermTab  
CREATE TABLE #TestTempTab (PrimaryKey int PRIMARY KEY, Col1 nchar );  
INSERT INTO #TestTempTab  
         SELECT * FROM TestPermTab;  
GO  
```  
  
 With the previous example, the **tempdb** database uses the Latin1_General_CS_AS collation, and `TestDB` and `TestTab.Col1` use the `Estonian_CS_AS` collation. For example:  
  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM TestPermTab AS a INNER JOIN #TestTempTab on a.Col1 = #TestTempTab.Col1;  
```  
  
 Because **tempdb** uses the default server collation and `TestPermTab.Col1` uses a different collation, SQL Server returns this error: "Cannot resolve collation conflict between 'Latin1_General_CI_AS_KS_WS' and 'Estonian_CS_AS' in equal to operation."  
  
 To prevent the error, you can use one of the following alternatives:  
  
-   Specify that the temporary table column use the default collation of the user database, not **tempdb**. This enables the temporary table to work with similarly formatted tables in multiple databases, if that is required of your system.  
  
    ```sql  
    CREATE TABLE #TestTempTab  
       (PrimaryKey int PRIMARY KEY,  
        Col1 nchar COLLATE database_default  
       );  
    ```  
  
-   Specify the correct collation for the `#TestTempTab` column:  
  
    ```sql  
    CREATE TABLE #TestTempTab  
       (PrimaryKey int PRIMARY KEY,  
        Col1 nchar COLLATE Estonian_CS_AS  
       );  
    ```
