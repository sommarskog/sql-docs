# srv_alloc (Extended Stored Procedure API)
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
    
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)] Use CLR integration instead.  
  
 Allocates memory dynamically.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
void * srv_alloc ( DBINT  
size  
);  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *size*  
 Specifies the number of bytes to allocate.  
  
## Returns  
 A pointer to the newly allocated space. If *size* bytes cannot be allocated, a null pointer is returned.  
  
## Remarks  
 The **srv_alloc** function is equivalent to the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows API  **GlobalAlloc** function. Normal Windows API C run-time memory management functions can be used in an Extended Stored Procedure API application.
