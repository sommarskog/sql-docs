# srv_got_attention (Extended Stored Procedure API)
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
    
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)] Use CLR integration instead.  
  
 Checks whether the current connection or task needs to be aborted and returns TRUE if the connection is killed or the batch is aborted  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
BOOL srv_got_attention (SRV_PROC *   
srvproc  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *srvproc*  
 Pointer identifying a database connection.  
  
## Return Value  
 TRUE if the connection is killed or the batch is aborted. FALSE if the connection or batch is active.  
  
## Remarks  
 A long-running extended stored procedure should check the server attention by calling **srv_got_attention** periodically so that the procedure may terminate itself when the connection is killed or the batch is aborted.

>  You should thoroughly review the source code of extended stored procedures, and you should test the compiled DLLs before you install them on a production server.
