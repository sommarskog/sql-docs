|Column name|Data type|Description|

|**object_name**|**nchar(128)**|Performance object name, such as **SQLServer:LockManager** or **SQLServer:BufferManager**.|  
|**counter_name**|**nchar(128)**|Name of the performance counter within the object, such as **Page Requests** or **Locks Requested**.|  
|**instance_name**|**nchar(128)**|Named instance of the counter. For example, there are counters maintained for each type of lock, such as **Table**, **Page**, **Key**, and so on. The instance name distinguishes between similar counters.|  
|**cntr_value**|**bigint**|Actual counter value. Frequently, this will be a level or monotonically increasing counter that counts occurrences of the instance event.|  
|**cntr_type**|**int**|Type of counter as defined by the Windows performance architecture.|
