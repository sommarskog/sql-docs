# Deadlocks guide
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

This article discusses deadlocks in the SQL Server Database Engine in depth. Deadlocks are caused competing, concurrent locks in the database, often in multi-step transactions. For more on transaction locking, see [Transaction locking and row versioning guide](sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide.md).

For more specific information on identification and prevention of deadlocks in Azure SQL Database, see [Analyze and prevent deadlocks in Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/analyze-prevent-deadlocks).

## <a id="deadlocks"></a> Understand deadlocks

A deadlock occurs when two or more tasks permanently block each other by each task having a lock on a resource that the other tasks are trying to lock. For example:  
  
-   Transaction A acquires a shared lock on row 1.  
-   Transaction B acquires a shared lock on row 2.  
-   Transaction A now requests an exclusive lock on row 2, and is blocked until transaction B finishes and releases the shared lock it has on row 2.  
-   Transaction B now requests an exclusive lock on row 1, and is blocked until transaction A finishes and releases the shared lock it has on row 1.  
  
Transaction A cannot complete until transaction B completes, but transaction B is blocked by transaction A. This condition is also called a cyclic dependency: Transaction A has a dependency on transaction B, and transaction B closes the circle by having a dependency on transaction A.  
  
Both transactions in a deadlock will wait forever unless the deadlock is broken by an external process. the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] deadlock monitor periodically checks for tasks that are in a deadlock. If the monitor detects a cyclic dependency, it chooses one of the tasks as a victim and terminates its transaction with an error. This allows the other task to complete its transaction. The application with the transaction that terminated with an error can retry the transaction, which usually completes after the other deadlocked transaction has finished.  
  
Deadlocking is often confused with normal blocking. When a transaction requests a lock on a resource locked by another transaction, the requesting transaction waits until the lock is released. By default, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] transactions do not time out, unless LOCK_TIMEOUT is set. The requesting transaction is blocked, not deadlocked, because the requesting transaction has not done anything to block the transaction owning the lock. Eventually, the owning transaction will complete and release the lock, and then the requesting transaction will be granted the lock and proceed. Deadlocks are resolved almost immediately, whereas blocking can, in theory, persist indefinitely. Deadlocks are sometimes called a deadly embrace.  
  
Deadlock is a condition that can occur on any system with multiple threads, not just on a relational database management system, and can occur for resources other than locks on database objects. For example, a thread in a multithreaded operating system might acquire one or more resources, such as blocks of memory. If the resource being acquired is currently owned by another thread, the first thread may have to wait for the owning thread to release the target resource. The waiting thread is said to have a dependency on the owning thread for that particular resource. In an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)], sessions can deadlock when acquiring non-database resources, such as memory or threads.  
  
:::image type="content" source="media/sql-server-deadlocks-guide/deadlock.png" alt-text="Diagram showing a transaction deadlock." lightbox="media/sql-server-deadlocks-guide/deadlock.png":::
  
In the illustration, transaction T1 has a dependency on transaction T2 for the `Part` table lock resource. Similarly, transaction T2 has a dependency on transaction T1 for the `Supplier` table lock resource. Because these dependencies form a cycle, there is a deadlock between transactions T1 and T2.  
  
Deadlocks can also occur when a table is partitioned and the `LOCK_ESCALATION` setting of `ALTER TABLE` is set to AUTO. When `LOCK_ESCALATION` is set to AUTO, concurrency increases by allowing the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] to lock table partitions at the HoBT level instead of at the table level. However, when separate transactions hold partition locks in a table and want a lock somewhere on the other transactions partition, this causes a deadlock. This type of deadlock can be avoided by setting `LOCK_ESCALATION` to `TABLE`; although this setting will reduce concurrency by forcing large updates to a partition to wait for a table lock.  
  
## Detect and ending deadlocks

A deadlock occurs when two or more tasks permanently block each other by each task having a lock on a resource that the other tasks are trying to lock. The following graph presents a high level view of a deadlock state where:  
  
-   Task T1 has a lock on resource R1 (indicated by the arrow from R1 to T1) and has requested a lock on resource R2 (indicated by the arrow from T1 to R2).  
-   Task T2 has a lock on resource R2 (indicated by the arrow from R2 to T2) and has requested a lock on resource R1 (indicated by the arrow from T2 to R1).  
-   Because neither task can continue until a resource is available and neither resource can be released until a task continues, a deadlock state exists.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-server-deadlocks-guide/task-deadlock-state.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the tasks in a deadlock state." lightbox="media/sql-server-deadlocks-guide/task-deadlock-state.png":::
  
The [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] automatically detects deadlock cycles within [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. the [!include[ssdenoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] chooses one of the sessions as a deadlock victim and the current transaction is terminated with an error to break the deadlock.  
  
### <a id="deadlock_resources"></a> Resources that can deadlock

Each user session might have one or more tasks running on its behalf where each task might acquire or wait to acquire a variety of resources. The following types of resources can cause blocking that could result in a deadlock.  
  
-   **Locks**. Waiting to acquire locks on resources, such as objects, pages, rows, metadata, and applications can cause a deadlock. For example, transaction T1 has a shared (S) lock on row r1 and is waiting to get an exclusive (X) lock on r2. Transaction T2 has a shared (S) lock on r2 and is waiting to get an exclusive (X) lock on row r1. This results in a lock cycle in which T1 and T2 wait for each other to release the locked resources.  
  
-   **Worker threads**. A queued task waiting for an available worker thread can cause a deadlock. If the queued task owns resources that are blocking all worker threads, a deadlock will result. For example, session S1 starts a transaction and acquires a shared (S) lock on row r1 and then goes to sleep. Active sessions running on all available worker threads are trying to acquire exclusive (X) locks on row r1. Because session S1 cannot acquire a worker thread, it cannot commit the transaction and release the lock on row r1. This results in a deadlock.  
  
-   **Memory**. When concurrent requests are waiting for memory grants that cannot be satisfied with the available memory, a deadlock can occur. For example, two concurrent queries, Q1 and Q2, execute as user-defined functions that acquire 10 MB and 20 MB of memory respectively. If each query needs 30 MB and the total available memory is 20 MB, then Q1 and Q2 must wait for each other to release memory, and this results in a deadlock.  
  
-   **Parallel query execution-related resources**. Coordinator, producer, or consumer threads associated with an exchange port may block each other causing a deadlock usually when including at least one other process that is not a part of the parallel query. Also, when a parallel query starts execution, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] determines the degree of parallelism, or the number of worker threads, based upon the current workload. If the system workload unexpectedly changes, for example, where new queries start running on the server or the system runs out of worker threads, then a deadlock could occur.  
  
-   **Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS) resources**. These resources are used to control interleaving of multiple active requests under MARS. For more information, see [Using Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS)](../relational-databases/native-client/features/using-multiple-active-result-sets-mars.md).  
  
    -   **User resource**. When a thread is waiting for a resource that is potentially controlled by a user application, the resource is considered to be an external or user resource and is treated like a lock.  
  
    -   **Session mutex**. The tasks running in one session are interleaved, meaning that only one task can run under the session at a given time. Before the task can run, it must have exclusive access to the session mutex.  
  
    -   **Transaction mutex**. All tasks running in one transaction are interleaved, meaning that only one task can run under the transaction at a given time. Before the task can run, it must have exclusive access to the transaction mutex.  
  
     In order for a task to run under MARS, it must acquire the session mutex. If the task is running under a transaction, it must then acquire the transaction mutex. This guarantees that only one task is active at one time in a given session and a given transaction. Once the required mutexes have been acquired, the task can execute. When the task finishes, or yields in the middle of the request, it will first release transaction mutex followed by the session mutex in reverse order of acquisition. However, deadlocks can occur with these resources. In the following pseudocode, two tasks, user request U1 and user request U2, are running in the same session.  
  
    ```  
    U1:    Rs1=Command1.Execute("insert sometable EXEC usp_someproc");  
    U2:    Rs2=Command2.Execute("select colA from sometable");  
    ```  
  
     The stored procedure executing from user request U1 has acquired the session mutex. If the stored procedure takes a long time to execute, it is assumed by the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] that the stored procedure is waiting for input from the user. User request U2 is waiting for the session mutex while the user is waiting for the result set from U2, and U1 is waiting for a user resource. This is deadlock state logically illustrated as:  
  
    :::image type="content" source="media/sql-server-deadlocks-guide/logical-flow-example-stored-procedure-MARS.png" alt-text="Diagram of the logical flow of a stored procedure in MARS." lightbox="media/sql-server-deadlocks-guide/logical-flow-example-stored-procedure-MARS.png":::
  
## <a id="deadlock_detection"></a> Deadlock detection

All of the resources listed in the section above participate in the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] deadlock detection scheme. Deadlock detection is performed by a lock monitor thread that periodically initiates a search through all of the tasks in an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]. The following points describe the search process:  
  
-   The default interval is 5 seconds.  
-   If the lock monitor thread finds deadlocks, the deadlock detection interval will drop from 5 seconds to as low as 100 milliseconds depending on the frequency of deadlocks.  
-   If the lock monitor thread stops finding deadlocks, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] increases the intervals between searches to 5 seconds.  
-   If a deadlock has just been detected, it is assumed that the next threads that must wait for a lock are entering the deadlock cycle. The first couple of lock waits after a deadlock has been detected will immediately trigger a deadlock search rather than wait for the next deadlock detection interval. For example, if the current interval is 5 seconds, and a deadlock was just detected, the next lock wait will kick off the deadlock detector immediately. If this lock wait is part of a deadlock, it will be detected right away rather than during next deadlock search.  
  
The [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] typically performs periodic deadlock detection only. Because the number of deadlocks encountered in the system is usually small, periodic deadlock detection helps to reduce the overhead of deadlock detection in the system.  
  
When the lock monitor initiates deadlock search for a particular thread, it identifies the resource on which the thread is waiting. The lock monitor then finds the owner(s) for that particular resource and recursively continues the deadlock search for those threads until it finds a cycle. A cycle identified in this manner forms a deadlock.  
  
After a deadlock is detected, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] ends a deadlock by choosing one of the threads as a deadlock victim. The [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] terminates the current batch being executed for the thread, rolls back the transaction of the deadlock victim, and returns a 1205 error to the application. Rolling back the transaction for the deadlock victim releases all locks held by the transaction. This allows the transactions of the other threads to become unblocked and continue. The 1205 deadlock victim error records information about the threads and resources involved in a deadlock in the error log.  
  
By default, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] chooses as the deadlock victim the session running the transaction that is least expensive to roll back. Alternatively, a user can specify the priority of sessions in a deadlock situation using the `SET DEADLOCK_PRIORITY` statement. DEADLOCK_PRIORITY can be set to LOW, NORMAL, or HIGH, or alternatively can be set to any integer value in the range (-10 to 10). The deadlock priority defaults to NORMAL. If two sessions have different deadlock priorities, the session with the lower priority is chosen as the deadlock victim. If both sessions have the same deadlock priority, the session with the transaction that is least expensive to roll back is chosen. If sessions involved in the deadlock cycle have the same deadlock priority and the same cost, a victim is chosen randomly.  
  
When working with CLR, the deadlock monitor automatically detects deadlock for synchronization resources (monitors, reader/writer lock and thread join) accessed inside managed procedures. However, the deadlock is resolved by throwing an exception in the procedure that was selected to be the deadlock victim. It is important to understand that the exception does not automatically release resources currently owned by the victim; the resources must be explicitly released. Consistent with exception behavior, the exception used to identify a deadlock victim can be caught and dismissed.  
  
## <a id="deadlock_tools"></a> Deadlock information tools

To view deadlock information, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] provides monitoring tools in the form of the `system_health` xEvent session, two trace flags, and the deadlock graph event in SQL Profiler.  

> [!NOTE]
> This section contains information on extended events, trace flags, and traces, but the Deadlock extended event is the recommended method for capturing deadlock information.

### <a id="deadlock_xevent"></a> Deadlock extended event

Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../includes/sssql11-md.md)], the `xml_deadlock_report` Extended Event (xEvent) should be used instead of the Deadlock graph event class in SQL Trace or SQL Profiler.

Also starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../includes/sssql11-md.md)], when deadlocks occur, the `system_health` session already captures all `xml_deadlock_report` xEvents that contain the deadlock graph. Because the *system_health* session is enabled by default, it's not required that a separate xEvent session is configured to capture deadlock information. No additional action to capture deadlock information with the `xml_deadlock_report` xEvent is required.

The deadlock graph captured typically has three distinct nodes:

-   **victim-list**. The deadlock victim process identifier.
-   **process-list**. Information on all the processes involved in the deadlock.
-   **resource-list**. Information about the resources involved in the deadlock.

Opening the `system_health` session file or ring buffer, if the `xml_deadlock_report` xEvent is recorded, [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../includes/ssManStudio-md.md)] presents a graphical depiction of the tasks and resources involved in a deadlock, as seen in the following example: 

:::image type="content" source="media/sql-server-deadlocks-guide/extended-event-xevent-deadlock-graph.png" alt-text="A screenshot from SSMS of a XEvent Deadlock Graph visual diagram." lightbox="media/sql-server-deadlocks-guide/extended-event-xevent-deadlock-graph.png":::

The following query can view all deadlock events captured by the `system_health` session ring buffer:

```sql
SELECT xdr.value('@timestamp', 'datetime') AS [Date],
    xdr.query('.') AS [Event_Data]
FROM (SELECT CAST([target_data] AS XML) AS Target_Data
            FROM sys.dm_xe_session_targets AS xt
            INNER JOIN sys.dm_xe_sessions AS xs ON xs.address = xt.event_session_address
            WHERE xs.name = N'system_health'
              AND xt.target_name = N'ring_buffer'
    ) AS XML_Data
CROSS APPLY Target_Data.nodes('RingBufferTarget/event[@name="xml_deadlock_report"]') AS XEventData(xdr)
ORDER BY [Date] DESC;
```

[!INCLUDE[ssResult](../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

### <a id="deadlock_traceflags"></a> Trace Flag 1204 and Trace Flag 1222

When deadlocks occur, Trace Flag 1204 and Trace Flag 1222 return information that is captured in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error log. Trace Flag 1204 reports deadlock information formatted by each node involved in the deadlock. Trace Flag 1222 formats deadlock information, first by processes and then by resources. It is possible to enable both trace flags to obtain two representations of the same deadlock event.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Avoid using Trace Flag 1204 and 1222 on workload-intensive systems that are experiencing deadlocks. Using these trace flags may introduce performance issues. Instead, use the [Deadlock Extended Event](#deadlock_xevent) to capture the necessary information.
  
In addition to defining the properties of Trace Flag 1204 and 1222, the following table also shows the similarities and differences.  
  
|Property|Trace Flag 1204 and Trace Flag 1222|Trace Flag 1204 only|Trace Flag 1222 only|  
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|  
|Output format|Output is captured in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error log.|Focused on the nodes involved in the deadlock. Each node has a dedicated section, and the final section describes the deadlock victim.|Returns information in an XML-like format that does not conform to an XML Schema Definition (XSD) schema. The format has three major sections. The first section declares the deadlock victim. The second section describes each process involved in the deadlock. The third section describes the resources that are synonymous with nodes in Trace Flag 1204.|  
|Identifying attributes|**SPID:<x\> ECID:<x\>.** Identifies the system process ID thread in cases of parallel processes. The entry `SPID:<x> ECID:0`, where <x\> is replaced by the SPID value, represents the main thread. The entry `SPID:<x> ECID:<y>`, where <x\> is replaced by the SPID value and <y\> is greater than 0, represents the subthreads for the same SPID.<br /><br /> **BatchID** (**sbid** for Trace Flag 1222). Identifies the batch from which code execution is requesting or holding a lock. When Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS) is disabled, the BatchID value is 0. When MARS is enabled, the value for active batches is 1 to *n*. If there are no active batches in the session, BatchID is 0.<br /><br /> **Mode**.

### Profiler deadlock graph event

This is an event in SQL Profiler that presents a graphical depiction of the tasks and resources involved in a deadlock. The following example shows the output from SQL Profiler when the deadlock graph event is turned on.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SQL Profiler creates traces, which were deprecated in 2016 and replaced by Extended Events. Extended Events have far less performance overhead and are far more configurable than traces. Consider using the [Extended Events deadlock event](#deadlock_xevent) instead of traces.

For more information about the deadlock event, see [Lock:Deadlock Event Class](../relational-databases/event-classes/lock-deadlock-event-class.md). For more information about running the SQL Profiler deadlock graph, see [Save Deadlock Graphs (SQL Server Profiler)](../relational-databases/performance/save-deadlock-graphs-sql-server-profiler.md). 

There are equivalents for SQL Trace event classes in Extended Events, see [Extended Events Equivalents to SQL Trace Event Classes](extended-events/view-the-extended-events-equivalents-to-sql-trace-event-classes.md). Extended events are recommended over SQL Traces.
  
## Handle deadlocks

When an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] chooses a transaction as a deadlock victim, it terminates the current batch, rolls back the transaction, and returns error message 1205 to the application.  
  
`Your transaction (process ID #52) was deadlocked on {lock | communication buffer | thread} resources with another process and has been chosen as the deadlock victim. Rerun your transaction.`  
  
Because any application submitting [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] queries can be chosen as the deadlock victim, applications should have an error handler that can trap error message 1205. If an application does not trap the error, the application can proceed unaware that its transaction has been rolled back and errors can occur.    

Implementing an error handler that traps error message 1205 allows an application to handle the deadlock situation and take remedial action (for example, automatically resubmitting the query that was involved in the deadlock). By resubmitting the query automatically, the user does not need to know that a deadlock occurred.

The application should pause briefly before resubmitting its query. This gives the other transaction involved in the deadlock a chance to complete and release its locks that formed part of the deadlock cycle. This minimizes the likelihood of the deadlock reoccurring when the resubmitted query requests its locks.  
  
## Minimize deadlocks

Although deadlocks cannot be completely avoided, following certain coding conventions can minimize the chance of generating a deadlock. Minimizing deadlocks can increase transaction throughput and reduce system overhead because fewer transactions are:  
  
- Rolled back, undoing all the work performed by the transaction.  
- Resubmitted by applications because they were rolled back when deadlocked.  
  
To help minimize deadlocks:  
  
- Access objects in the same order.  
- Avoid user interaction in transactions.  -   Keep transactions short and in one batch.  
- Use a lower isolation level.  
- Use a row versioning-based isolation level.  
  - Set `READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT` database option on to enable read-committed transactions to use row versioning.  
  - Use snapshot isolation.  
- Use bound connections.  
  
### Access objects in the same order

If all concurrent transactions access objects in the same order, deadlocks are less likely to occur. For example, if two concurrent transactions obtain a lock on the `Supplier` table and then on the `Part` table, one transaction is blocked on the `Supplier` table until the other transaction is completed. After the first transaction commits or rolls back, the second continues, and a deadlock does not occur. Using stored procedures for all data modifications can standardize the order of accessing objects.  
  
:::image type="content" source="media/sql-server-deadlocks-guide/deadlock-diagram.png" alt-text="A diagram of a deadlock." lightbox="media/sql-server-deadlocks-guide/deadlock-diagram.png":::
  
### Avoid user interaction in transactions

Avoid writing transactions that include user interaction, because the speed of batches running without user intervention is much faster than the speed at which a user must manually respond to queries, such as replying to a prompt for a parameter requested by an application. For example, if a transaction is waiting for user input and the user goes to lunch or even home for the weekend, the user delays the transaction from completing. This degrades system throughput because any locks held by the transaction are released only when the transaction is committed or rolled back. Even if a deadlock situation does not arise, other transactions accessing the same resources are blocked while waiting for the transaction to complete.  
  
### Keep transactions short and in one batch

A deadlock typically occurs when several long-running transactions execute concurrently in the same database. The longer the transaction, the longer the exclusive or update locks are held, blocking other activity and leading to possible deadlock situations. 
  
Keeping transactions in one batch minimizes network roundtrips during a transaction, reducing possible delays in completing the transaction and releasing locks.  

For more about update locks, see [Transaction locking and row versioning guide](sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide.md#update).
  
### Use a lower isolation level

Determine whether a transaction can run at a lower isolation level. Implementing read committed allows a transaction to read data previously read (not modified) by another transaction without waiting for the first transaction to complete. Using a lower isolation level, such as read committed, holds shared locks for a shorter duration than a higher isolation level, such as serializable. This reduces locking contention.  
  
### Use a row versioning-based isolation level

When the `READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT` database option is set ON, a transaction running under read committed isolation level uses row versioning rather than shared locks during read operations.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Some applications rely upon locking and blocking behavior of read committed isolation. For these applications, some change is required before this option can be enabled.  
  
Snapshot isolation also uses row versioning, which does not use shared locks during read operations. Before a transaction can run under snapshot isolation, the `ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION` database option must be set `ON`.  
  
Implement these isolation levels to minimize deadlocks that can occur between read and write operations.  

### Use bound connections

Using bound connections, two or more connections opened by the same application can cooperate with each other. Any locks acquired by the secondary connections are held as if they were acquired by the primary connection, and vice versa. Therefore they do not block each other.  

### Stop a transaction

In a deadlock scenario, the victim transaction is automatically stopped and rolled back. There is no need to stop a transaction in a deadlock scenario.
  
## Cause a deadlock

> [!NOTE]
> This example works in the `AdventureWorksLT2019` sample database with the default schema and data when [READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT has been enabled](../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-set-options.md#read_committed_snapshot--on--off-). To download this sample, visit [AdventureWorks sample databases](../samples/adventureworks-install-configure.md).

To cause a deadlock, you will need to connect two sessions to the `AdventureWorksLT2019` database. We'll refer to these sessions as **Session A** and **Session B**. You can create these two sessions simply by creating two query windows in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

In **Session A**, run the following Transact-SQL. This code begins an [explicit transaction](sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide.md#starting-transactions) and runs a single statement that updates the `SalesLT.Product` table. To do this, the transaction acquires an [update (U) lock](sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide.md#behavior-when-modifying-data) on one row on table `SalesLT.Product` which is converted to an exclusive (X) lock. We leave the transaction open.

```sql
BEGIN TRAN

    UPDATE SalesLT.Product SET SellEndDate = SellEndDate + 1
        WHERE Color = 'Red';

```

Now, in **Session B**, run the following Transact-SQL. This code doesn't explicitly begin a transaction. Instead, it operates in [autocommit transaction mode](sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide.md#starting-transactions). This statement updates the `SalesLT.ProductDescription` table. The update will take out an update (U) lock on 72 rows on the `SalesLT.ProductDescription` table. The query joins to other tables, including the `SalesLT.Product` table.

```sql
UPDATE SalesLT.ProductDescription SET Description = Description
    FROM SalesLT.ProductDescription as pd
    JOIN SalesLT.ProductModelProductDescription as pmpd on
        pd.ProductDescriptionID = pmpd.ProductDescriptionID
    JOIN SalesLT.ProductModel as pm on
        pmpd.ProductModelID = pm.ProductModelID
    JOIN SalesLT.Product as p on
        pm.ProductModelID=p.ProductModelID
    WHERE p.Color = 'Silver';
```

To complete this update, **Session B** needs a shared (S) lock on rows on the table `SalesLT.Product`, including the row that is locked by **Session A**. **Session B** will be blocked on `SalesLT.Product`.

Return to **Session A**. Run the following Transact-SQL statement. This runs a second UPDATE statement as part of the open transaction.

```sql
    UPDATE SalesLT.ProductDescription SET Description = Description
        FROM SalesLT.ProductDescription as pd
        JOIN SalesLT.ProductModelProductDescription as pmpd on
            pd.ProductDescriptionID = pmpd.ProductDescriptionID
        JOIN SalesLT.ProductModel as pm on
            pmpd.ProductModelID = pm.ProductModelID
        JOIN SalesLT.Product as p on
            pm.ProductModelID=p.ProductModelID
        WHERE p.Color = 'Red';
```

The second update statement in **Session A** will be blocked by **Session B** on the `SalesLT.ProductDescription`.

**Session A** and **Session B** are now mutually blocking one another. Neither transaction can proceed, as they each need a resource that is locked by the other.

After a few seconds, the deadlock monitor will identify that the transactions in **Session A** and **Session B** are mutually blocking one another, and that neither can make progress. You should see a deadlock occur, with **Session A** chosen as the deadlock victim. **Session B** will complete successfully. An error message will appear in **Session A** with text similar to the following:

```
Msg 1205, Level 13, State 51, Line 7
Transaction (Process ID 51) was deadlocked on lock resources with another process and has been chosen as the deadlock victim. Rerun the transaction.
```

If a deadlock is not raised, verify that READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT has been enabled in your sample database. Deadlocks may occur in any database configuration, but this example requires READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT to be enabled.

You could then view details of the deadlock in the ring_buffer target of the `system_health` Extended Events session, which is enabled and active by default in SQL Server. Consider the following query:

```sql
WITH cteDeadLocks ([Deadlock_XML]) AS (
  SELECT [Deadlock_XML] = CAST(target_data AS XML) 
  FROM sys.dm_xe_sessions AS xs
  INNER JOIN sys.dm_xe_session_targets AS xst 
  ON xs.[address] = xst.event_session_address
  WHERE xs.[name] = 'system_health'
  AND xst.target_name = 'ring_buffer'
 )
SELECT 
  Deadlock_XML = x.Graph.query('(event/data/value/deadlock)[1]')  
, when_occurred = x.Graph.value('(event/data/value/deadlock/process-list/process/@lastbatchstarted)[1]', 'datetime2(3)') 
, DB = DB_Name(x.Graph.value('(event/data/value/deadlock/process-list/process/@currentdb)[1]', 'int')) --Current database of the first listed process 
FROM (
 SELECT Graph.query('.') AS Graph 
 FROM cteDeadLocks c
 CROSS APPLY c.[Deadlock_XML].nodes('RingBufferTarget/event[@name="xml_deadlock_report"]') AS Deadlock_Report(Graph)
) AS x
ORDER BY when_occurred desc;
```

You can view the XML in the `Deadlock_XML` column inside SSMS, by selecting the cell that will appear as a hyperlink. Save this output as a `.xdl` file, close, then re-open the `.xdl` file in SSMS for visual deadlock graph. Your deadlock graph should look something like the following image.
