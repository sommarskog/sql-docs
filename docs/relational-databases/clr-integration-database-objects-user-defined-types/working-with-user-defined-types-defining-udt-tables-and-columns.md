# Working with User-Defined Types - Defining UDT Tables and Columns
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  Once the assembly containing the user-defined type (UDT) definition has been registered in a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database, it can be used in a column definition. For more information, see [CREATE TYPE (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/create-type-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Creating Tables with UDTs  
 There is no special syntax for creating a UDT column in a table. You can use the name of the UDT in a column definition as though it were one of the intrinsic [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data types. The following CREATE TABLE [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement creates a table named **Points**, with a column named **ID,** which is defined as an **int** identity column and the primary key for the table. The second column is named **PointValue**, with a data type of **Point**. The schema name used in this example is **dbo**. Note that you must have the necessary permissions to specify a schema name. If you omit the schema name, the default schema for the database user is used.  
  
```sql  
CREATE TABLE dbo.Points   
(ID int IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY, PointValue Point)  
```  
  
## Creating Indexes on UDT Columns  
 There are two options for indexing a UDT column:  
  
-   **Index the full value.** In this case, if the UDT is binary ordered, you can create an index over the entire UDT column by using the CREATE INDEX [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement.  
  
-   **Index UDT expressions.** You can create indexes on persisted computed columns over UDT expressions. The UDT expression can be a field, method, or property of a UDT. The expression must be deterministic and must not perform data access.  
  
 For more information, see [CREATE INDEX &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-index-transact-sql.md).
