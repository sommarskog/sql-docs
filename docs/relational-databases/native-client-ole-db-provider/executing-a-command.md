# Executing a SQL Server Native Client Command
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  After the connection to a data source is established, the consumer calls the **IDBCreateSession::CreateSession** method to create a session. The session acts as a command, rowset, or transaction factory.  
  
 To work directly with individual tables or indexes, the consumer requests the **IOpenRowset** interface. The **IOpenRowset::OpenRowset** method opens and returns a rowset that includes all rows from a single base table or index.  
  
 To execute a command (such as SELECT \* FROM Authors), the consumer requests the **IDBCreateCommand** interface. The consumer can execute the **IDBCreateCommand::CreateCommand** method to create a command object and request for the **ICommandText** interface. The **ICommandText::SetCommandText** method is used to specify the command that is to be executed.  
  
 The **Execute** command is used to execute the command. The command can be any SQL statement or procedure name. Not all commands produce a result set (rowset) object. Commands such as SELECT * FROM Authors produce a result set.
