# Change Tracking tables (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  Change Tracking is a lightweight solution that provides an efficient data change tracking mechanism for applications, ETL processes, event capture, and auditing. This allows for quick and simple detection of changed data without the need for expensive and complex custom solutions traditionally involving a combination of triggers, timestamp columns, new tables to store tracking information, and cleanup processes.
  
## In This Section

 [dbo.MSchange_tracking_history](../../relational-databases/system-tables/dbo-mschange-tracking-history-transact-sql.md)
