# restorefile (Transact-SQL)

  Contains one row for each restored file, including files restored indirectly by filegroup name. This table is stored in the **msdb** database.

|**file_number**|**numeric(10,0)**|File identification number of the restored file. This number must be unique within each database. Can be NULL.<br /><br /> When a database is reverted to a database snapshot, this value is populated in the same way as for a full restore.|  
|**destination_phys_drive**|**nvarchar(260)**|Drive or partition to which the file was restored. Can be NULL.<br /><br /> When a database is reverted to a database snapshot, this value is populated in the same way as for a full restore.|
