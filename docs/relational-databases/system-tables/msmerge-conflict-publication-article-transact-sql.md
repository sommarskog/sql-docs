# MSmerge_conflict_publication_article (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  The **MSmerge_conflict_publication_article** table contains information on rows that conflicted or row changes that were undone to achieve data convergence. A conflict table exists for each replicated table in a publication, where the name of the conflict table is appended with the publication and article name. These article-specific conflict tables exist in the database used for conflict logging, usually the publication database but can be the subscription database if there is decentralized conflict logging.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**_article\_column\_name_**|**variable**|Represents a column in a replicated table. This system table contains one column for each column in the table article.|  
|**rowguid**|**uniqueidentifier**|The row identifier for the conflict row.|  
|**ModifiedDate**|**datetime**|The time when the conflict occurred.|  
|**origin\_datasource\_id**|**uniqueidentifier**|The subscription for which the row change was undone or that lost the conflict.|
