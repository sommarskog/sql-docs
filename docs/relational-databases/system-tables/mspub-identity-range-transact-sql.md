[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  The **MSpub_identity_range** table provides identity range management support. This table is stored in the publication and subscription database.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**objid**|**int**|The ID of the table that has the identity column being managed by replication.|  
|**range**|**bigint**|Controls the range size of the consecutive identity values that would be assigned at the subscription in an adjustment.|  
|**pub_range**|**bigint**|Controls the range size of the consecutive identity values that would be assigned at the publication in an adjustment.|  
|**current_pub_range**|**bigint**|The current range being used by the publication. It can be different than *pub_range* if viewed after being changed by **sp_changearticle** and before the next range adjustment.|  
|**threshold**|**int**|The percentage value that controls when the Distribution Agent assigns a new identity range. When the percentage of values specified in *threshold* is used, the Distribution Agent creates a new identity range.|  
|**last_seed**|**bigint**|The lower bound of the current range.|
