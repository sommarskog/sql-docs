# dbo.syssessions (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Each time [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent starts, it creates a new session. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent uses sessions to preserve the status of jobs when the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service is restarted or stopped unexpectedly. Each row of the **syssessions** table contains information about one session. Use the **sysjobactivity** table to view the job state at the end of each session.  
  
 This table is stored in the **msdb** database.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**session_id**|**int**|ID of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent session. This session_id is not the SPID for the session, but rather an IDENTITY value within this system table.|  
|**agent_start_date**|**datetime**|Date and time that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service was started for this session.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Only users who are members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can access this table.
