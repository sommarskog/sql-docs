  Contains one row for each logical folder in the folder hierarchy that [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] uses. These folders are listed in Object Explorer of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] when you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)].
