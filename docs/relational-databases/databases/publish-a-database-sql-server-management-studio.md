  You can use the **Generate and Publish Scripts Wizard** to publish an entire database or individual database objects to a Web hosting provider.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The functionality described in this topic used to be provided by the Publish Database Wizard. The publishing functionality has been added to the Generate and Publish Scripts Wizard, and the Publish Database Wizard has been discontinued.
