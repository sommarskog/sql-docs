# Migrating Triggers
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  This topic discusses DDL triggers and memory-optimized tables.  
  
 DML triggers are supported on memory-optimized tables, but only with the FOR | AFTER trigger event. For an example see [Implementing UPDATE with FROM or Subqueries](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/implementing-update-with-from-or-subqueries.md). 
  
 LOGON triggers are triggers defined to fire on LOGON events. LOGON triggers do not affect memory-optimized tables.  
  
## DDL Triggers  
 DDL triggers are triggers defined to fire when a CREATE, ALTER, DROP, GRANT, DENY, REVOKE, or UPDATE STATISTICS statement is executed on the database or server on which it is defined.  
  
 You cannot create memory-optimized tables if the database or server has one or more DDL trigger defined on CREATE_TABLE or any event group that includes it. You cannot drop a memory-optimized table if the database or server has one or more DDL trigger defined on DROP_TABLE or any event group that includes it.  
  
 You cannot create natively compiled stored procedures if there are one or more DDL triggers on CREATE_PROCEDURE, DROP_PROCEDURE, or any event group that includes those events.
