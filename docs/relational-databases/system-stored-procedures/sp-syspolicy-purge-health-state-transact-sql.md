# sp_syspolicy_purge_health_state (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Deletes the policy health states in Policy-Based Management. Policy health states are visual indicators within Object Explorer (a scroll symbol with a red "X") that help you to determine which nodes have failed a policy evaluation.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_syspolicy_purge_health_state
    [ @target_tree_root_with_id = ] 'target_tree_root_with_id'
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @target_tree_root_with_id = ] '*target_tree_root_with_id*'

Represents the node in Object Explorer where you want to clear the health state. *@target_tree_root_with_id* is **nvarchar(400)**, with a default of NULL.

You can specify values from the target_query_expression_with_id column of the `msdb.dbo.syspolicy_system_health_state` system view.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Remarks

You must run `sp_syspolicy_purge_health_state` in the context of the `msdb` system database.

If you run this stored procedure without any parameters, the system health state is deleted for all nodes in Object Explorer.

## Permissions

Requires membership in the **PolicyAdministratorRole** fixed database role.

[!INCLUDE [policy-administrator-role](includes/policy-administrator-role.md)]

## Examples

The following example deletes the health states for a specific node in Object Explorer.

```sql
EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_syspolicy_purge_health_state
    @target_tree_root_with_id = 'Server/Database[@ID=7]';
GO
```
