# sp_reinitmergesubscription (Transact-SQL)

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_reinitmergesubscription [ [ @publication = ] 'publication'  
    [ , [ @subscriber = ] 'subscriber'  
    [ , [ @subscriber_db = ] 'subscriber_db'  
    [ , [ @upload_first = ] 'upload_first'  
```  
  
## Arguments  
`[ @publication = ] 'publication'`
 Is the name of the publication. *publication* is **sysname**, with a default of **all**.  
  
`[ @subscriber = ] 'subscriber'`
 Is the name of the Subscriber. *subscriber* is **sysname**, with a default of **all**.  
  
`[ @subscriber_db = ] 'subscriber_db'`
 Is the name of the Subscriber database. *subscriber_db* is **sysname**, with a default of **all**.  
  
`[ @upload_first = ] 'upload_first'`
 Is whether changes at the Subscriber are uploaded before the subscription is reinitialized. *upload_first* is **nvarchar(5)**, with a default of FALSE. If **true**, changes are uploaded before the subscription is reinitialized. If **false**, changes are not uploaded.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_reinitmergesubscription** is used in merge replication.  
  
 **sp_reinitmergesubscription** can be called from the Publisher to reinitialize merge subscriptions. We recommend re-running the Snapshot Agent as well.  
  
 If you add, drop, or change a parameterized filter, pending changes at the Subscriber cannot be uploaded to the Publisher during reinitialization. If you want to upload pending changes, synchronize all subscriptions before changing the filter.  
  
## Examples  

### A. Reinitialize the push subscription and lose pending changes

 [!code-sql[HowTo#sp_reinitmergepushsub](../../relational-databases/replication/codesnippet/tsql/sp-reinitmergesubscripti_1.sql)]  
  
### B. Reinitialize the push subscription and upload pending changes
 [!code-sql[HowTo#sp_reinitmergepushsubwithupload](../../relational-databases/replication/codesnippet/tsql/sp-reinitmergesubscripti_2.sql)]  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role or the **db_owner** fixed database role can execute **sp_reinitmergesubscription**.
