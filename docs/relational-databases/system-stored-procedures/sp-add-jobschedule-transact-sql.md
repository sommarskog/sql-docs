[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - ASDBMI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

Creates a schedule for a SQL Server Agent job.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_add_jobschedule
    [ @job_id = ] job_id
        | [ @job_name = ] N'job_name'
    , [ @name = ] N'name'
    [ , [ @enabled = ] enabled_flag ]
    [ , [ @freq_type = ] frequency_type ]
    [ , [ @freq_interval = ] frequency_interval ]
    [ , [ @freq_subday_type = ] frequency_subday_type ]
    [ , [ @freq_subday_interval = ] frequency_subday_interval ]
    [ , [ @freq_relative_interval = ] frequency_relative_interval ]
    [ , [ @freq_recurrence_factor = ] frequency_recurrence_factor ]
    [ , [ @active_start_date = ] active_start_date ]
    [ , [ @active_end_date = ] active_end_date ]
    [ , [ @active_start_time = ] active_start_time ]
    [ , [ @active_end_time = ] active_end_time ]
    [ , [ @schedule_id = ] schedule_id OUTPUT ]
    [ , [ @schedule_uid = ] _schedule_uid OUTPUT ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @job_id = ] *job_id*

Job identification number of the job to which the schedule is added. *@job_id* is **uniqueidentifier**, with no default.

Either *@job_id* or *@job_name* must be specified, but both can't be specified.

#### [ @job_name = ] N'*job_name*'

Name of the job to which the schedule is added. *@job_name* is **nvarchar(128)**, with no default.

Either *@job_id* or *@job_name* must be specified, but both can't be specified.

#### [ @name = ] N'*name*'

Name of the schedule. *name* is **nvarchar(128)**, with no default.

#### [ @enabled = ] *enabled_flag*

Indicates the current status of the schedule. *@enabled* is **tinyint**, with a default of `1` (enabled). If `0`, the schedule isn't enabled. When the schedule is disabled, the job doesn't be run.

#### [ @freq_type = ] *frequency_type*

Value that indicates when the job is to be executed. *@freq_type* is **int**, with a default of `0`, and can be one of the following values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `1` | Once |
| `4` | Daily |
| `8` | Weekly |
| `16` | Monthly |
| `32` | Monthly, relative to *freq_interval*. |
| `64` | Run when the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service starts. |
| `128` | Run when the computer is idle. |

#### [ @freq_interval = ] *frequency_interval*

Day that the job is executed. *@freq_interval* is **int**, with a default of `0`, and depends on the value of *@freq_type* as indicated in the following table:

| Value | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `1` (once) | *@freq_interval* is unused. |
| `4` (daily) | Every *@freq_interval* days. |
| `8` (weekly) | *@freq_interval* is one or more of the following (combined with an `OR` logical operator):<br /><br />1 = Sunday<br />2 = Monday<br />4 = Tuesday<br />8 = Wednesday<br />16 = Thursday<br />32 = Friday<br />64 = Saturday |
| `16` (monthly) | On the *@freq_interval* day of the month. |
| `32` (monthly relative) | *@freq_interval* is one of the following:<br /><br />1 = Sunday<br />2 = Monday<br />3 = Tuesday<br />4 = Wednesday<br />5 = Thursday<br />6 = Friday<br />7 = Saturday<br />8 = Day<br />9 = Weekday<br />10 = Weekend day |
| `64` (when the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service starts) | *@freq_interval* is unused. |
| `128` | *@freq_interval* is unused. |

#### [ @freq_subday_type = ] *frequency_subday_type*

Specifies the units for *@freq_subday_interval*. *@freq_subday_type* is **int**, with no default, and can be one of the following values:

| Value | Description (unit) |
| --- | --- |
| `0x1` | At the specified time |
| `0x2` | Seconds |
| `0x4` | Minutes |
| `0x8` | Hours |

#### [ @freq_subday_interval = ] *frequency_subday_interval*

Number of *@freq_subday_type* periods to occur between each execution of the job. *@freq_subday_interval* is **int**, with a default of `0`.

#### [ @freq_relative_interval = ] *frequency_relative_interval*

Further defines the *@freq_interval* when *@freq_type* is set to `32` (monthly relative).

*@freq_relative_interval* is **int**, with no default, and can be one of the following values:

| Value | Description (unit) |
| --- | --- |
| `1` | First |
| `2` | Second |
| `4` | Third |
| `8` | Fourth |
| `16` | Last |

*@freq_relative_interval* indicates the occurrence of the interval. For example, if *@freq_relative_interval* is set to `2`, *@freq_type* is set to `32`, and *@freq_interval* is set to `3`, the scheduled job would occur on the second Tuesday of each month.

#### [ @freq_recurrence_factor = ] *frequency_recurrence_factor*

Number of weeks or months between the scheduled execution of the job. *@freq_recurrence_factor* is used only if *@freq_type* is set to `8`, `16`, or `32`. *@freq_recurrence_factor* is **int**, with a default of `0`.

#### [ @active_start_date = ] *active_start_date*

Date on which job execution can begin. *@active_start_date* is **int**, with no default. The date is formatted as `yyyyMMdd`. If *@active_start_date* is set, the date must be greater than or equal to `19900101`.

After the schedule is created, review the start date and confirm that it is the correct date. For more information, see the section "Scheduling Start Date" in [Create and Attach Schedules to Jobs](../../ssms/agent/create-and-attach-schedules-to-jobs.md).

#### [ @active_end_date = ] *active_end_date*

Date on which job execution can stop. *@active_end_date* is **int**, with no default. The date is formatted as `yyyyMMdd`.

#### [ @active_start_time = ] *active_start_time*

Time on any day between *@active_start_date* and *@active_end_date* to begin job execution. *@active_start_time* is **int**, with no default. The time is formatted as `HHmmss` on a 24-hour clock.

#### [ @active_end_time = ] *active_end_time*

Time on any day between *active_start_date* and *@active_end_date* to end job execution. *@active_end_time* is **int**, with no default. The time is formatted as `HHmmss` on a 24-hour clock.

#### [ @schedule_id = ] *schedule_id* OUTPUT

Schedule identification number assigned to the schedule if it is created successfully. *@schedule_id* is an output variable of type **int**, with no default.

#### [ @schedule_uid = ] *_schedule_uid* OUTPUT

A unique identifier for the schedule. *@schedule_uid* is a variable of type **uniqueidentifier**.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Result sets

None.

## Remarks

Job schedules can now be managed independently of jobs. To add a schedule to a job, use `sp_add_schedule` to create the schedule and `sp_attach_schedule` to attach the schedule to a job.

## Permissions

[!INCLUDE [msdb-execute-permissions](../../includes/msdb-execute-permissions.md)]

Other users must be granted one of the following [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent fixed database roles in the `msdb` database:

- **SQLAgentUserRole**
- **SQLAgentReaderRole**
- **SQLAgentOperatorRole**

For details about the permissions of these roles, see [SQL Server Agent Fixed Database Roles](../../ssms/agent/sql-server-agent-fixed-database-roles.md).

## Example

The following example assigns a job schedule to `SaturdayReports`, which executes every Saturday at 2:00 AM.

```sql
EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_add_jobschedule
    @job_name = N'SaturdayReports', -- Job name
    @name = N'Weekly_Sat_2AM', -- Schedule name
    @freq_type = 8, -- Weekly
    @freq_interval = 64, -- Saturday
    @freq_recurrence_factor = 1, -- every week
    @active_start_time = 20000 -- 2:00 AM
```
