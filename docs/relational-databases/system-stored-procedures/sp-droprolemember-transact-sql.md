## Syntax  

### Syntax for both SQL Server and Azure SQL Database

```syntaxsql  
sp_droprolemember [ @rolename = ] 'role' ,   
     [ @membername = ] 'security_account'  
```  

### Syntax for both Azure Synapse Analytics and Parallel Data Warehouse

```syntaxsql  
sp_droprolemember 'role' ,  
     'security_account'  
```  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax](../../includes/synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax.md)]
  
## Arguments  
`[ @rolename = ] 'role'`
 Is the name of the role from which the member is being removed. *role* is **sysname**, with no default. *role* must exist in the current database.  
  
`[ @membername = ] 'security_account'`
 Is the name of the security account being removed from the role. *security_account* is **sysname**, with no default. *security_account* can be a database user, another database role, a Windows login, or a Windows group. *security_account* must exist in the current database.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 0 (success) or 1 (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 sp_droprolemember removes a member from a database role by deleting a row from the sysmembers table. When a member is removed from a role the member loses any permissions it has by membership in that role.  
  
 To remove a user from a fixed server role, use sp_dropsrvrolemember. Users cannot be removed from the public role, and dbo cannot be removed from any role.  
  
 Use sp_helpuser to see the members of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] role, and use ALTER ROLE to add a member to a role.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires ALTER permission on the role.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example removes the user `JonB` from the role `Sales`.  
  
```sql
EXEC sp_droprolemember 'Sales', 'Jonb';  
```  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
 The following example removes the user `JonB` from the role `Sales`.  
  
```sql
EXEC sp_droprolemember 'Sales', 'JonB'  
```
