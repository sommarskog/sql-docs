# sp_check_dynamic_filters (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

Displays information on parameterized row filter properties for a publication, in particular the functions used to generate a filtered data partition for a publication and whether the publication qualifies for using precomputed partitions. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database.

## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql  
sp_check_dynamic_filters [ @publication = ] 'publication'  
```  
  
## Arguments  
`[ @publication = ] 'publication'`
 Is the name of the publication. *publication* is **sysname**, with no default.  
  
## Result Sets  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**can_use_partition_groups**|**bit**|Is if the publication qualifies for using precomputed partitions; where **1** means that precomputed partitions can be used, and **0** means that they cannot be used.|  
|**has_dynamic_filters**|**bit**|Is if at least one parameterized row filter has been defined in the publication; where **1** means that one or more parameterized row filters exist, and **0** means that no dynamic filters exist.|  
|**dynamic_filters_function_list**|**nvarchar(500)**|List of functions used to filter articles in a publication, where each function is separated by a semi-colon.|  
|**validate_subscriber_info**|**nvarchar(500)**|List of functions used to filter articles in a publication, where each function is separated by a plus sign (+).|  
|**uses_host_name**|**bit**|If the [HOST_NAME()](../../t-sql/functions/host-name-transact-sql.md) function is used in parameterized row filters, where **1** means that this function is used for dynamic filtering.|  
|**uses_suser_sname**|**bit**|If the [SUSER_SNAME()](../../t-sql/functions/suser-sname-transact-sql.md) function is used in parameterized row filters, where **1** means that this function is used for dynamic filtering.|  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_check_dynamic_filters** is used in merge replication.  
  
 If a publication has been defined to use precomputed partitions, **sp_check_dynamic_filters** checks for any violations of the restrictions of precomputed partitions. If any are found, an error is returned. For more information, see [Optimize Parameterized Filter Performance with Precomputed Partitions](../../relational-databases/replication/merge/parameterized-filters-optimize-for-precomputed-partitions.md).  
  
 If a publication has been defined as having parameterized row filters, but no parameterized row filters are found, an error is returned.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role or **db_owner** fixed database role can execute **sp_check_dynamic_filters**.
