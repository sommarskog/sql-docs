## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_add_log_shipping_secondary_database
    [ @secondary_database = ] 'secondary_database'
    , [ @primary_server = ] 'primary_server'
    , [ @primary_database = ] 'primary_database'
    [ , [ @restore_delay = ] 'restore_delay' ]
    [ , [ @restore_all = ] 'restore_all' ]
    [ , [ @restore_mode = ] 'restore_mode' ]
    [ , [ @disconnect_users = ] 'disconnect_users' ]
    [ , [ @block_size = ] 'block_size' ]
    [ , [ @buffer_count = ] 'buffer_count' ]
    [ , [ @max_transfer_size = ] 'max_transfer_size' ]
    [ , [ @restore_threshold = ] 'restore_threshold' ]
    [ , [ @threshold_alert = ] 'threshold_alert' ]
    [ , [ @threshold_alert_enabled = ] 'threshold_alert_enabled' ]
    [ , [ @history_retention_period = ] 'history_retention_period' ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @secondary_database = ] '*secondary_database*'

The name of the secondary database. *@secondary_database* is **sysname**, with no default.

#### [ @primary_server = ] '*primary_server*'

The name of the primary instance of the [!INCLUDE [ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] in the log shipping configuration. *@primary_server* is **sysname** and can't be NULL.

#### [ @primary_database = ] '*primary_database*'

The name of the database on the primary server. *@primary_database* is **sysname**, with no default.

#### [ @restore_delay = ] '*restore_delay*'

The amount of time, in minutes, that the secondary server waits before restoring a given backup file. *@restore_delay* is **int** and can't be NULL. The default value is 0.

#### [ @restore_all = ] '*restore_all*'

If set to 1, the secondary server restores all available transaction log backups when the restore job runs. Otherwise, it stops after one file is restored. *@restore_all* is **bit** and can't be NULL.

#### [ @restore_mode = ] '*restore_mode*'

The restore mode for the secondary database.

- `0`: Restore log with `NORECOVERY`
- `1`: restore log with `STANDBY`

*@restore_mode* is **bit** and can't be NULL.

#### [ @disconnect_users = ] '*disconnect_users*'

If set to `1`, users are disconnected from the secondary database when a restore operation is performed. The default is `0`. *@disconnect_users* is **bit** and can't be NULL.

#### [ @block_size = ] '*block_size*'

The size, in bytes, used as the block size for the backup device. *@block_size* is **int** with a default value of -1.

#### [ @buffer_count = ] '*buffer_count*'

The total number of buffers used by the backup or restore operation. *@buffer_count* is **int** with a default value of -1.

#### [ @max_transfer_size = ] '*max_transfer_size*'

The size, in bytes, of the maximum input or output request that is issued by [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to the backup device. *@max_transfersize* is **int** and can be NULL.

#### [ @restore_threshold = ] '*restore_threshold*'

The number of minutes allowed to elapse between restore operations before an alert is generated. *@restore_threshold* is **int** and can't be NULL.

#### [ @threshold_alert = ] '*threshold_alert*'

The alert to be raised when the backup threshold is exceeded. *@threshold_alert* is **int**, with a default of 14,420.

#### [ @threshold_alert_enabled = ] '*threshold_alert_enabled*'

Specifies whether an alert is raised when *@restore_threshold* is exceeded. A value of `1` (the default) means that the alert is raised. *@threshold_alert_enabled* is **bit**.

#### [ @history_retention_period = ] '*@history_retention_period*'

The length of time in minutes in which the history is retained. *@history_retention_period* is **int**, with a default of NULL. A value of 14420 is used if none is specified.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Result sets

None.

## Remarks

`sp_add_log_shipping_secondary_database` must be run from the `master` database on the secondary server. This stored procedure does the following:

1. `sp_add_log_shipping_secondary_primary` should be called prior to this stored procedure to initialize the primary log shipping database information on the secondary server.

1. Adds an entry for the secondary database in `log_shipping_secondary_databases` using the supplied arguments.

1. Adds a local monitor record in `log_shipping_monitor_secondary` on the secondary server using supplied arguments.

1. If the monitor server is different from the secondary server, `sp_add_log_shipping_secondary_database` adds a monitor record in `log_shipping_monitor_secondary` on the monitor server using supplied arguments.

## Permissions

Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can run this procedure.

## Examples

This example illustrates using the `sp_add_log_shipping_secondary_database` stored procedure to add the database `LogShipAdventureWorks` as a secondary database in a log shipping configuration with the primary database [!INCLUDE [ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] residing on the primary server `TRIBECA`.

```sql
EXEC master.dbo.sp_add_log_shipping_secondary_database
    @secondary_database = N'LogShipAdventureWorks',
    @primary_server = N'TRIBECA',
    @primary_database = N'AdventureWorks2022',
    @restore_delay = 0,
    @restore_mode = 1,
    @disconnect_users = 0,
    @restore_threshold = 45,
    @threshold_alert_enabled = 0,
    @history_retention_period = 1440;
GO
```
