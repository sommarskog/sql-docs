 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_releaseapplock [ @Resource = ] 'resource_name'   
     [ , [ @LockOwner = ] 'lock_owner' ]  
     [ , [ @DbPrincipal = ] 'database_principal' ]  
[ ; ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ @Resource= ] '*resource_name*'  
 Is a lock resource name specified by the client application. The application must ensure that the resource is unique. The specified name is hashed internally into a value that can be stored in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] lock manager. *resource_name* is **nvarchar(255)** with no default. *resource_name* is binary compared, thus is case-sensitive regardless of the collation settings of the current database.  
  
 [ @LockOwner= ] '*lock_owner*'  
 Is the owner of the lock, which is the *lock_owner* value when the lock was requested. *lock_owner* is **nvarchar(32)**. The value can be **Transaction** (the default) or **Session**. When the *lock_owner* value is **Transaction**, by default or specified explicitly, sp_getapplock must be executed from within a transaction.  
  
 [ @DbPrincipal= ] '*database_principal*'  
 Is the user, role, or application role that has permissions to an object in a database. The caller of the function must be a member of *database_principal*, dbo, or the db_owner fixed database role in order to call the function successfully. The default is public.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 \>= 0 (success), or < 0 (failure)  
  
|Value|Result|  
|-----------|------------|  
|0|Lock was successfully released.|  
|-999|Indicates parameter validation or other call error.|  
  
## Remarks  
 When an application calls sp_getapplock multiple times for the same lock resource, sp_releaseapplock must be called the same number of times to release the lock.  
  
 When the server shuts down for any reason, the locks are released.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires membership in the public role.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example releases the lock associated with the current transaction on the resource `Form1` in the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
GO  
EXEC sp_getapplock @DbPrincipal = 'dbo', @Resource = 'Form1',   
     @LockMode = 'Shared';  
EXEC sp_releaseapplock @DbPrincipal = 'dbo', @Resource = 'Form1';  
GO  
```
