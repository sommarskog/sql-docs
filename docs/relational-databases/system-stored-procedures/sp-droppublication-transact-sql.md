# sp_droppublication (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

  Drops a publication and its associated Snapshot Agent. All subscriptions must be dropped before dropping a publication. The articles in the publication are dropped automatically. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_droppublication [ @publication= ] 'publication'   
    [ , [ @ignore_distributor = ] ignore_distributor ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
`[ @publication = ] 'publication'`

`[ @ignore_distributor = ] ignore_distributor`
 [!INCLUDE[ssInternalOnly](../../includes/ssinternalonly-md.md)]  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_droppublication** is used in snapshot replication and transactional replication.  
  
 **sp_droppublication** recursively drops all articles associated with a publication and then drops the publication itself. A publication cannot be removed if it has one or more subscriptions to it. For information about how to remove subscriptions, see [Delete a Push Subscription](../../relational-databases/replication/delete-a-push-subscription.md) and [Delete a Pull Subscription](../../relational-databases/replication/delete-a-pull-subscription.md).  
  
 Executing **sp_droppublication** to drop a publication does not remove published objects from the publication database or the corresponding objects from the subscription database. Use DROP \<object> to remove these objects manually if necessary.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can execute **sp_droppublication**.
