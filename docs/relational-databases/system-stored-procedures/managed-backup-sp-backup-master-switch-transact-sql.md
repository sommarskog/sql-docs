# managed_backup.sp_backup_master_switch (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016.md)]

Pauses or resumes the [!INCLUDE [ss_smartbackup](../../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)].

Use `managed_backup.sp_backup_master_switch` to temporarily pause and then resume [!INCLUDE [ss_smartbackup](../../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)]. This procedure makes sure that all the configurations settings remain, and are retained when the operations resume. When [!INCLUDE [ss_smartbackup](../../includes/ss-smartbackup-md.md)] is paused the retention period isn't enforced.

In other words, there's no check to determine:

- whether files should be deleted from storage
- if there are corrupted backup files
- if there's a break in the log chain.
