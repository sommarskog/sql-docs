[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

 :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_unsetapprole @cookie   
```  
  
## Arguments  
 **\@cookie**  
 Specifies the cookie that was created when the application role was activated. The cookie is created by [sp_setapprole &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-setapprole-transact-sql.md). **varbinary(8000)**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The cookie **OUTPUT** parameter for **sp_setapprole** is currently documented as **varbinary(8000)** which is the correct maximum length. However the current implementation returns **varbinary(50)**. Applications should continue to reserve **varbinary(8000)** so that the application continues to operate correctly if the cookie return size increases in a future release.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 0 (success) and 1 (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 After an application role is activated by using **sp_setapprole**, the role remains active until the user either disconnects from the server or executes **sp_unsetapprole**.  
  
 For an overview of application roles, see [Application Roles](../../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/application-roles.md).  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires membership in **public** and knowledge of the cookie saved when the application role was activated.  
  
## Examples  
  
### Activating an application role with a cookie, then reverting to the previous context  
 The following example activates the `Sales11` application role with password `fdsd896#gfdbfdkjgh700mM`, and creates a cookie. The example returns the name of the current user, and then reverts to the original context by executing **sp_unsetapprole**.  
  
```  
DECLARE @cookie varbinary(8000);  
EXEC sp_setapprole 'Sales11', 'fdsd896#gfdbfdkjgh700mM'  
    , @fCreateCookie = true, @cookie = @cookie OUTPUT;  
-- The application role is now active.  
SELECT USER_NAME();  
-- This will return the name of the application role, Sales11.  
EXEC sp_unsetapprole @cookie;  
-- The application role is no longer active.  
-- The original context has now been restored.  
GO  
SELECT USER_NAME();  
-- This will return the name of the original user.   
GO   
```
