> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_add_job [ @job_name = ] N'job_name'
     [ , [ @enabled = ] enabled ]
     [ , [ @description = ] N'description' ]
     [ , [ @start_step_id = ] step_id ]
     [ , [ @category_name = ] 'category' ]
     [ , [ @category_id = ] category_id ]
     [ , [ @owner_login_name = ] 'login' ]
     [ , [ @notify_level_eventlog = ] eventlog_level ]
     [ , [ @notify_level_email = ] email_level ]
     [ , [ @notify_level_netsend = ] netsend_level ]
     [ , [ @notify_level_page = ] page_level ]
     [ , [ @notify_email_operator_name = ] 'email_name' ]
     [ , [ @notify_netsend_operator_name = ] 'netsend_name' ]
     [ , [ @notify_page_operator_name = ] 'page_name' ]
     [ , [ @delete_level = ] delete_level ]
     [ , [ @job_id = ] job_id OUTPUT ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @job_name = ] N'*job_name*'

The name of the job. The name must be unique and can't contain the percent (`%`) character. *@job_name* is **nvarchar(128)**, with no default.

#### [ @enabled = ] *enabled*

Indicates the status of the added job. *enabled* is **tinyint**, with a default of `1` (enabled). If `0`, the job isn't enabled and doesn't run according to its schedule; however, it can be run manually.

#### [ @description = ] N'*description*'

The description of the job. *@description* is **nvarchar(512)**, with a default of NULL. If *@description* is omitted, `N'No description available'` is used.

#### [ @start_step_id = ] *step_id*

The identification number of the first step to execute for the job. *@start_step_id* is **int**, with a default of `1`.

#### [ @category_name = ] '*category*'

The category for the job. *@category_name* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.

#### [ @category_id = ] *category_id*

A language-independent mechanism for specifying a job category. *@category_id* is **int**, with a default of NULL.

#### [ @owner_login_name = ] '*login*'

The name of the login that owns the job. *@owner_login_name* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL, which is interpreted as the current login name. Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can set or change the value for *@owner_login_name*. If users who aren't members of the **sysadmin** role set or change the value of *@owner_login_name*, execution of this stored procedure fails and an error is returned.

#### [ @notify_level_eventlog = ] *eventlog_level*

A value indicating when to place an entry in the Microsoft Windows application log for this job. *@notify_level_eventlog* is **int**, and can be one of these values.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Never |
| `1` | On success |
| `2` (default) | On failure |
| `3` | Always |

#### [ @notify_level_email = ] *email_level*

A value that indicates when to send an e-mail upon the completion of this job. *@notify_level_email* is **int**, with a default of `0`, which indicates never. *@notify_level_email* uses the same values as *@notify_level_eventlog*.

#### [ @notify_level_netsend = ] *netsend_level*

A value that indicates when to send a network message upon the completion of this job. *@notify_level_netsend* is **int**, with a default of `0`, which indicates never. *@notify_level_netsend* uses the same values as *@notify_level_eventlog*.

#### [ @notify_level_page = ] *page_level*

A value that indicates when to send a page upon the completion of this job. *@notify_level_page* is **int**, with a default of `0`, which indicates never. *@notify_level_page* uses the same values as *@notify_level_eventlog*.

#### [ @notify_email_operator_name = ] '*email_name*'

The e-mail name of the person to send e-mail to when *@notify_email_operator_name* is reached. *@notify_email_operator_name* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.

#### [ @notify_netsend_operator_name = ] '*netsend_name*'

The name of the operator to whom the network message is sent upon completion of this job. *@notify_netsend_operator_name* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.

#### [ @notify_page_operator_name = ] '*page_name*'

The name of the person to page upon completion of this job. *@notify_page_operator_name* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.

#### [ @delete_level = ] *delete_level*

A value that indicates when to delete the job. *delete_value* is **int**, with a default of `0`, which means never. *@delete_level* uses the same values as *@notify_level_eventlog*.

> [!NOTE]  
> When *@delete_level* is `3`, the job is executed only once, regardless of any schedules defined for the job. Furthermore, if a job deletes itself, all history for the job is also deleted.

#### [ @job_id = ] *job_id* OUTPUT

The job identification number assigned to the job if created successfully. *@job_id* is an output variable of type **uniqueidentifier**, with a default of NULL.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Result sets

None.

## Remarks

*@originating_server* exists in `sp_add_job`, but isn't listed under Arguments. *@originating_server* is reserved for internal use.

After `sp_add_job` has been executed to add a job, `sp_add_jobstep` can be used to add steps that perform the activities for the job. `sp_add_jobschedule` can be used to create the schedule that the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service uses to execute the job. Use `sp_add_jobserver` to set the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance where the job executes, and `sp_delete_jobserver` to remove the job from the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.

If the job executes on one or more target servers in a multiserver environment, use `sp_apply_job_to_targets` to set the target servers or target server groups for the job. To remove jobs from target servers or target server groups, use `sp_remove_job_from_targets`.

[!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] provides an easy, graphical way to manage jobs, and is the recommended way to create and manage the job infrastructure.

## Permissions

[!INCLUDE [msdb-execute-permissions](../../includes/msdb-execute-permissions.md)]

Other users must be granted one of the following [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent fixed database roles in the `msdb` database:

- **SQLAgentUserRole**
- **SQLAgentReaderRole**
- **SQLAgentOperatorRole**

For information about the specific permissions that are associated with each of these fixed database roles, see [SQL Server Agent Fixed Database Roles](../../ssms/agent/sql-server-agent-fixed-database-roles.md).

Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can set or change the value for *@owner_login_name*. If users who aren't members of the **sysadmin** role set or change the value of *@owner_login_name*, execution of this stored procedure fails and an error is returned.

## Examples

### A. Add a job

This example adds a new job named `NightlyBackups`.

```sql
USE msdb;
GO

EXEC dbo.sp_add_job @job_name = N'NightlyBackups';
GO
```

### B. Add a job with pager, e-mail, and net send information

This example creates a job named `Ad hoc Sales Data Backup` that notifies `François Ajenstat` (by pager, e-mail, or network pop-up message) if the job fails, and deletes the job upon successful completion.

> [!NOTE]  
> This example assumes that an operator named `François Ajenstat` and a login named `françoisa` already exist.

```sql
USE msdb;
GO

EXEC dbo.sp_add_job
    @job_name = N'Ad hoc Sales Data Backup',
    @enabled = 1,
    @description = N'Ad hoc backup of sales data',
    @owner_login_name = N'françoisa',
    @notify_level_eventlog = 2,
    @notify_level_email = 2,
    @notify_level_netsend = 2,
    @notify_level_page = 2,
    @notify_email_operator_name = N'François Ajenstat',
    @notify_netsend_operator_name = N'François Ajenstat',
    @notify_page_operator_name = N'François Ajenstat',
    @delete_level = 1;
GO
```
