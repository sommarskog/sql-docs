# sp_setreplfailovermode (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  Allows you to set the failover operation mode for subscriptions enabled for immediate updating with queued updating as failover. This stored procedure is executed at the Subscriber on the subscription database. For more information about failover modes, see [Updatable Subscriptions for Transactional Replication](../../relational-databases/replication/transactional/updatable-subscriptions-for-transactional-replication.md).

    [ , [ @publisher_db = ] 'publisher_db' ]  
    [ , [ @publication= ] 'publication' ]  
    [ , [ @failover_mode= ] 'failover_mode' ]  
    [ , [ @override = ] override ]  
```

 Is the failover mode for the subscription. *failover_mode* is **nvarchar(10)** and can be one of these values.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**immediate** or **sync**|Data modifications made at the Subscriber are bulk-copied to the Publisher as they occur.|
