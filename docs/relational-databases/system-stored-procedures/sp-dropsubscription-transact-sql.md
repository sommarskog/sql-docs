## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_dropsubscription [ [ @publication= ] 'publication' ]  
    [ , [ @article= ] 'article' ]  
        , [ @subscriber= ] 'subscriber'  
    [ , [ @destination_db= ] 'destination_db' ]  
    [ , [ @ignore_distributor = ] ignore_distributor ]  
    [ , [ @reserved= ] 'reserved' ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
`[ @publication = ] 'publication'`
 Is the name of the associated publication. *publication* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL. If **all**, all subscriptions for all publications for the specified Subscriber are canceled. *publication* is a required parameter.  
  
`[ @article = ] 'article'`
 Is the name of the article. *article* is **sysname**, with a default value of NULL. If **all**, subscriptions to all articles for each specified publication and Subscriber are dropped. Use **all** for publications that allow immediate updating.  
  
`[ @subscriber = ] 'subscriber'`
 Is the name of the Subscriber that will have its subscriptions dropped. *subscriber* is **sysname**, with no default. If **all**, all subscriptions for all Subscribers are dropped.  
  
`[ @destination_db = ] 'destination_db'`
 Is the name of the destination database. *destination_db* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL. If NULL, all the subscriptions from that Subscriber are dropped.  
  
`[ @ignore_distributor = ] ignore_distributor`

`[ @reserved = ] 'reserved'`

## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_dropsubscription** is used in snapshot and transactional replication.  
  
 If you drop the subscription on an article in an immediate-sync publication, you cannot add it back unless you drop the subscriptions on all the articles in the publication and add them all back at once.
