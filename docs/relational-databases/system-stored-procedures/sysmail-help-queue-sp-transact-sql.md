# sysmail_help_queue_sp (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

There are two queues in Database Mail: the mail queue and status queue. The mail queue stores mail items that are waiting to be sent. The status queue stores the status of items that have already been sent. This stored procedure allows viewing the state of the mail or status queues. If the parameter *@queue_type* isn't specified, the stored procedure returns one row for each of the queues.
