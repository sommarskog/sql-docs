## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_showrowreplicainfo [ [ @ownername = ] 'ownername' ]  
    [ , [ @tablename =] 'tablename' ]   
        , [ @rowguid =] rowguid   
    [ , [ @show = ] 'show' ]   
```  
  
## Arguments  
`[ @ownername = ] 'ownername'`
 Is the name of the table owner. *ownername* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL. This parameter is useful to differentiate tables if a database contains multiple tables with the same name, but each table has a different owner.  
  
`[ @tablename = ] 'tablename'`
 Is the name of the table that contains the row for which the information is returned. *tablename* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.  
  
`[ @rowguid = ] rowguid`
 Is the unique identifier of the row. *rowguid* is **uniqueidentifier**, with no default.  
  
`[ @show = ] 'show'`
 Determines the amount of information to return in the result set. *show* is **nvarchar(20)** with a default of BOTH. If **row**, only row version information is returned. If **columns**, only column version information is returned. If **both**, both row and column information is returned.
