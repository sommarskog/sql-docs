## Arguments  
`[ @login = ] 'login'`

`[ @password = ] 'password'`
 Is the system administrator password to use when creating new system objects in the Distribution database. *password* is **sysname**, with a default of **''** (empty string). This parameter is not required if *security_mode* is set to **1**, which is Windows Authentication.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This parameter is ignored when you are upgrading to SQL [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] and later versions.  
  
`[ @ver_old = ] 'old_version'`
 [!INCLUDE[ssInternalOnly](../../includes/ssinternalonly-md.md)]

`[ @force_remove = ] 'force_removal'`
 [!INCLUDE[ssInternalOnly](../../includes/ssinternalonly-md.md)]  
  
`[ @security_mode = ] 'security_mode'`
