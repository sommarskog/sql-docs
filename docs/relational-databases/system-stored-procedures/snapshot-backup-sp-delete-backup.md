## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sys.sp_delete_backup
    [ @backup_url = ] N'backup_metadata_file_url'
    , [ [ @db_name = ] N'database_name' | NULL ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @backup_url = ] N'*backup_meta_file_url*'

The URL of the backup to be deleted, which deletes all snapshots comprising the specified backup set including the backup file itself.

#### [ @db_name = ] N'*database_name*'

The name of the database containing the snapshot to be deleted. When a database name is provided, the system verifies that the backup URL provided is a backup URL for the specified database and uses [sp_delete_backup_file_snapshot (Transact-SQL)](snapshot-backup-sp-delete-backup-file-snapshot.md) to delete each snapshot. If no database name is provided, this database check is not performed.

## Permissions

Requires ALTER ANY DATABASE permission or ALTER permission on the specified database.
