## Arguments

#### [ @name = ] '*name*'

The name of an operator (notification recipient). This name must be unique and can't contain the percent (`%`) character. *@name* is **sysname**, with no default.

#### [ @enabled = ] *enabled*

Indicates the current status of the operator. *@enabled* is **tinyint**, with a default of `1` (enabled). If `0`, the operator isn't enabled and doesn't receive notifications.

#### [ @email_address = ] N'*email_address*'

The e-mail address of the operator. This string is passed directly to the e-mail system. *@email_address* is **nvarchar(100)**, with a default of NULL.

You can specify either a physical e-mail address or an alias for *@email_address*. For example:

`fatmir.bregu` or `fatmir.bregu@contoso.com`

> [!NOTE]  
> You must use the e-mail address for Database Mail.

#### [ @pager_address = ] N'*pager_address*'

The pager address of the operator. This string is passed directly to the e-mail system. *@pager_address* is **nvarchar(100)**, with a default of NULL.

#### [ @weekday_pager_start_time = ] *weekday_pager_start_time*

The time after which [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent sends pager notification to the specified operator on the weekdays, from Monday through Friday. *@weekday_pager_start_time* is **int**, with a default of `090000`, which indicates 9:00 A.M. on a 24-hour clock, and must be entered using the form `HHmmss`.

#### [ @weekday_pager_end_time = ] *weekday_pager_end_time*

The time after which [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service no longer sends pager notification to the specified operator on the weekdays, from Monday through Friday. *weekday_pager_end_time* is **int**, with a default of `180000`, which indicates 6:00 P.M. on a 24-hour clock, and must be entered using the form `HHmmss`.

#### [ @saturday_pager_start_time = ] *saturday_pager_start_time*

The time after which [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service sends pager notification to the specified operator on Saturdays. *saturday_pager_start_time* is **int**, with a default of `090000`, which indicates 9:00 A.M. on a 24-hour clock, and must be entered using the form `HHmmss`.

#### [ @saturday_pager_end_time = ] *saturday_pager_end_time*

The time after which [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service no longer sends pager notification to the specified operator on Saturdays. *@saturday_pager_end_time* is **int**, with a default of `180000`, which indicates 6:00 P.M. on a 24-hour clock, and must be entered using the form `HHmmss`.

#### [ @sunday_pager_start_time = ] *sunday_pager_start_time*

The time after which [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service sends pager notification to the specified operator on Sundays. *@sunday_pager_start_time* is **int**, with a default of `090000`, which indicates 9:00 A.M. on a 24-hour clock, and must be entered using the form `HHmmss`.

#### [ @sunday_pager_end_time = ] *sunday_pager_end_time*

The time after which [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service no longer sends pager notification to the specified operator on Sundays. *@sunday_pager_end_time* is **int**, with a default of `180000`, which indicates 6:00 P.M. on a 24-hour clock, and must be entered using the form `HHmmss`.

#### [ @pager_days = ] *pager_days*

A number that indicates the days that the operator is available for pages (subject to the specified start/end times). *@pager_days* is **tinyint**, with a default of `0` indicating the operator is never available to receive a page. Valid values are from `0` through `127`. *@pager_days* is calculated by adding the individual values for the required days. For example, from Monday through Friday is `2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 62`. The following table lists the value for each day of the week.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |

The name of the category for this operator. *@category_name* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Result sets

None.

## Remarks

`sp_add_operator` must be run from the `msdb` database.

Your e-mail system must have an e-mail-to-pager capability if you want to use paging.

[!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] provides an easy, graphical way to manage jobs, and is the recommended way to create and manage the job infrastructure.

## Permissions

[!INCLUDE [msdb-execute-permissions](../../includes/msdb-execute-permissions.md)]

## Examples

The following example sets up the operator information for `danwi`. The operator is enabled. [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent sends notifications by pager from Monday through Friday from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M.

```sql
USE msdb;
GO

EXEC dbo.sp_add_operator @name = N'Dan Wilson',
    @enabled = 1,
    @email_address = N'danwi',
    @pager_address = N'5551290AW@pager.adventure-works.com',
    @weekday_pager_start_time = 080000,
    @weekday_pager_end_time = 170000,
    @pager_days = 62;
GO
