# sp_fulltext_database (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

This is supported for backward compatibility only. `sp_fulltext_database` doesn't disable the Full-Text Engine for a given database. All user-created databases in [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are always enabled for full-text indexing.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE [ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)] Use [!INCLUDE [ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] instead.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_fulltext_database [ @action = ] 'action'
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @action = ] '*action*'

The action to be performed. *@action* is **varchar(20)**, and can be one of these values.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **enable** | Supported for backward compatibility only. It rebuilds all full-text catalogs of the database if the previous state of full-text is `disabled`. |
| **disable** | Supported for backward compatibility only. |

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Result sets

None.

## Remarks

In [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and later versions, full-text indexing can't be turned off. Disabling full-text indexing doesn't remove rows from `sysfulltextcatalogs` and doesn't indicate that full-text enabled tables are no longer marked for full-text indexing. All the full-text metadata definitions are still in the system tables.

## Permissions

Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role and **db_owner** fixed database role can execute `sp_fulltext_database`.
