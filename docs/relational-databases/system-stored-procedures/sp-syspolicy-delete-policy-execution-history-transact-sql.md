# sp_syspolicy_delete_policy_execution_history (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Deletes execution history for policies in Policy-Based Management. You can use this stored procedure to delete execution history for a specific policy or for all policies, and to delete execution history before a specific date.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_syspolicy_delete_policy_execution_history
    [ @policy_id = ] policy_id
    , [ @oldest_date = ] 'oldest_date'
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @policy_id = ] *policy_id*

The identifier of the policy for which you want to delete the execution history. *@policy_id* is **int**, and is required. Can be NULL.

#### [ @oldest_date = ] '*oldest_date*'

The oldest date for which you want to keep policy execution history. Any execution history earlier than this date is deleted. *@oldest_date* is **datetime**, and is required. Can be NULL.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Remarks

You must run `sp_syspolicy_delete_policy_execution_history` in the context of the `msdb` system database.

To obtain values for *@policy_id*, and to view execution history dates, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT a.name AS N'policy_name',
    b.policy_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date
FROM msdb.dbo.syspolicy_policies AS a
INNER JOIN msdb.dbo.syspolicy_policy_execution_history AS b
    ON a.policy_id = b.policy_id;
```

The following behavior applies if you specify NULL for one or both values:

- To delete all policy execution history, specify NULL for both *@policy_id* and for *@oldest_date*.

- To delete all policy execution history for a specific policy, specify a policy identifier for *@policy_id*, and specify NULL as *@oldest_date*.

- To delete policy execution history for all policies before a specific date, specify NULL for *@policy_id*, and specify a date for *@oldest_date*.

To archive policy execution history, you can open the Policy History log, in Object Explorer, and export the execution history to a file. To access the Policy History log, expand **Management**, right-click **Policy Management**, and then select **View History**.

## Permissions

Requires membership in the **PolicyAdministratorRole** fixed database role.

[!INCLUDE [policy-administrator-role](includes/policy-administrator-role.md)]

## Examples

The following example deletes policy execution history before a specific date for a policy with an ID of `7`.

```sql
EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_syspolicy_delete_policy_execution_history
    @policy_id = 7,
    @oldest_date = '2019-02-16 16:00:00.000';
GO
```
