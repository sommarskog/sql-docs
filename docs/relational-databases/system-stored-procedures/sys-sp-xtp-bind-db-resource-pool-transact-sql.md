# sys.sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Binds the specified [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] database to the specified resource pool. Both the database and the resource pool must exist prior to executing `sys.sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool`.

This system procedure creates a binding between the Resource Governor pool identified by *@resource_pool_name*, and the database identified by *@database_name*. It isn't required that the database has any memory-optimized objects at the time of binding. In the absence of memory-optimized objects, there's no memory taken from the resource pool. This binding will be used by Resource Governor to manage memory allocated by [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] allocators.

If there's already a binding in place for a given database, the procedure returns an error. In no event may a database have more than one active binding.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sys.sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool
    [ @database_name = ] 'database_name'
    , [ @resource_pool_name = ] 'resource_pool_name'
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @database_name = ] '*database_name*'

The name of an existing [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] enabled database. *@database_name* is **sysname**.

#### [ @resource_pool_name = ] '*resource_pool_name*'

The name of an existing resource pool. *@resource_pool_name* is **sysname**.

## Messages

When an error occurs `sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool` returns one of these messages.

#### Database doesn't exist

*@database_name* must refer to an existing database. If there's no database with the specified ID, the following message is returned:

> Database ID %d does not exist. Please use a valid database ID for this binding.

```output
Msg 911, Level 16, State 18, Procedure sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool_internal, Line 51
Database 'Hekaton_DB213' does not exist. Make sure that the name is entered correctly.
```

#### Database is a system database

[!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] tables can't be created in system databases. Thus it is invalid to create a binding of [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] memory for such a database. The following error is returned:

> Database_name %s refers to a system database. Resource pools may only be bound to a user database.

```output
Msg 41371, Level 16, State 1, Procedure sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool_internal, Line 51
Binding to a resource pool is not supported for system database 'master'. This operation can only be performed on a user database.
```

#### Resource pool doesn't exist

The resource pool identified by *@resource_pool_name* must exist prior to executing `sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool`. If there's no pool with the specified ID, the following error is returned:

> Resource Pool %s does not exist. Please enter a valid resource pool name.

```output
Msg 41370, Level 16, State 1, Procedure sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool_internal, Line 51
Resource pool 'Pool_Hekaton' does not exist or resource governor has not been reconfigured.
```

#### Pool_name refers to a reserved system pool

The pool names "INTERNAL" and "DEFAULT" are reserved for system pools. It isn't valid to explicitly bind a database to either of these. If a system pool name is entered, the following error is returned:

> Resource Pool %s is a system resource pool. System resource pools may not be explicitly bound to a database using this procedure.

```output
Msg 41373, Level 16, State 1, Procedure sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool_internal, Line 51
Database 'Hekaton_DB' cannot be explicitly bound to the resource pool 'internal'. A database can only be bound only to a user resource pool.
```

#### Database is already bound to another resource pool

A database can be bound to only one resource pool at any time. Database bindings to resource pools must be explicitly removed before they can be bound to another pool. See [sys.sp_xtp_unbind_db_resource_pool (Transact-SQL)](sys-sp-xtp-unbind-db-resource-pool-transact-sql.md).

> Database %s is already bound to resource pool %s. You must unbind before you can create a new binding.

```output
Msg 41372, Level 16, State 1, Procedure sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool_internal, Line 54
Database 'Hekaton_DB' is currently bound to a resource pool. A database must be unbound before creating a new binding.
```

When successful, `sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool` returns the following message.

#### Successful binding

When successful, the function returns the following success message, which is logged in the SQL Server error log.

> A resource binding has been successfully created between the database with ID %d and the resource pool with ID %d.

## Examples

A. The following code example binds the database `Hekaton_DB` to the resource pool `Pool_Hekaton`.

```sql
sys.sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool N'Hekaton_DB', N'Pool_Hekaton';
```

The binding takes effect the next time the database is brought online.

B. This expanded version of the previous example includes some extra checks. Execute the following [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]:

```sql
DECLARE @resourcePool SYSNAME = N'Pool_Hekaton';
DECLARE @database SYSNAME = N'Hekaton_DB';

-- Check whether resource pool exists
IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT *
        FROM sys.resource_governor_resource_pools
        WHERE name = @resourcePool
        )
BEGIN
    SELECT N'Resource pool "' + @resourcePool + N'" does not exist or resource governor has not been reconfigured.';
END
-- Check whether database is already bound to a resource pool
ELSE IF EXISTS (
        SELECT p.name
        FROM sys.databases d
        INNER JOIN sys.resource_governor_resource_pools p
            ON d.resource_pool_id = p.pool_id
        WHERE d.name = @database
        )
BEGIN
    SELECT N'Database "' + @database + N'" is currently bound to resource pool "' + @resourcePool + N'". A database must be unbound before creating a new binding.';
END
-- Bind resource pool to database.
ELSE
BEGIN
    EXEC sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool @database,
        @resourcePool;
END
```

## Requirements

Both the database specified by *@database_name* and the resource pool specified by *@resource_pool_name* must exist prior to binding them.

Requires CONTROL SERVER permission.
