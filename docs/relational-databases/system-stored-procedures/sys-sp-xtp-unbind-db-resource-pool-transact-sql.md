# sys.sp_xtp_unbind_db_resource_pool (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This system procedure removes an existing binding between a database and a resource pool for purposes of tracking [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] memory usage. If there is no pool currently bound to the specified database, success is returned. When the database is unbound, the previously allocated memory for memory-optimized objects stays allocated to the previous resource pool. You need to restart the database to free up the allocated memory. Once a database is unbound from the resource pool, the binding resorts to the DEFAULT resource pool.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sys.sp_xtp_unbind_db_resource_pool
    [ @database_name = ] 'database_name'
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @database_name = ] '*database_name*'

The name of an existing [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] enabled database. *@database_name* is **sysname**.

## Messages

If a database was bound to a named resource pool, the procedure returns successfully. However, you must restart the database for unbinding to take effect.

If there is no existing binding for the database specified, `sp_xtp_unbind_db_resource_pool` returns success, but gives the informational message:

```output
Msg 41374, Level 16, State 1, Procedure sp_xtp_unbind_db_resource_pool_internal, Line 140.
Database 'Hekaton_DB' does not have a binding to a resource pool.
```

## Example

The following code unbinds the database `Hekaton_DB` from the [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] resource pool it is bound to. If `Hekaton_DB` isn't currently bound to a [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] resource pool, a message is given. The database must be restarted for the unbinding to take effect.

```sql
sys.sp_xtp_unbind_db_resource_pool N'Hekaton_DB';
```

## Requirements

- The database specified by *@database_name* must have a binding to an [!INCLUDE [inmemory](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] resource pool.

- Requires CONTROL SERVER permission.
