## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_fulltext_pendingchanges table_id
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### *table_id*

ID of the table. If the table isn't full-text indexed, or change tracking isn't enabled on the table, an error is returned.

## Result sets

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Key** | <sup>1</sup> | The full-text key value from the specified table. |
| **DocId** | **bigint** | An internal document identifier (DocId) column that corresponds to the key value. |
| **Status** | **int** | 0 = Row will be removed from the full-text index.<br /><br />1 = Row will be full-text indexed.<br /><br />2 = Row is up-to-date.<br /><br />-1 = Row is in a transitional (batched, but not committed) state or an error state. |
| **DocState** | **tinyint** | A raw dump of the internal document identifier (DocId) map status column. |

<sup>1</sup> The data type for Key is same as the data type of the full-text key column in the base table.

## Permissions

Requires membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role, or execute permission directly on this stored procedure.

## Remarks

If there are no changes to process, an empty rowset is returned.

Full-Text Search queries don't return rows with a `Status` value of `0`. This is because the row has been deleted from base table and is waiting to be deleted from the full-text index.

To find out how many changes are pending for a particular table, use the `TableFullTextPendingChanges` property of the `OBJECTPROPERTYEX` function.
