## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_syscollector_upload_collection_set
    [ [ @collection_set_id = ] collection_set_id ]
    [ , [ @name = ] N'name' ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @collection_set_id = ] *collection_set_id*

The unique local identifier for the collection set. *@collection_set_id* is **int**, and must have a value if *@name* is `NULL`.

#### [ @name = ] N'*name*'

The name of the collection set. *@name* is **sysname**, and must have a value if *@collection_set_id* is `NULL`.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Remarks

Either *@collection_set_id* or *@name* must have a value; both can't be `NULL`.

This procedure can be used for starting an on-demand upload for a running collection set. It can only be used for collection sets that are configured for cached mode data collection and upload. This enables a user to obtain data to analyze without having to wait for a scheduled upload.

## Permissions

Requires membership in the **dc_operator** (with EXECUTE permission) fixed database role to execute this procedure.

## Example

Does an on-demand upload of a collection set named `Simple Collection Set`.

```sql
USE msdb;
GO
EXEC sp_syscollector_upload_collection_set @name = 'Simple Collection Set';
```
