# sp_cursorclose (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_cursorclose cursor  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *cursor*  
 Is a cursor *handle* value generated by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and returned by the sp_cursoropen procedure. *cursor* is a required parameter that calls for an **int** input value.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  An input value of -1 will apply towards all cursors on the current connection.  
  
## Remarks  
 *cursor* will return error messages if the procedure was run after the cursor had been closed or if an invalid handle is specified.  
  
 RPC status indicates overall success or failure.  
  
 DONE rowcount is always 0.
