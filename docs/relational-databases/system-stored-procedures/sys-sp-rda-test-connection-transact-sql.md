# sys.sp_rda_test_connection (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2016](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016.md)]

Tests the connection from SQL Server to the remote Azure server and reports problems that may prevent data migration.

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
EXECUTE sys.sp_rda_test_connection
    @database_name = N'db_name'
    , @server_address = N'azure_server_fully_qualified_address'
    , @azure_username = N'azure_username'
    , @azure_password = N'azure_password'
    , @credential_name = N'credential_name'
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### @database_name = N'*db_name*'

The name of the Stretch-enabled SQL Server database. This parameter is optional.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Stretch Database is deprecated in [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE [ssNoteDepFutureAvoid-md](../../includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)]

#### @server_address = N'*azure_server_fully_qualified_address*'

The fully qualified address of the Azure server.

- If you provide a value for *@database_name*, but the specified database isn't Stretch-enabled, then you have to provide a value for *@server_address*.

- If you provide a value for *@database_name*, and the specified database is Stretch-enabled, then you don't have to provide a value for *@server_address*. If you provide a value for *@server_address*, the stored procedure ignores it and uses existing Azure server already associated with the Stretch-enabled database.

#### @azure_username = N'*azure_username*'

The user name for the remote Azure server.

#### @azure_password = N'*azure_password*'

The password for the remote Azure server.

#### @credential_name = N'*credential_name*'

Instead of providing a user name and password, you can provide the name of a credential stored in the Stretch-enabled database.

## Return code values

In case of success, `sp_rda_test_connection` returns error 14855 (`STRETCH_MAJOR, STRETCH_CONNECTION_TEST_PROC_SUCCEEDED`) with severity `EX_INFO` and a success return code.

In case of failure, `sp_rda_test_connection` returns error 14856 (`STRETCH_MAJOR, STRETCH_CONNECTION_TEST_PROC_FAILED`) with severity `EX_USER` and an error return code.

## Result sets

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `link_state` | **int** | One of the following values, which correspond to the values for `link_state_desc`.<br /><br />- 0<br />- 1<br />- 2<br />- 3<br />- 4 |
| `link_state_desc` | **varchar(32)** | One of the following values, which correspond to the preceding values for `link_state`.<br /><br />- HEALTHY<br />The between SQL Server and the remote Azure server is healthy.<br />- ERROR_AZURE_FIREWALL<br />The Azure firewall is preventing the link between SQL Server and the remote Azure server.<br />- ERROR_NO_CONNECTION<br />SQL Server can't make a connection to the remote Azure server.<br />- ERROR_AUTH_FAILURE<br />An authentication failure is preventing the link between SQL Server and the remote Azure server.<br />- ERROR<br />An error that's not an authentication issue, a connectivity issue, or a firewall issue is preventing the link between SQL Server and the remote Azure server. |
| `error_number` | **int** | The number of the error. If there's no error, this field is NULL. |
| `error_message` | **nvarchar(1024)** | The error message. If there's no error, this field is NULL. |

## Permissions

Requires **db_owner** permissions.

## Examples

### Check the connection from SQL Server to the remote Azure server

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_rda_test_connection @database_name = N'<Stretch-enabled database>';
GO
```

The results show that SQL Server can't connect to the remote Azure server.

| link_state | link_state_desc | error_number | error_message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | ERROR_NO_CONNECTION | *\<connection-related error number>* | *\<connection-related error message>* |

### Check the Azure firewall

```sql
USE <Stretch-enabled database>
GO
EXECUTE sys.sp_rda_test_connection;
GO
```

The results show that the Azure firewall is preventing the link  between SQL Server and the remote Azure server.

| link_state | link_state_desc | error_number | error_message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ERROR_AZURE_FIREWALL | *\<firewall-related error number>* | *\<firewall-related error message>* |

### Check authentication credentials

```sql
USE <Stretch-enabled database>
GO
EXECUTE sys.sp_rda_test_connection;
GO
```

The results show that an authentication failure is preventing the link  between SQL Server and the remote Azure server.

| link_state | link_state_desc | error_number | error_message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | ERROR_AUTH_FAILURE | *\<authentication-related error number>* | *\<authentication-related error message>* |

### Check the status of the remote Azure server

```sql
USE <SQL Server database>
GO
EXECUTE sys.sp_rda_test_connection
    @server_address = N'<server name>.database.windows.net',
    @azure_username = N'<user name>',
    @azure_password = N'<password>';
GO
```

The results show that the connection is healthy and that you can enable Stretch Database for the specified database.

| link_state | link_state_desc | error_number | error_message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | HEALTHY | NULL | NULL |
