# sp_add_log_shipping_alert_job (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This stored procedure checks to see if an alert job has been created on this server. If an alert job doesn't exist, `sp_add_log_shipping_alert_job` creates the alert job, and adds its job ID to the `log_shipping_monitor_alert` table. The alert job is enabled by default, and runs on a schedule of once every two minutes.
