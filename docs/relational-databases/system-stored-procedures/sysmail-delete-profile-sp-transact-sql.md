:::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/topic-link-icon.svg" border="false"::: [Transact-SQL syntax conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sysmail_delete_profile_sp { [ @profile_id = ] profile_id | [ @profile_name = ] 'profile_name' }
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @profile_id = ] *profile_id*

The profile ID of the profile to be deleted. *@profile_id* is **int**, with a default of NULL. Either *@profile_id* or *@profile_name* must be specified.

#### [ @profile_name = ] '*profile_name*'

The name of the profile to be deleted. *@profile_name* is **sysname**, with a default of NULL. Either *@profile_id* or *@profile_name* must be specified.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Result sets

None.

## Remarks

Deleting a profile doesn't delete the accounts used by the profile.

This stored procedure deletes the profile regardless of whether users have access to the profile. Use caution when removing the default private profile for a user or the default public profile for the `msdb` database. When no default profile is available, `sp_send_dbmail` requires the name of a profile as an argument. Therefore, removing a default profile may cause calls to `sp_send_dbmail` to fail. For more information, see [sp_send_dbmail (Transact-SQL)](sp-send-dbmail-transact-sql.md).

The stored procedure `sysmail_delete_profile_sp` is in the `msdb` database and is owned by the **dbo** schema. The procedure must be executed with a three-part name if the current database isn't `msdb`.

## Permissions

[!INCLUDE [msdb-execute-permissions](../../includes/msdb-execute-permissions.md)]

## Examples

The following example shows deleting the profile named `AdventureWorks Administrator`.

```sql
EXEC msdb.dbo.sysmail_delete_profile_sp
    @profile_name = 'AdventureWorks Administrator';
```
