# sys.sp_persistent_version_cleanup (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2019, ASDB, ASDBMI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Manually starts persistent version store (PVS) cleanup process, a key element of accelerated database recovery (ADR). This cleaner rolls back uncommitted data in the PVS from aborted transactions.

It isn't typically necessary to start the PVS cleanup process manually using `sys.sp_persistent_version_cleanup`. However in some scenarios, in a known period of rest/recovery after busy OLTP activity, you may want to initiate the PVS cleanup process manually.

For more information on ADR on Azure SQL, see [Accelerated Database Recovery in Azure SQL](/azure/azure-sql/accelerated-database-recovery).

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sp_persistent_version_cleanup
    [ [ @dbname = ] N'dbname' ]
    [ , [ @scanallpages = ] scanallpages ]
    [ , [ @clean_option = ] clean_option ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @dbname = ] N'*dbname*'

Optional. The name of the database to clean up. If not provided, uses the current database context. *@dbname* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`.

#### [ @scanallpages = ] *scanallpages*

Optional. *@scanallpages* is **bit**, with a default of `0`. When set to `1`, this option forces cleanup of all database pages even if not versioned.

#### [ @clean_option = ] *clean_option*

Optional. Possible options determine whether or not to reclaim off-row PVS page. *@clean_option* is **int**, with a default of `0`. This reference isn't commonly needed and the default value `0` is recommended.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Default, no option specified |
| 1 | off-row version store without checking individual PVS page contents |
| 2 | off-row version store with each PVS page visited |
| 3 | in-row version store only |
| 4 | internal use only |

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Result sets

None.

## Permissions

Requires the ALTER DATABASE permission to execute.

## Remarks

The `sys.sp_persistent_version_cleanup` stored procedure is synchronous, meaning that it doesn't complete until all version information is cleaned up from the current PVS.

In [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)], the PVS cleanup process only executes for one database at a time. In Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance, and beginning with [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)], the PVS cleanup process can execute in parallel against multiple databases in the same instance.

If the PVS cleanup process is already running against the desired database, this stored procedure is blocked and wait for completion before starting another PVS cleanup process. Active, long-running transactions in any database where ADR is enabled can also block cleanup of the PVS. You can monitor the version cleaner task by looking for its process with the following sample query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests
WHERE command LIKE '%PERSISTED_VERSION_CLEANER%';
```

### Limitations

Database Mirroring can't be set for a database where ADR is enabled or there are still versions in the persisted version store (PVS). If ADR is disabled, run `sys.sp_persistent_version_cleanup` to clean up previous versions still in the PVS.

## Example

To activate the PVS cleanup process manually between workloads or during maintenance windows, use the following sample script:

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_persistent_version_cleanup [database_name];
```

For example:

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_persistent_version_cleanup [WideWorldImporters];
```

Or, to assume the current database context:

```sql
USE [WideWorldImporters];
GO
EXEC sys.sp_persistent_version_cleanup;
```
