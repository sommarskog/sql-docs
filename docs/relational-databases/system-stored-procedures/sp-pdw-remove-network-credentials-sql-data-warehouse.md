# sp_pdw_remove_network_credentials (Azure Synapse Analytics)
[!INCLUDE[applies-to-version/asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/asa-pdw.md)]

  This removes network credentials stored in [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] to access a network file share. For example, use this stored procedure to remove permission for [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] to perform backup and restore operations on a server that resides within your own network.

## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql  
-- Syntax for Azure Synapse Analytics and Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
sp_pdw_remove_network_credentials 'target_server_name'  
```

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax](../../includes/synapse-analytics-od-unsupported-syntax.md)]

## Arguments  
 '*target_server_name*'  
 Specifies the target server host name or IP address. Credentials to access this server will be removed from [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)]. This does not change or remove any permissions on the actual target server which is managed by your own team.  
  
 *target_server_name* is defined as nvarchar(337).  
  
## Return Code Values  
 0 (success) or 1 (failure)  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires **ALTER SERVER STATE** permission.  
  
## Error Handling  
 An error occurs if removing credentials does not succeed on the Control node and all Compute nodes.  
  
## General Remarks  
 This stored procedure removes network credentials from the NetworkService account for [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)]. The NetworkService account runs each instance of SMP [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on the Control node and the Compute nodes. For example, when a backup operation runs, the Control node and each Compute node will use the NetworkService account credentials to access the target server.  
  
## Metadata  
 To list all credentials and to verify the credentials have been removed, use [sys.dm_pdw_network_credentials &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-pdw-network-credentials-transact-sql.md).  
  
 To add credentials, use [sp_pdw_add_network_credentials &#40;Azure Synapse Analytics&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-pdw-add-network-credentials-sql-data-warehouse.md).  
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssazuresynapse-md](../../includes/ssazuresynapse-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
  
### A. Remove credentials for performing a database backup  
 The following example removes user name and password credentials for accessing the target server which has an IP address of 10.192.147.63.  
  
```sql  
EXEC sp_pdw_remove_network_credentials '10.192.147.63';  
```
