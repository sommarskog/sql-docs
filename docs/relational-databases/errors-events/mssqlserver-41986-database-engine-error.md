|Message Text|Azure SQL Managed Instance link creation failed because either connection to SQL Server failed, or the server did not respond after a prolonged period of time. Verify the network connectivity and firewall rules between SQL Server and Managed Instance are properly configured and retry again.|  
  
## Explanation  

The link failed to create because either the connection to the secondary replica failed, or the server didn't respond after a prolonged period of time. This could be due to network connectivity issues or incorrectly configured firewall rules.
  
## User Action  

Verify that network connectivity was successfully established between SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance, and that firewall rules are correctly configured, as described in [Configure network connectivity](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/managed-instance-link-preparation#configure-network-connectivity). Retry the operation after connection has been verified successfully.
