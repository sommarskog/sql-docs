> [!NOTE]
> **This article is focused on SQL Server.** For information on troubleshooting out of memory issues in Azure SQL Database, see [Troubleshoot out of memory errors with Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/troubleshoot-memory-errors-issues).
  
## Explanation  
This is caused when the buffer pool is full and the buffer pool cannot grow any larger.  
  
## User action  
The following list outlines general steps that will help in troubleshooting memory errors:  
  
1.  Verify whether other applications or services are consuming memory on this server. Reconfigure less critical applications or services to consume less memory.  
  
2.  Start collecting performance monitor counters for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]**: Buffer Manager**, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]**: Memory Manager**.  
  
3.  Check the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] memory configuration parameters:  
  
    -   **max server memory**  
  
    -   **min server memory**  
  
    -   **min memory per query**  
  
    Notice any unusual settings and correct them as necessary. Account for increased memory requirements for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Default settings are listed in [Server memory configuration options](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-memory-server-configuration-options.md).
  
4.  Observe DBCC MEMORYSTATUS output and the way it changes when you see these error messages.  
  
5.  Check the workload (number of concurrent sessions, currently executing queries).  
  
The following actions may make more memory available to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
-   If applications besides [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are consuming resources, try stopping these applications or running them on a separate server.  
  
-   If you have configured **max server memory**, increase its setting. For more information, see [Set options manually](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-memory-server-configuration-options.md#manually).
  
Run the following DBCC commands to free several [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] memory caches.  
  
-   DBCC FREESYSTEMCACHE  
  
-   DBCC FREESESSIONCACHE  
  
-   DBCC FREEPROCCACHE  
  
If the problem continues, you will need to investigate further and possibly reduce workload.
