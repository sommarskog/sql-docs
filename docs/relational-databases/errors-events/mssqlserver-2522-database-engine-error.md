# MSSQLSERVER_2522
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  
## Details  
  
| Attribute | Value |  
| :-------- | :---- |  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|2522|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|DBCC_INDEX_FILEGROUP_IS_INVALID|  
|Message Text|Unable to process index I_NAME of table O_NAME because filegroup F_NAME is invalid.|  
  
## Explanation  
This informational message indicates that the index cannot be checked because one of the filegroup IDs that is stored in the metadata of the index does not exist. The filegroup ID that is not valid might pertain to the data itself, or to the large object (LOB) data, or to the row-overflow data.  
  
If there are no problems, all other indexes of the same object will be checked.  
  
## User Action  
  
### Look for Hardware Failure  
Run hardware diagnostics and correct any problems. Also examine the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows system and application logs and the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error log to see whether the error occurred as the result of hardware failure. Fix any hardware-related problems that are contained in the logs.  
  
If you have persistent data corruption problems, try to swap out different hardware components to isolate the problem. Check to make sure that the system does not have write-caching enabled on the disk controller. If you suspect write-caching to be the problem, contact your hardware vendor.  
  
Finally, you might find it useful to switch to a new hardware system. This switch may include reformatting the disk drives and reinstalling the operating system.  
  
### Restore from Backup  
If the problem is not hardware related and a known clean backup is available, restore the database from the backup.  
  
### Run DBCC CHECKDB  
Not applicable. This error cannot be repaired automatically.
