# MSSQLSERVER_948
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  
## Details  
  
| Attribute | Value |  
| :-------- | :---- |  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|948|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|NA|  
|Message Text|The database '%.*ls' cannot be opened because it is version %d. This server supports version %d and earlier. A downgrade path is not supported.|  
  
## Explanation  
Certain features in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] affect the structure of the database files. When you attach a database to another instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the file format might not be compatible with a different version of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
For example, this error can be caused by using the vardecimal storage format in a later version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and then trying to attach the database files in a version earlier than [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] Service Pack 2.  
  
## User Action  
Determine the version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that is running on the originating server. In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], either right-click the server and then click **Properties** or type **SELECT @@VERSION** in a query window. Open the database by using the original version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Investigate the features that are enabled on the original database in the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Modify these settings to work with the version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in which the database will be attached.
