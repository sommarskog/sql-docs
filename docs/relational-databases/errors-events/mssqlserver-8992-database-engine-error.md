# MSSQLSERVER_8992
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  
## Details  
  
|Item|Value|
|:---|:---|
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|8992|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|DBCC3_CHECK_CATALOG|  
|Message Text|Check Catalog Msg ERROR Level LEVEL State STATE: MESSAGE.|  

> [!NOTE]
> 8992 Error message references another specific message (ranging from 3851 to 3858) about the actual inconsistency.

## Explanation  
DBCC CHECKCATALOG or DBCC CHECKDB found an inconsistency in the system metadata tables for the specified object. That is, there is an inconsistency between the recorded object ID and the object specified in error message.  
  
This error can occur when one or more system tables has been manually updated in a way that creates an inconsistency in the system metadata. For example, a user may have manually deleted an object from the **sysobjects** table without removing associated rows in other tables such as **sysindexes** and **syscolumns**.  
  
This error can occur when running DBCC CHECKDB against a database that has been upgraded from SQL Server 2000 to SQL Server 2005 or later. In SQL Server 2000, DBCC CHECKDB did not include DBCC CHECKCATALOG functionality, so the error would not be caught before upgrade unless DBCC CHECKCATALOG was specifically executed against the database in SQL Server 2000.  
  
You may see any of the following errors in conjunction with error 8992:  

|Msg ID|Msg text|
|:---|:---|
|3851|An invalid row (%ls) was found in the system table sys.%ls%ls.|
|3852|Row (%ls) in sys.%ls%ls does not have a matching row (%ls) in sys.%ls%ls.|
|3853|Attribute (%ls) of row (%ls) in sys.%ls%ls does not have a matching row (%ls) in sys.%ls%ls.|
|3854|Attribute (%ls) of row (%ls) in sys.%ls%ls has a matching row (%ls) in sys.%ls%ls that is invalid.|
|3855|Attribute (%ls) exists without a row (%ls) in sys.%ls%ls.|
|3856|Attribute (%ls) exists but should not for row (%ls) in sys.%ls%ls.|
|3857|The attribute (%ls) is required but is missing for row (%ls) in sys.%ls%ls.|
|3858|The attribute (%ls) of row (%ls) in sys.%ls%ls has an invalid value.|

## User Action  
  
### Drop and Re-create the Specified Object  
If possible, drop and recreate the specified object. For example, if the object is a stored procedure or user-defined type, recreating the object may resolve the problem.  
  
### Restore from Backup  
If the problem is not hardware related and a known clean backup is available, restore the database from the backup. This action is only applicable if the backup does not contain the metadata error.  
  
### Export the Data to a New Database  
If the backup also contains the metadata inconsistency, you need to create a new database and export the contents of the existing database to the new database.  
  
### DBCC CHECKDB Cannot Repair This Error  
This error cannot be repaired.  If you cannot restore the database from a backup, contact [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Customer Service and Support (CSS).  
  
### Do Not Manually Update System Tables  

Do not make manual updates to system tables. SQL Server does not support any manual changes to system databases. If you update a system table in a SQL Server database, the following events are logged:

#### When a system table is manually updated

Msg 17659: Warning: System table ID \<id\> has been updated directly in database ID \<id\> and cache coherence may not have been maintained. SQL Server should be restarted.

#### Starting a database with a system table that was manually updated

Msg 3859: Warning: The system catalog was updated directly in database ID \<id\>, most recently at date_time

#### when you execute the DBCC_CHECKDB command after a system table is manually updated

Msg 3859: Warning: The system catalog was updated directly in database ID \<id\>, most recently at date_time.
