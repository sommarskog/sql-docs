| 27301 | 16 | Yes | Operation is not supported unless all bricks are online. Bring the offline bricks back online, and retry the operation. |
| 27302 | 16 | Yes | An internal communication error occurred. Retry the operation. |
| 27303 | 16 | Yes | An unexpected error with HRESULT 0x%x occurred while processing backup files. Refer to the SQL Server error log for information about any related errors that were encountered. Address those errors if necessary, and retry the operation. |
| 27304 | 16 | Yes | The number of matching backup files (%d) is less than the required number (%d). Copy all the right backup files to the proper backup location, and retry the restore operation. |
| 27305 | 16 | Yes | The number of backup files (%d) is greater than the available number of bricks (%d). You must restore backup files on to at least as many bricks as present in the original MatrixDB where the backup was created. Configure a new MatrixDB with enough bricks to match the number of bricks in the original MatrixDB, and retry the operation. |
| 27306 | 16 | Yes | No matching backup files were found by any of the bricks. Copy the backup files to the correct backup location, and retry the operation. If the backup files belong to a different family, drop the database and then retry the operation. |
| 27307 | 16 | Yes | Brick ID %d has no backup files available. Copy the backup file for the segment to this brick, and retry the operation. |
| 27308 | 16 | Yes | SegmentID %d from the archive does not match the segmentID %d from the specified filename on brick %d. |
| 27309 | 16 | Yes | Restore recovery failed because a problem was detected with data in a temporary file that is needed for recovery. This error can be caused because of a storage device failure or because the restore checkpoint restart file has been moved or deleted. Retry the last restore operation. If the operation fails again, retry the entire restore sequence. |
| 27310 | 16 | Yes | Restore failed because all the backup files did not come from the same backup operation. Retry the restore operation using the backup files from a single backup operation. |
| 27311 | 16 | Yes | Restore failed because of an internal communications error. Retry the restore operation after addressing any network issues. |
| 27312 | 16 | Yes | Device name '%ls' is not valid in a Matrix Backup/Restore command. The device name contains illegal characters or file name is empty. Retry the command using a valid device name. |
| 27313 | 16 | Yes | Restore command is not valid as both Standalone and Matrix archives were found while disambiguating the device name(s). Retry the command after making sure that there is only a Standalone archive or matching Matrix archives. |
| 27314 | 16 | Yes | Restore failed because the brick count of %ld is different from the BACKUP GROUP COUNT %ld from the backup file. Make sure that all Matrix backup files are from the same backup operation, or re-configure the brick count of the MatrixDB to match the group count of the MatrixDB where the backup files were created. |
| 27315 | 16 | Yes | An unexpected error occurred while executing a Backup/Restore command. Refer to the SQL Server error log for information about any related errors that were encountered. Address those errors if necessary, and retry the operation. |
| 27316 | 16 | Yes | Device name '%.\*ls' is not a valid MOVE target of a Matrix Restore command. Retry the command using a valid relative path name. |
| 27317 | 16 | Yes | The backup files of the RESTORE command do not match with the segments of the existing database. Copy the backup files to the correct backup location, using family GUID if necessary, and retry the restore operation. |
| 27318 | 16 | Yes | The backup files of the FULL RESTORE command do not match with the segments of the existing database. Copy the correct backup files to the backup location, using family GUID if necessary, and retry the restore operation or use WITH REPLACE option to overwrite the existing database. |
| 27319 | 16 | Yes | The backup type of all the archive segments is not the same. Copy the correct backup files to the backup location, and retry the restore operation. |
