| 8605 | 10 | No | Index creation operation will use %ld KB of memory specified in the advanced sp_configure option "min memory per query (KB)" instead of %lu KB specified in "index create memory (KB)" option because the former has to be smaller than the latter. |
| 8606 | 17 | No | This index operation requires %I64d KB of memory per DOP. The total requirement of %I64d KB for DOP of %lu is greater than the sp_configure value of %lu KB set for the advanced server configuration option "index create memory (KB)". Increase this setting or reduce DOP and rerun the query. |
| 8607 | 16 | No | The table '%.\*ls' cannot be modified because one or more non-clustered indexes reside in a filegroup which is not online. |
| 8608 | 16 | No | The query could not be completed due to an online index build operation and must be recompiled. |
| 8616 | 10 | No | The index hints for table '%.\*ls' were ignored because the table was considered a fact table in the star join. |
| 8618 | 16 | No | The query processor could not produce a query plan because a worktable is required, and its minimum row size exceeds the maximum allowable of %d bytes. A typical reason why a worktable is required is a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause in the query. If the query has a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause, consider reducing the number and/or size of the fields in the clause. Consider using prefix (LEFT()) or hash (CHECKSUM()) of fields for grouping or prefix for ordering. Note however that this will change the behavior of the query. |
| 8619 | 16 | No | The query processor could not produce a query plan because a worktable is required, and its minimum row size exceeds the maximum allowable of %d bytes. A typical reason why a worktable is required is a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause in the query. Resubmit your query without the ROBUST PLAN hint. |
| [8621](../mssqlserver-8621-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | The query processor ran out of stack space during query optimization. Please simplify the query. |
| 8622 | 16 | No | Query processor could not produce a query plan because of the hints defined in this query. Resubmit the query without specifying any hints and without using SET FORCEPLAN. |
| [8623](../mssqlserver-8623-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | Yes | The query processor ran out of internal resources and could not produce a query plan. This is a rare event and only expected for extremely complex queries or queries that reference a very large number of tables or partitions. Please simplify the query. If you believe you have received this message in error, contact Customer Support Services for more information. |
| 8624 | 16 | Yes | Internal Query Processor Error: The query processor could not produce a query plan. For more information, contact Customer Support Services. |
| 8625 | 10 | No | Warning: The join order has been enforced because a local join hint is used. |
| 8628 | 17 | Yes | A time out occurred while waiting to optimize the query. Rerun the query. |
| [8630](../mssqlserver-8630-database-engine-error.md) | 17 | No | Internal Query Processor Error: The query processor encountered an unexpected error during execution (HRESULT = 0x%x). |
| 8631 | 17 | No | Internal error: Server stack limit has been reached. Please look for potentially deep nesting in your query, and try to simplify it. |
| [8632](../mssqlserver-8632-database-engine-error.md) | 17 | No | Internal error: An expression services limit has been reached. Please look for potentially complex expressions in your query, and try to simplify them. |
| 8633 | 16 | No | The query processor could not produce a query plan because distributed query does not support materializing intermediate results with default in DML queries over remote sources. Try to use actual default values instead of default or split the update into multiple statements, one only containing the DEFAULT assignment, the other with the rest. |
| 8634 | 17 | No | The query processor received an error from a cluster communication layer. |
| 8635 | 16 | No | The query processor could not produce a query plan for a query with a spatial index hint. Reason: %S_MSG. Try removing the index hints or removing SET FORCEPLAN. |
| 8636 | 16 | No | The query processor could not produce a query plan because there is a subquery in the predicate of the full outer join. This is not supported for distributed queries. |
| 8637 | 16 | No | The query processor could not produce a query plan because a USE PLAN hint was used for a query that modifies data while the target table of the modification has an index that is currently being built online. Consider waiting until the online index build is done before forcing the plan, or using another way to tune the query, such as updating statistics, or using a different hint or a manual query rewrite. |
| 8638 | 16 | No | The query processor could not produce a query plan because CURSOR fetch queries cannot reference external tables. Ensure that the input request does not contain remote UPDATE or DELETE on external tables. |
| [8642](../mssqlserver-8642-database-engine-error.md) | 17 | No | The query processor could not start the necessary thread resources for parallel query execution. Reduce load on the server or use the MAXDOP setting to limit parallelism. |
| 8644 | 16 | No | Internal Query Processor Error: The plan selected for execution does not support the invoked given execution routine. |
| [8645](../mssqlserver-8645-database-engine-error.md) | 17 | Yes | A timeout occurred while waiting for memory resources to execute the query in resource pool '%ls' (%ld). Rerun the query. |
| 8646 | 21 | Yes | Unable to find index entry in index ID %d, of table %d, in database '%.\*ls'. The indicated index is corrupt or there is a problem with the current update plan. Run DBCC CHECKDB or DBCC CHECKTABLE. If the problem persists, contact product support. |
| 8648 | 20 | Yes | Could not insert a row larger than the page size into a hash table. Resubmit the query using the ROBUST PLAN optimization hint. |
| [8649](../mssqlserver-8649-database-engine-error.md) | 17 | No | The query has been canceled because the estimated cost of this query (%d) exceeds the configured threshold of %d. Contact the system administrator. |
| [8651](../mssqlserver-8651-database-engine-error.md) | 17 | No | Could not perform the operation because the requested memory grant was not available in resource pool '%ls' (%ld). Rerun the query, reduce the query load, or check resource governor configuration setting. |
| 8653 | 16 | No | The query processor is unable to produce a plan for the table or view '%.\*ls' because the table resides in a filegroup that is not online. |
| 8655 | 16 | No | The query processor is unable to produce a plan because the index '%.\*ls' on table or view '%.\*ls' is disabled. |
| 8656 | 16 | No | The query processor could not produce a query plan. Resubmit the query after disabling trace flag %d. |
| 8657 | 17 | No | Could not get the memory grant of %I64d KB because it exceeds the maximum configuration limit in workload group '%ls' (%ld) and resource pool '%ls' (%ld). Contact the server administrator to increase the memory usage limit. |
| 8658 | 17 | No | Cannot start the columnstore index build because it requires at least %I64d KB, while the maximum memory grant is limited to %I64d KB per query in workload group '%ls' (%ld) and resource pool '%ls' (%ld). Retry after modifying columnstore index to contain fewer columns, or after increasing the maximum memory grant limit with Resource Governor. |
| 8659 | 17 | No | Cannot continue columnstore index build because it requires %I64d KB misc memory per thread, while the total memory grant for query is %I64d KB, total Columnstore bulk insert memory is limited to %I64d KB in query, and the maximum memory grant is limited to %I64d KB per query in workload group id=%ld and resource pool id=%ld. Retry after modifying columnstore index to contain fewer columns, or after increasing the maximum memory grant limit with Resource Governor. |
| 8660 | 16 | No | Cannot create the clustered index "%.\*ls" on view "%.\*ls" because the select list of the view definition does not include all columns in the GROUP BY clause. Consider adding these columns to the select list. |
| 8661 | 16 | No | Cannot create the clustered index "%.\*ls" on view "%.\*ls" because the index key includes columns that are not in the GROUP BY clause. Consider eliminating columns that are not in the GROUP BY clause from the index key. |
| 8662 | 16 | No | Cannot create the clustered index "%.\*ls" on view "%.\*ls" because the view references an unknown value (SUM aggregate of nullable expression). Consider referencing only non-nullable values in SUM. ISNULL() may be useful for this. |
| 8663 | 16 | No | Cannot create the clustered index "%.\*ls" on view "%.\*ls" because its select list does not include COUNT_BIG(\*). Consider adding COUNT_BIG(\*) to the select list. |
| 8664 | 16 | No | An index cannot be created on the view '%.\*ls' because the view definition includes duplicate column names. |
| 8665 | 16 | No | Cannot create the clustered index "%.\*ls" on view "%.\*ls" because no row can satisfy the view definition. Consider eliminating contradictions from the view definition. |
| 8666 | 10 | No | Warning: The optimizer cannot use the index because the select list of the view contains a non-aggregate expression. |
| 8667 | 10 | No | Warning: The optimizer cannot use the index because the group-by list in the view forms a key and is redundant. |
| 8668 | 16 | No | Cannot create the clustered index '%.\*ls' on view '%.\*ls' because the select list of the view contains an expression on result of aggregate function or grouping column. Consider removing expression on result of aggregate function or grouping column from select list. |
| 8669 | 16 | No | The attempt to maintain the indexed view "%.\*ls" failed because it contains an expression on aggregate results, or because it contains a ranking or aggregate window function. Consider dropping the clustered index on the view, or changing the view definition. |
| 8670 | 16 | No | Query optimizer reached the internal limit of the maximum number of views that can be used during optimization. |
| 8671 | 16 | No | The attempt to maintain the indexed view "%.\*ls" failed because of the ignore_dup_key option on index "%.\*ls". Drop the index or re-create it without the ignore_dup_key index option. |
| 8672 | 16 | No | The MERGE statement attempted to UPDATE or DELETE the same row more than once. This happens when a target row matches more than one source row. A MERGE statement cannot UPDATE/DELETE the same row of the target table multiple times. Refine the ON clause to ensure a target row matches at most one source row, or use the GROUP BY clause to group the source rows. |
| 8673 | 16 | No | A MERGE statement is not valid if it triggers both the 'ON DELETE SET NULL' and 'ON UPDATE CASCADE' actions for a referential integrity constraint. Modify the actions performed by the MERGE statement to ensure that it does not trigger both these actions for a referential integrity constraint. |
| 8674 | 16 | No | The query processor is unable to produce a plan. The table '%.\*ls' is unavailable because the heap is corrupted. Take the database offline to rebuild the table and heap, and then run the query processor again. |
| 8676 | 16 | No | Invalid plan. |
| 8677 | 16 | No | Cannot create the clustered index '%.\*ls' on view '%.\*ls' because it does not aggregate results. Consider changing the view definition. |
| 8678 | 16 | No | Cannot create the clustered index "%.\*ls" on view "%.\*ls" because the view references a SUM aggregate of a nullable expression. Consider adding a new COUNT_BIG aggregate over such nullable expression. |
| [8680](../mssqlserver-8680-database-engine-error.md) | 17 | No | Internal Query Processor Error: The query processor encountered an unexpected error during the processing of a remote query phase. |
| 8681 | 17 | No | Internal Query Processor Error: The query processor encountered an unexpected error during processing. \[%ls\] |
| 8682 | 16 | No | SELECT via cursor failed because in XML plan provided to USE PLAN hint, neither Populate nor Fetch plans are provided, and at least one must be present. For best likelihood of successful plan forcing, use an XML cursor plan captured from SQL Server without modification. |
| 8683 | 16 | No | Could not force query plan because XML showplan provided in USE PLAN hint contains invalid Star Join specification. Consider specifying a USE PLAN hint that contains an unmodified XML showplan produced by SQL Server. This may allow you to force the plan. |
| 8684 | 16 | No | A query plan could not be found because optimizer exceeded number of allowed operations while searching for plan specified in USE PLAN hint. First consider removing USE PLAN hint. Then if necessary consider (1) updating statistics, (2) using other hints such as join hints, index hints, or the OPTIMIZE FOR hint, (3) rewriting query or breaking it down into two or more separate queries. |
| 8685 | 16 | No | Query cannot be compiled because \<CursorStmt\> element appears in XML plan provided to USE PLAN but USE PLAN was applied to a non-cursor statement. Consider using an XML plan obtained from SQL Server for statement without modification. |
| 8686 | 16 | No | Cursor plan forcing failed because input plan has more than one \<Operation\> node with OperationType=%ls. Consider using an XML cursor plan captured from SQL Server without modification. |
| 8687 | 16 | No | Cursor plan failed because it is not possible to force the plan for a cursor of type other than FAST_FORWARD or STATIC with a USE PLAN hint. Consider removing USE PLAN hint and updating statistics or using different hints to influence query plan choice. |
| 8688 | 16 | No | Cursor plan forcing failed because in XML plan provided to USE PLAN, required element %ls is missing under \<CursorPlan\> element. Consider using an XML cursor plan captured from SQL Server without modification. |
| [8689](../mssqlserver-8689-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | Database '%.\*ls', specified in the USE PLAN hint, does not exist. Specify an existing database. |
| 8690 | 16 | No | Query cannot be compiled because USE PLAN hint conflicts with hint %ls. Consider removing hint %ls. |
| 8691 | 16 | No | Query cannot be compiled because USE PLAN hint conflicts with SET %ls ON. Consider setting %ls OFF. |
| 8692 | 16 | No | %ls statement could not be executed because USE PLAN hint not supported for %ls. USE PLAN is only supported for SELECT. |
| 8693 | 16 | No | Cannot compile query because combination of LogicalOp = '%ls', PhysicalOp = '%ls', and sub_element = '%ls' under RelOp element in XML plan in USE PLAN hint is not valid. Use a recognized combination instead. Consider using an automatically generated XML plan without modification. |
| 8694 | 16 | No | Cannot execute query because USE PLAN hint conflicts with use of distributed query or full-text operations. Consider removing USE PLAN hint. |
| 8695 | 16 | No | Cannot execute query because of incorrectly formed XML plan in USE PLAN hint. Verify that XML plan is a legal plan suitable for plan forcing. See Books Online for additional details. |
| 8696 | 16 | No | Cannot run query because of improperly formed Spool element with parent RelOp with NodeId %d in XML plan in USE PLAN hint. Verify that each Spool element's parent RelOp has unique NodeId attribute, and each Spool element has either a single RelOp sub-element, or a PrimaryNodeId attribute, but not both. PrimaryNodeId of Spool must reference NodeId of an existing RelOp with a Spool sub-element. Consider using unmodified XML showplan as USE PLAN hint. |
| 8697 | 16 | No | Cannot run query because in XML plan provided to USE PLAN, element %ls must have %d %ls nodes as children, but has %d. |
| 8698 | 16 | No | Query processor could not produce query plan because USE PLAN hint contains plan that could not be verified to be legal for query. Remove or replace USE PLAN hint. For best likelihood of successful plan forcing, verify that the plan provided in the USE PLAN hint is one generated automatically by SQL Server for the same query. |
| 8699 | 16 | No | Cannot run query because it contains more than one USE PLAN hint. Use at most one USE PLAN hint. |
| 8700 | 16 | No | Query could not run because column store indexes on memory optimized tables are currently disabled. Rewrite the query with an index hint specifying a different index. |
| 8705 | 16 | No | A DML statement encountered a missing entry in index ID %d of table ID %d, in the database '%.\*ls' due to an interaction with another transaction. If you continue to see this error, consider using Repeatable Read or higher isolation level. |
| 8709 | 16 | No | Error due to negative or NULL window delimiter. |
| [8710](../mssqlserver-8710-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | Aggregate functions that are used with CUBE, ROLLUP, or GROUPING SET queries must provide for the merging of subaggregates. To fix this problem, remove the aggregate function or write the query using UNION ALL over GROUP BY clauses. |
| 8711 | 16 | No | Multiple ordered aggregate functions in the same scope have mutually incompatible orderings. |
| [8712](../mssqlserver-8712-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | Index '%.\*ls', specified in the USE PLAN hint, does not exist. Specify an existing index, or create an index with the specified name. |
| 8713 | 16 | No | Could not force query plan because of a problem in an indexed view referenced in the plan. |
| 8714 | 16 | No | Polybase Error: Failed to convert external data format to SQL Server internal format. |
| 8715 | 16 | No | Polybase Error: Failed to set physical layout for table given an external buffer layout. |
| 8716 | 16 | No | Invalid data was detected. An external producer has inserted a value into shared memory table that is not supported by SQL Server. |
| 8717 | 16 | No | DML Operations are not supported with external tables. |
| 8720 | 15 | No | Cannot execute query. There is more than one TABLE HINT clause specified for object '%.\*ls'. Use at most one such TABLE HINT clause per table reference. |
| 8721 | 15 | No | Cannot execute query. TABLE HINT in the OPTION clause leads to ambiguous reference for object '%.\*ls'. Consider USE PLAN query hint instead. |
| 8722 | 15 | No | Cannot execute query. Semantic affecting hint '%.\*ls' appears in the '%.\*ls' clause of object '%.\*ls' but not in the corresponding '%.\*ls' clause. Change the OPTION (TABLE HINTS...) clause so the semantic affecting hints match the WITH clause. |
| 8723 | 15 | No | Cannot execute query. Object '%.\*ls' is specified in the TABLE HINT clause, but is not used in the query or does not match the alias specified in the query. Table references in the TABLE HINT clause must match the WITH clause. |
| 8724 | 15 | No | Cannot execute query. Table-valued or OPENROWSET function '%.\*ls' cannot be specified in the TABLE HINT clause. |
| 8725 | 17 | No | Subproc thread aborted during parallel query execution. |
| 8726 | 16 | No | Input parameter of %.\*ls function must be a constant. |
| 8727 | 16 | No | Input parameter of percentile function is outside of range \[0, 1\]. |
| 8728 | 16 | No | ORDER BY list of RANGE window frame cannot contain expressions of LOB type. |
| 8729 | 16 | No | ORDER BY list of RANGE window frame has total size of %lu bytes. Largest size supported is %lu bytes. |
| 8730 | 16 | No | Offset parameter for Lag and Lead functions cannot be a negative value. |
| 8731 | 15 | No | REDISTRIBUTE and REDUCE hints expect the first join condition to be an equality comparison of columns with directly comparable types. Modify the query and re-run it. |
| 8732 | 15 | No | REPLICATE and REDUCE hints can only be used with inner joins. Modify the query and re-run it. |
| 8733 | 16 | No | Separator parameter for STRING_AGG must be a string literal or variable. |
| 8734 | 16 | No | Separator parameter for STRING_AGG cannot be large object type such as VARCHAR(MAX) or NVARCHAR(MAX). |
| 8735 | 16 | No | The operation failed because an online index build on the table terminated and caused a temporary inconsistency. Re-run the query. |
| 8736 | 16 | No | Input parameter cannot be large object type such as VARBINARY(MAX). |
| 8737 | 17 | No | Error 0x%X occurred when sending data over the network to another distribution. Please try to run the query again. If the error persists, please contact support. |
