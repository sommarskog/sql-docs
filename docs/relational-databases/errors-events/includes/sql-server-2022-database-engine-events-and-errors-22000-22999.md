| 22584 | 10 | No | Warning: Values of some of the flags specified in the 'schema_option' property are not compatible with the publication's compatibility level. The modified schema_option value of '%s' will be used instead. |
| 22585 | 10 | No | The schema option to script out the FILESTREAM attribute on varbinary(max) columns has been enabled for article '%s'. Enabling this option after the article is created can cause replication to fail when the data in a FILESTREAM column exceeds 2GB and there is a conflict during replication. If you want FILESTREAM data to be replicated, drop and re-create the article, and specify the appropriate schema option when you re-create the article. |
| 22586 | 16 | No | Column '%s' cannot be added or modified in article '%s' of publication '%s'. The DDL operatoin on hierarchyid and FILESTREAM columns is not supported for publications that have a 'sync_mode' of 1 (character mode) or with a lower than 90RTM backward compatibility level. |

| 22977 | 16 | No | Unable to update DDL history information to reflect columns changes applied to the tracked table associated with change table '%s'. Refer to previous errors in the current session to identify the cause and correct any associated problems. |
| 22978 | 16 | No | Could not update the cdc.captured_columns entry for column '%s' of change table '%s' to reflect a data type change in the corresponding column of the source table '%s'. Change Data Capture column meta data for table '%s' no longer accurately reflects the source table. Refer to previous errors in the current session to identify the cause and correct any associated problems. |
| 22979 | 16 | No | The unique index '%s' on table '%s' is used by Change Data Capture. The constraint using this index cannot be dropped or disabled. |
| 22980 | 16 | No | The unique index '%s' on table '%s.%s' is disabled and cannot be used as a unique index by Change Data Capture. Enable the index. |
| 22981 | 16 | No | Object does not exist or access is denied. |
| 22982 | 16 | No | Could not create internal stored procedures used to populate the change table for capture instance '%s' and source table '%s.%s'. Refer to previous errors in the current session to identify the cause and correct any associated problems. |
| 22983 | 16 | No | The unique index '%s' on source table '%s' is used by Change Data Capture. To alter or drop the index, you must first disable Change Data Capture on the table. |
| 22984 | 16 | No | An error occurred while waiting on the log reader history cache event. This error is reported by the internal task scheduling and might be transient. Retry the operation. |
| 22985 | 16 | No | Change data capture has not been enabled for source table '%s.%s'. Specify the name of a table enabled for Change Data Capture. To report on the tables enabled for Change Data Capture, query the is_tracked_by_cdc column in the sys.tables catalog view. |
| 22986 | 16 | No | Could not allocate memory for Change Data Capture population. Verify that SQL Server has sufficient memory for all operations. Check the physical and virtual memory settings on the server and examine memory usage to see if another application is consuming excessive memory. |
| 22987 | 16 | No | Change Data Capture population failed writing blob data for one or more large object columns. Verify that SQL Server has sufficient memory for all operations. Check the physical and virtual memory settings on the server and examine memory usage to see if another application is consuming excessive memory. |
| 22988 | 16 | No | This instance of SQL Server is the %s. Change data capture is only available in the Enterprise, Developer, Enterprise Evaluation, and Standard editions. |
| 22989 | 16 | No | Could not enable Change Data Capture for database '%s'. Change data capture is not supported on system databases, or on a distribution database. |
| 22990 | 16 | No | The value specified for the parameter @pollinginterval must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than 24 hours(Max: 86399 seconds). Specify a polling interval (in seconds) that is less than 24 hours (86,400 seconds). |
| 22991 | 16 | No | The value specified for the parameter @maxtrans must be greater than 0. |
| 22992 | 16 | No | The specified @job_type, %s, is not supported. The value specified for the parameter @job_type must be N'capture' to indicate a capture job, or N'cleanup' to indicate a cleanup job. |
| 22993 | 16 | No | The Change Data Capture job table containing job information for database '%s' cannot be found in the msdb system database. Run the stored procedure 'sys.sp_cdc_add_job' to create the appropriate CDC capture or cleanup job. The stored procedure will create the required job table. |
| 22994 | 16 | No | The retention value specified for the Change Data Capture cleanup process must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 52594800. When creating or modifying the cleanup job, specify a retention value (in minutes) that is within that range. If this error is encountered when executing the sys.sp_cdc_cleanup_change_table stored procedure, reset the retention value associated with the job to a non-negative value less than 52594800 by using the sp_cdc_change_job stored procedure. |
| 22995 | 16 | No | A value for the parameter @retention cannot be specified when the job type is 'capture'. Specify NULL for the parameter, or omit the parameter from the statement. |
| 22996 | 16 | No | When adding or modifying the CDC cleanup job, @pollinginterval, @maxtrans, @maxscans, and @continuous may not be assigned non-null values. |
| 22997 | 16 | No | The Change Data Capture '%s' job does not exist in the system table 'msdb.dbo.cdc_jobs'. Use the stored procedure 'sys.sp_cdc_add_job' to add the Change Data Capture job. |
| 22998 | 16 | No | The value specified for the parameter @continuous must be 0 or 1. |
| 22999 | 16 | No | The value specified for the parameter @pollinginterval must be null or 0 when the stored procedure 'sys.sp_cdc_scan' is not being run in continuous mode. |
