| 1425 | 16 | No | The property value is invalid for '%.\*ls'. Property value not changed. |
| 1426 | 16 | No | To issue ALTER DATABASE SET WITNESS, all three server instances must be interconnected, and the mirror database must be caught up. When these conditions are met, reissue the command. |
| 1427 | 16 | No | The server instance '%.\*ls' could not act as the witness. The ALTER DATABASE SET WITNESS command failed. |
| 1428 | 16 | No | The request is refused because the responding server instance is not in a state to service the request. |
| 1429 | 16 | No | The witness server instance name must be distinct from both of the server instances that manage the database. The ALTER DATABASE SET WITNESS command failed. |
| 1430 | 16 | No | Database '%.\*ls' is in an unstable state for removing database mirroring, so recovery may fail. Verify the data after recovery. |
| 1431 | 16 | No | Neither the partner nor the witness server instance for database "%.\*ls" is available. Reissue the command when at least one of the instances becomes available. |
| 1432 | 10 | No | Database mirroring is attempting to repair physical page %S_PGID in database "%.\*ls" by requesting a copy from the partner. |
| 1433 | 16 | No | All three server instances did not remain interconnected for the duration of the ALTER DATABASE SET WITNESS command. There may be no witness associated with the database. Verify the status and when necessary repeat the command. |

| 1437 | 16 | Yes | Could not post message '%ls' from server instance '%ls' because there is insufficient memory. Reduce non-essential memory load or increase system memory. |
| 1438 | 16 | Yes | The server instance %ls rejected configure request; read its error log file for more information. The reason %u, and state %u, can be of use for diagnostics by Microsoft. This is a transient error hence retrying the request is likely to succeed. Correct the cause if any and retry. |
| 1439 | 16 | No | There is currently no witness associated with database "%.\*ls". |
| 1440 | 10 | Yes | Database mirroring is active with database '%.\*ls' as the principal copy. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 1441 | 10 | Yes | Database mirroring is active with database '%.\*ls' as the mirror copy. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 1442 | 10 | Yes | Database mirroring is inactive for database '%.\*ls'. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 1443 | 10 | Yes | Database mirroring has been terminated for database '%.\*ls'. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 1444 | 10 | Yes | Bypassing recovery for database '%ls' because it is marked as a mirror database, which cannot be recovered. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 1445 | 10 | Yes | Bypassing recovery for database '%ls' because it is marked as an inaccessible database mirroring database. A problem exists with the mirroring session. The session either lacks a quorum or the communications links are broken because of problems with links, endpoint configuration, or permissions (for the server account or security certificate). To gain access to the database, figure out what has changed in the session configuration and undo the change. |
| 1446 | 10 | No | The "%.\*ls" server instance is already acting as the witness. |
| 1447 | 16 | No | ALTER DATABASE "%.\*ls" command cannot be executed until both partner server instances are up, running, and connected. Start the partner and reissue the command. |
| 1448 | 16 | No | The remote copy of database "%.\*ls" does not exist. Check the database name and reissue the command. |
| 1449 | 16 | No | ALTER DATABASE command failed due to an invalid server connection string. |
| 1450 | 16 | No | The ALTER DATABASE command failed because the worker thread cannot be created. |
| 1451 | 16 | No | Database mirroring information was not found in the system table. |
| 1452 | 16 | No | The partner server instance name must be distinct from the server instance that manages the database. The ALTER DATABASE SET PARTNER command failed. |
| 1453 | 17 | Yes | '%.\*ls', the remote mirroring partner for database '%.\*ls', encountered error %d, status %d, severity %d. Database mirroring has been suspended. Resolve the error on the remote server and resume mirroring, or remove mirroring and re-establish the mirror server instance. |
| 1454 | 17 | Yes | Database mirroring will be suspended. Server instance '%.\*ls' encountered error %d, state %d, severity %d when it was acting as a mirroring partner for database '%.\*ls'. The database mirroring partners might try to recover automatically from the error and resume the mirroring session. For more information, view the error log for additional error messages. |
