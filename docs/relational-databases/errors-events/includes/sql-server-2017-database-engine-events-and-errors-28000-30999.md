| 28099 | 10 | No | During the database upgrade process on database '%.\*ls', a user object '%S_MSG' named '%.\*ls' was found to already exist. That object is now reserved by the system in this version of SQL Server. Because it already exists in the database, the upgrade process is unable to install the object. Remove or rename the user object from the original (pre-upgraded) database on an older version of SQL Server and then retry the database upgrade process by using CREATE DATABASE FOR ATTACH. Functionality that relies on the reserved object may not function correctly if you continue to use the database in the current state. |
| 28101 | 16 | No | User '%.\*ls\%.\*ls' does not have permission to debug the requested client connection. |

| 28389 | 16 | No | Target with the clone address: IdxId %d, DbFragId %d, RowsetId 0x%016I64X is not found at brick %d. Possibly caused by invalid IDs or by an inconsistency between the IDs and the fragmentation function. |
| 28390 | 16 | No | Invalid clone address syntax: IdxId %d, DbFragId %d, RowsetId 0x%016I64X. |
| 28391 | 16 | No | The use of internal Clone Addressability syntax extensions is incompatible with the feature '%.\*ls'. |
| 28392 | 16 | No | The internal Clone Addressability syntax extensions is only allowed on user tables. The target (in the FROM claus) is '%.\*ls'. |
| 28393 | 16 | No | The index (id = %d) selected in the plan is inconsistent with the index specified in the clone address syntax (id = %d). |
| 28394 | 16 | No | The query plan uses the feature '%.\*ls' which is unexpected with clone address syntax. |
| 28395 | 16 | No | Multiple conflicting Ids are given on '%.\*ls': old value = %d, new value = %d. |
| 28396 | 16 | No | Invalid clone address syntax: IdxId %d, DbFragId %d, RowsetId 0x%016I64X. (If you see this error, it implies there is a bug in the code.) |
| 28397 | 16 | No | Unable to activate query fragment. |

| 30055 | 10 | No | Full-text catalog import has started for full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%ls'. |
| 30056 | 10 | No | Full-text catalog import has finished for full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%ls'. %d fragments and %d keywords were processed. |
| 30057 | 10 | No | Upgrade option '%ls' is being used for full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%ls'. |
| 30058 | 16 | No | Properties of zero length cannot be added to a search property list. Specify a search property name that contains at least one character and that is unique to the specified search property list. For a list of the search properties on the current database, use the sys.registered_search_properties catalog view. |
| 30059 | 16 | No | A fatal error occurred during a full-text population and caused the population to be cancelled. Population type is: %s; database name is %s (id: %d); catalog name is %s (id: %d); table name %s (id: %d). Fix the errors that are logged in the full-text crawl log. Then, resume the population. The basic Transact-SQL syntax for this is: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON table_name RESUME POPULATION. |
| 30060 | 16 | No | The import population for database %ls (id: %d), catalog %ls (id: %d) is being cancelled because of a fatal error ('%ls'). Fix the errors that are logged in the full-text crawl log. Then resume the import either by detaching the database and re-attaching it, or by taking the database offline and bringing it back online. If the error is not recoverable, rebuild the full-text catalog. |
| 30061 | 17 | No | The SQL Server failed to create full-text filterdata directory. This might be because FulltextDefaultPath is invalid or SQL Server service account does not have permission. Full-text blob indexing will fail until this issue is resolved. Restart SQL Server after the issue is fixed. |
| 30062 | 17 | No | The SQL Server failed to load FDHost service group sid. This might be because installation is corrupted. |
| 30063 | 10 | No | Warning: SQL Server could not set fdhost.exe processor affinity to %d because the value is not valid. |
| 30064 | 17 | No | SQL Server failed to set security information on the full-text FilterData directory in the FTData folder. Full-text indexing of some types of documents may fail until this issue is resolved. You will need to repair the SQL Server installation. |
| 30065 | 10 | No | Filegroup '%ls' is offline, readonly, or no data file. Full-text population on table '%ls' is not resumed. Resume full-text population after fixing the filegroup status. |
| 30067 | 10 | No | Warning: The detach operation cannot delete a full-text index created on table '%ls' in database '%ls' because the index is on a read-only filegroup. To drop the full-text index, re-attach the database, change the read-only filegroup to read/write access and then detach it. This warning will not fail the database detach operation. |
| 30068 | 10 | No | During the database upgrade, the full-text filter component '%ls' that is used by catalog '%ls' was successfully verified. Component version is '%ls'; Full path is '%.\*ls'. |
| 30069 | 11 | No | The full-text filter component '%ls' used to populate catalog '%ls' in a previous SQL Server release is not the current version (component version is '%ls', full path is '%.\*ls'). This may cause search results to differ slightly from previous releases. To avoid this, rebuild the full-text catalog using the current version of the filter component. |
| 30070 | 10 | No | During the database upgrade, the full-text word-breaker component '%ls' that is used by catalog '%ls' was successfully verified. Component version is '%ls'. Full path is '%.\*ls'. Language requested is %d. Language used is %d. |
| 30071 | 11 | No | The full-text word-breaker component '%ls' used to populate catalog '%ls' in a previous SQL Server release is not the current version (component version is '%ls', full path is '%.\*ls', language requested is %d, language used is %d). This may cause search results to differ slightly from previous releases. To avoid this, rebuild the full-text catalog using the current version of the word-breaker component. |
| 30072 | 10 | No | During the database upgrade, the full-text protocol handler component '%ls' that is used by catalog '%ls' was successfully verified. Component version is '%ls'. Full path is '%.\*ls'. Program ID is '%.\*ls'. |
| 30073 | 11 | No | The full-text protocol handler component '%ls' used to populate catalog '%ls' in a previous SQL Server release is not the current version (component version is '%ls', full path is '%.\*ls', program ID is '%.\*ls'). This may cause search results to differ slightly from previous releases. To avoid this, rebuild the full-text catalog using the current version of the protocol handler component. |
| 30074 | 17 | No | The master merge of full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%.\*ls' was cancelled. |
| 30075 | 10 | No | Full-text crawls for database ID: %d, table ID: %d, catalog ID: %d will be stopped since the clustered index on the table has been altered or dropped. Crawl will need to re-start from the beginning. |
| 30076 | 10 | No | Full-text crawl forward progress information for database ID: %d, table ID: %d, catalog ID: %d has been reset due to the modification of the clustered index. Crawl will re-start from the beginning when it is unpaused. |
| 30077 | 16 | No | The full-text query did not use the value specified for the OPTIMIZE FOR query hint. Only single terms are allowed as values for full-text queries that contain an OPTIMIZE FOR query hint. Modify the OPTIMIZE FOR query hint value to be a single, non-empty term. |
| 30078 | 10 | No | The fulltext query did not use the value specified for the OPTIMIZE FOR hint because the query contained more than one type of full-text logical operator. |
| 30079 | 10 | No | The full text query ignored UNKNOWN in the OPTIMIZE FOR hint. |
| 30080 | 16 | No | The full-text population on table '%ls' cannot be started because the full-text catalog is importing data from existing catalogs. After the import operation finishes, rerun the command. |
| 30081 | 10 | No | A cached plan was compiled using trace flags that are incompatible with the current values. Consider recompiling the query with the new trace flag settings. |
| 30082 | 16 | No | Full-text predicates cannot appear in an aggregate expression. Place the aggregate expression in a subquery. |
| 30083 | 16 | No | Full-text predicates cannot appear in the GROUP BY clause. Place a GROUP BY clause expression in a subquery. |
| 30084 | 16 | No | The full-text index cannot be created because filegroup '%.\*ls' does not exist or the filegroup name is incorrectly specified. Specify a valid filegroup name. |
| 30085 | 16 | No | A stoplist cache cannot be generated while processing a full-text query or performing full-text indexing. There is not enough memory to load the stoplist cache. Rerun the query or indexing command when more resources are available. |
| 30086 | 16 | No | The system ran out of memory while building a full-text index. The batch for the full-text indexing operation will automatically be retried using a smaller batch size. |
| 30087 | 17 | No | Data coming back to the SQL Server process from the filter daemon host is corrupted. This may be caused by a bad filter. The batch for the indexing operation will automatically be retried using a smaller batch size. |
| 30088 | 10 | No | The full-text filter daemon host process has stopped normally. The process will be automatically restarted if necessary. |
| [30089](../mssqlserver-30089-database-engine-error.md) | 17 | No | The fulltext filter daemon host (FDHost) process has stopped abnormally. This can occur if an incorrectly configured or malfunctioning linguistic component, such as a wordbreaker, stemmer or filter has caused an irrecoverable error during full-text indexing or query processing. The process will be restarted automatically. |
| 30090 | 10 | No | A new instance of the full-text filter daemon host process has been successfully started. |
| 30091 | 10 | No | A request to start a full-text index population on table or indexed view '%.\*ls' is ignored because a population is currently paused. Either resume or stop the paused population. To resume it, use the following Transact-SQL statement: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON %.\*ls RESUME POPULATION. To stop it, use the following statement: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON %.\*ls STOP POPULATION. |
| 30092 | 16 | No | Full-text stoplist ID '%d' does not exist. |
| 30093 | 17 | No | The SQL Server word-breaking client failed to initialize. This might be because a filter daemon host process is not in a valid state. This can prevent SQL Server from initializing critical system objects. Full-text queries will fail until this issue is resolved. Try stopping SQL Server and any filter daemon host processes and then restarting the instance of SQL Server. |
| 30094 | 17 | No | The full-text indexing pipeline could not be initialized. This might be because the resources on the system are too low to allocate memory or create tasks. Try restarting the instance of SQL Server. |
| 30095 | 10 | No | The version of the language components used by full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%ls' is different from the version of the language components included this version of SQL Server. The full-text catalog will still be imported as part of database upgrade. To avoid any possible inconsistencies of query results, consider rebuilding the full-text catalog. |
| 30096 | 10 | No | A full-text retry pass of %ls population started for table or indexed view '%ls'. Table or indexed view ID is '%d'. Database ID is '%d'. |
| 30097 | 10 | No | The fulltext catalog upgrade failed because of an inconsistency in metadata between sys.master_files and sys.fulltext_catalogs for the catalog ID %d in database ID %d. Try to reattach this database. If this fails, then the catalog will need to be dropped or recreated before attach. |
| 30098 | 10 | No | An internal query to load data for a crawl on database '%.\*ls' and table '%.\*ls' failed with error code %d. Check the sql error code for more information about the condition causing this failure. The crawl needs to be restarted after this condition is removed. |
| 30099 | 17 | No | Fulltext internal error |
| 30101 | 16 | No | The parameter '%s' is mandatory in stored procedure '%s'. |

| 30112 | 16 | No | Insert brick into metadata operation failed during execution of stored procedure '%s'. |
| 30113 | 16 | No | Insert manager into metadata operation failed during execution of stored procedure '%s'. |
| 30114 | 16 | No | Insert parameter into metadata operation failed during execution of stored procedure '%s'. |
| 30115 | 16 | No | No more bricks can be reserved. The maximum amount of %lu bricks is reached. |
| 30118 | 16 | No | Invalid server name provided to configure a matrix brick. |
| 30119 | 16 | No | Invalid CM brick GUID. |
| 30120 | 16 | No | Invalid brick GUID. |
| 30121 | 16 | No | '%s' in only allowed in standalone (non matrix) mode. |
| 30122 | 16 | No | '%s' in only allowed in single user (-m) mode. |
| 30123 | 16 | No | Drop existing matrix configuration failed during execution of stored procedure '%s'. |
| 30124 | 16 | No | An error occurred while updating the CM metadata to remove a brick. |
| 30125 | 16 | No | Configuration manager could not write the WMI offline configuration file during the execution of stored procedure '%s'. |
| 30126 | 16 | No | Could not complete the last operation with the brick_id %u due a metadata failure |
| 30127 | 16 | No | Attempt to cancel the reservation of a brick that is not reserved: %u |
| 30128 | 16 | No | The stored procedure '%s' failed with the error code %d |
