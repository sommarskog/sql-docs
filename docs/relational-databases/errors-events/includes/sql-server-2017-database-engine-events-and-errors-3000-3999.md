| Error | Severity | Event logged | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3001 | 16 | No | obsolete |
| 3002 | 16 | No | Cannot BACKUP or RESTORE a database snapshot. |
| 3003 | 10 | No | This BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL will be based on more than one file backup. All those file backups must be restored before attempting to restore this differential backup. |
| 3004 | 16 | No | The primary filegroup cannot be backed up as a file backup because the database is using the SIMPLE recovery model. Consider taking a partial backup by specifying READ_WRITE_FILEGROUPS. |
| 3005 | 10 | No | The differential partial backup is including a read-only filegroup, '%ls'. This filegroup was read-write when the base partial backup was created, but was later changed to read-only access. We recommend that you create a separate file backup of the '%ls' filegroup now, and then create a new partial backup to provide a new base for later differential partial backups. |
| 3006 | 16 | No | The differential backup is not allowed because it would be based on more than one base backup. Multi-based differential backups are not allowed in the simple recovery model, and are never allowed for partial differential backups. |
| 3007 | 16 | No | The backup of the file or filegroup "%ls" is not permitted because it is not online. Container state: "%ls" (%d). Restore status: %d. BACKUP can be performed by using the FILEGROUP or FILE clauses to restrict the selection to include only online data. |
| 3008 | 16 | No | The specified device type is not supported for backup mirroring. |
| 3009 | 16 | No | Could not insert a backup or restore history/detail record in the msdb database. This may indicate a problem with the msdb database. The backup/restore operation was still successful. |
| 3010 | 16 | No | Invalid backup mirror specification. All mirrors must have the same number of members. |
| 3011 | 16 | No | All backup devices must be of the same general class (for example, DISK and TAPE). |
| 3012 | 17 | No | VDI ran out of buffer when SQL Server attempted to send differential information to SQL Writer. |
| [3013](../mssqlserver-3013-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | %hs is terminating abnormally. |
| 3014 | 10 | No | %hs successfully processed %I64d pages in %d.%03d seconds (%d.%03d MB/sec). |
| 3015 | 10 | No | %hs is not yet implemented. |
| 3016 | 16 | No | Backup of file '%ls' is not permitted because it contains pages subject to an online restore sequence. Complete the restore sequence before taking the backup, or restrict the backup to exclude this file. |
| 3017 | 16 | No | The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' could not be opened. Operating system error '%ls'. Correct the problem, or reissue the command without RESTART. |
| 3018 | 10 | No | The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' was not found. The RESTORE command will continue from the beginning as if RESTART had not been specified. |
| 3019 | 16 | No | The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' is from a previous interrupted RESTORE operation and is inconsistent with the current RESTORE command. The restart command must use the same syntax as the interrupted command, with the addition of the RESTART clause. Alternatively, reissue the current statement without the RESTART clause. |
| 3021 | 16 | No | Cannot perform a backup or restore operation within a transaction. |
| 3022 | 10 | No | This backup is a file backup of read-write data from a database that uses the simple recovery model. This is only appropriate if you plan to set the filegroup to read-only followed by a differential file backup. Consult Books Online for more information on managing read-only data for the simple recovery model. In particular, consider how partial backups are used. |
| [3023](../mssqlserver-3023-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | Backup, file manipulation operations (such as ALTER DATABASE ADD FILE) and encryption changes on a database must be serialized. Reissue the statement after the current backup or file manipulation operation is completed. |
| 3024 | 16 | No | You can only perform a full backup of the master database. Use BACKUP DATABASE to back up the entire master database. |
| 3025 | 16 | No | Missing database name. Reissue the statement specifying a valid database name. |
| 3027 | 16 | No | The filegroup "%.\*ls" is not part of database "%.\*ls". |
| 3028 | 10 | No | The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' was corrupted and is being ignored. The RESTORE command will continue from the beginning as if RESTART had not been specified. |
| 3031 | 16 | No | Option '%ls' conflicts with option(s) '%ls'. Remove the conflicting option and reissue the statement. |
| 3032 | 16 | No | One or more of the options (%ls) are not supported for this statement. Review the documentation for supported options. |
| 3033 | 16 | No | BACKUP DATABASE cannot be used on a database opened in emergency mode. |
| 3034 | 16 | No | No files were selected to be processed. You may have selected one or more filegroups that have no members. |
| 3035 | 16 | No | Cannot perform a differential backup for database "%ls", because a current database backup does not exist. Perform a full database backup by reissuing BACKUP DATABASE, omitting the WITH DIFFERENTIAL option. |
| 3036 | 16 | No | The database "%ls" is in warm-standby state (set by executing RESTORE WITH STANDBY) and cannot be backed up until the entire restore sequence is completed. |
| 3038 | 16 | No | The file name "%ls" is invalid as a backup device name. Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid file name. |
| 3039 | 16 | No | Cannot perform a differential backup for file '%ls' because a current file backup does not exist. Reissue BACKUP DATABASE omitting the WITH DIFFERENTIAL option. |
| 3040 | 10 | No | An error occurred while informing replication of the backup. The backup will continue, but the replication environment should be inspected. |
| 3041 | 16 | Yes | BACKUP failed to complete the command %.\*ls. Check the backup application log for detailed messages. |
| 3042 | 10 | No | BACKUP WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR successfully generated a backup of the damaged database. Refer to the SQL Server error log for information about the errors that were encountered. |
| [3043](../mssqlserver-3043-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | BACKUP '%ls' detected an error on page (%d:%d) in file '%ls'. |
| 3044 | 16 | No | Invalid zero-length device name. Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid device name. |
| 3045 | 16 | No | BACKUP or RESTORE requires the NTFS file system for FILESTREAM and full-text support. The path "%.\*ls" is not usable. |
| 3046 | 16 | No | Inconsistent metadata has been encountered. The only possible backup operation is a tail-log backup using the WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR or NO_TRUNCATE option. |
| 3047 | 16 | No | The BackupDirectory registry key is not configured correctly. This key should specify the root path where disk backup files are stored when full path names are not provided. This path is also used to locate restart checkpoint files for RESTORE. |
| 3048 | 16 | No | BACKUP LOG WITH TRUNCATE_ONLY cannot operate on database '%ls' because it is configured for database mirroring. |
| 3049 | 16 | No | BACKUP detected corruption in the database log. Check the errorlog for more information. |
| 3050 | 16 | No | SQL Server could not send the differential information for database file '%ls' of database '%ls\\%ls' to the backup application because the differential information is too large to fit in memory, and an attempt to use a temporary file has failed. |
| 3051 | 16 | No | BACKUP LOG was unable to maintain mirroring consistency for database '%ls'. Database mirroring has been suspended. |
| 3052 | 16 | No | BACKUP LOG was unable to log updates for for database '%ls'. Subsequent log backups will be required to advance the backup point from %S_LSN to %S_LSN after log space is made available for logging them. |
| 3053 | 16 | No | BACKUP '%ls' detected an error on a page in file '%ls'. |
| 3054 | 16 | No | Differential file backups can include only read-only data for databases using the simple recovery model. Consider taking a partial backup by specifying READ_WRITE_FILEGROUPS. |
| 3055 | 16 | No | Backup destination "%.\*ls" supports a FILESTREAM filegroup. This filegroup cannot be used as a backup destination. Rerun the BACKUP statement with a valid backup destination. |
| [3056](../mssqlserver-3056-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | The backup operation has detected an unexpected file in a FILESTREAM container. The backup operation will continue and include file '%ls'. |
| 3057 | 16 | No | Invalid device name. The length of the device name provided exceeds supported limit (maximum length is:%d). Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid device name. |
| 3058 | 10 | No | File or device name exceeds the supported limit (maximum length is:%d) and will be truncated: %.\*ls. |
| 3059 | 16 | No | This BACKUP or RESTORE command is not supported on a database mirror or secondary replica. |
| 3060 | 10 | No | The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' was corrupted. The restored database can not be recovered. Restart the RESTORE sequence. |
| 3061 | 16 | No | The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' could not be opened. Operating system error '%ls'. Make the file available and retry the operation or, restart the RESTORE sequence. |
| 3062 | 16 | No | Cannot backup from a HADRON secondary because it is not in Synchronizing or Synchronized state. |
| 3063 | 16 | No | Write to backup block blob device %ls failed. Device has reached its limit of allowed blocks. |
| 3064 | 16 | No | Write to backup block blob detected out of order write at offset %ld, last block offset was at %ld. |
| 3065 | 16 | No | Attempt to commit the block list for a block blob failed. Blob Name is "%.\*ls". Storage Errorcode %ld. |
| 3066 | 16 | No | Could not find the database file referenced by the file snapshot %.\*ls. Please make sure that the URL points to a valid snapshot on a database file. |
| 3067 | 16 | No | Failed while trying to delete file snapshot %.\*ls. Error code %ld. |
| 3068 | 16 | No | Invalid file snapshot URL. Please make sure that the URL is correctly formed. |
| 3069 | 16 | No | Striping a backup set across multiple devices is not permitted for file snapshot backups. |
| 3070 | 16 | No | Specifying the WITH options FORMAT and FILE_SNAPSHOT is not permitted. |
| 3071 | 16 | No | The database %.\*ls is configured for file snapshot point in time restore, log backups are not permitted. |
| 3072 | 16 | No | Backup encryption is incompatible with file snapshot backup if TDE is not enabled on the database. |
| 3073 | 16 | No | The option WITH FILE_SNAPSHOT is only permitted if all database files are in Azure Storage. |
| 3074 | 16 | No | Failed while getting attributes for the file snapshot %.\*ls. Error code %ld. |
| 3075 | 16 | No | Device name '%.\*ls' is not a valid MOVE target when restoring from a File Snapshot Backup. |
| 3076 | 16 | No | File Snapshot Backup is only permitted with a single backup device and no additonal mirrored devices. |
| 3077 | 10 | No | File snapshot %.\*ls not found. |
| 3078 | 16 | No | The file name "%ls" is invalid as a backup device name for the specified device type. Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid file name and device type. |
| 3095 | 16 | No | The backup cannot be performed because 'ENCRYPTION' was requested after the media was formatted with an incompatible structure. To append to this media set, either omit 'ENCRYPTION' or create a new media set by using WITH FORMAT in your BACKUP statement. If you use WITH FORMAT on an existing media set, all its backup sets will be overwritten. |
| 3096 | 16 | No | The Certificate specified for backup encryption has expired. |
| 3097 | 16 | No | The Backup cannot be performed because the existing media set is formatted with an incompatible version. |
| 3098 | 16 | No | The backup cannot be performed because '%ls' was requested after the media was formatted with an incompatible structure. To append to this media set, either omit '%ls' or specify '%ls'. Alternatively, you can create a new media set by using WITH FORMAT in your BACKUP statement. If you use WITH FORMAT on an existing media set, all its backup sets will be overwritten. |
| 3099 | 16 | No | Backup Encryption options were specified, Backup Encryption support has not been enabled on this version. |
| 3101 | 16 | No | Exclusive access could not be obtained because the database is in use. |
| 3102 | 16 | No | %ls cannot process database '%ls' because it is in use by this session. It is recommended that the master database be used when performing this operation. |
| 3103 | 16 | No | A partial restore sequence cannot be initiated by this command. To initiate a partial restore sequence, use the WITH PARTIAL clause of the RESTORE statement and provide a backup set which includes a full copy of at least the primary data file. The WITH PARTIAL clause of the RESTORE statement may not be used for any other purpose. |
| 3104 | 16 | No | RESTORE cannot operate on database '%ls' because it is configured for database mirroring or has joined an availability group. If you intend to restore the database, use ALTER DATABASE to remove mirroring or to remove the database from its availability group. |
| 3105 | 16 | No | RESTORE cannot restore any more pages into file '%ls' because the maximum number of pages (%d) are already being restored. Either complete the restore sequence for the existing pages, or use RESTORE FILE to restore all pages in the file. |
| 3106 | 16 | No | The filegroup "%ls" is ambiguous. The identity in the backup set does not match the filegroup that is currently defined in the online database. To force the use of the filegroup in the backup set, take the database offline and then reissue the RESTORE command. |
| 3107 | 16 | No | The file "%ls" is ambiguous. The identity in the backup set does not match the file that is currently defined in the online database. To force the use of the file in the backup set, take the database offline and then reissue the RESTORE command. |
| 3108 | 16 | No | To restore the master database, the server must be running in single-user mode. For information on starting in single-user mode, see "How to: Start an Instance of SQL Server (sqlservr.exe)" in Books Online. |
| 3109 | 16 | No | Master can only be restored and fully recovered in a single step using a full database backup. Options such as NORECOVERY, STANDBY, and STOPAT are not supported. |
| 3110 | 14 | No | User does not have permission to RESTORE database '%.\*ls'. |
| 3111 | 16 | No | Page %S_PGID is a control page which cannot be restored in isolation. To repair this page, the entire file must be restored. |
| 3112 | 16 | No | Cannot restore any database other than master when the server is in single user mode. |
| 3113 | 16 | No | Invalid data was detected. |
| 3115 | 16 | No | The database is using the simple recovery model. It is not possible to restore a subset of the read-write data. |
| 3116 | 16 | No | The supplied backup is not on the same recovery path as the database, and is ineligible for use for an online file restore. |
| 3117 | 16 | No | The log or differential backup cannot be restored because no files are ready to rollforward. |
| 3118 | 16 | No | The database "%ls" does not exist. RESTORE can only create a database when restoring either a full backup or a file backup of the primary file. |
| 3119 | 16 | No | Problems were identified while planning for the RESTORE statement. Previous messages provide details. |
| 3120 | 16 | No | This backup set will not be restored because all data has already been restored to a point beyond the time covered by this backup set. |
| 3121 | 16 | No | The file "%ls" is on a recovery path that is inconsistent with application of this backup set. RESTORE cannot continue. |
| 3122 | 16 | No | File initialization failed. RESTORE cannot continue. |
| 3123 | 16 | No | Invalid database name '%.\*ls' specified for backup or restore operation. |
| 3125 | 16 | No | The database is using the simple recovery model. The data in the backup it is not consistent with the current state of the database. Restoring more data is required before recovery is possible. Either restore a full file backup taken since the data was marked read-only, or restore the most recent base backup for the target data followed by a differential file backup. |
| 3126 | 16 | No | The file "%ls" was not relocated using a relative path during the RESTORE step. A relative location is required when restoring a database from a standalone instance to a matrix instance. Use the WITH MOVE option to specify a relative location for the file. |
| 3127 | 16 | Yes | The file '%.\*ls' of restored database '%ls' is being left in the defunct state because the database is using the simple recovery model and the file is marked for read-write access. Therefore, only read-only files can be recovered by piecemeal restore. |
| 3128 | 16 | No | File '%ls' has an unsupported page size (%d). |
| 3129 | 16 | No | The contents of the file "%ls" are not consistent with a transition into the restore sequence. A restore from a backup set may be required. |
| 3130 | 10 | No | The filegroup "%ls" is selected. At the time of backup it was known by the name "%ls"'. RESTORE will continue operating upon the renamed filegroup. |
| 3131 | 10 | No | The file "%ls" is selected. At the time of backup it was known by the name "%ls". RESTORE will continue operating upon the renamed file. |
| 3132 | 16 | No | The media set has %d media families but only %d are provided. All members must be provided. |
| 3133 | 16 | No | The volume on device "%ls" is sequence number %d of media family %d, but sequence number %d of media family %d is expected. Check that the device specifications and loaded media are correct. |
| 3134 | 10 | Yes | The differential base attribute for file '%ls' of database '%ls' has been reset because the file has been restored from a backup taken on a conflicting recovery path. The restore was allowed because the file was read-only and was consistent with the current status of the database. Any future differential backup of this file will require a new differential base. |
| 3135 | 16 | No | The backup set in file '%ls' was created by %hs and cannot be used for this restore operation. |
| 3136 | 16 | No | This differential backup cannot be restored because the database has not been restored to the correct earlier state. |
| 3137 | 16 | No | Database cannot be reverted. Either the primary or the snapshot names are improperly specified, all other snapshots have not been dropped, or there are missing files. |
| 3138 | 16 | No | The database cannot be reverted because FILESTREAM BLOBs are present. |
| 3139 | 16 | No | Restore to snapshot is not allowed with the master database. |
| 3140 | 16 | No | Could not adjust the space allocation for file '%ls'. |
| 3141 | 16 | No | The database to be restored was named '%ls'. Reissue the statement using the WITH REPLACE option to overwrite the '%ls' database. |
| 3142 | 16 | No | File "%ls" cannot be restored over the existing "%ls". Reissue the RESTORE statement using WITH REPLACE to overwrite pre-existing files, or WITH MOVE to identify an alternate location. |
| 3143 | 16 | No | The data set on device '%ls' is not a SQL Server backup set. |
| 3144 | 16 | No | File '%.\*ls' was not backed up in file %d on device '%ls'. The file cannot be restored from this backup set. |
| 3145 | 16 | No | The STOPAT option is not supported for databases that use the SIMPLE recovery model. |
| 3147 | 16 | No | Backup and restore operations are not allowed on database tempdb. |
| 3148 | 16 | No | This RESTORE statement is invalid in the current context. The 'Recover Data Only' option is only defined for secondary filegroups when the database is in an online state. When the database is in an offline state filegroups cannot be specified. |
| 3149 | 16 | No | The file or filegroup "%ls" is not in a valid state for the "Recover Data Only" option to be used. Only secondary files in the OFFLINE or RECOVERY_PENDING state can be processed. |
| 3150 | 10 | No | The master database has been successfully restored. Shutting down SQL Server. |
| [3151](../mssqlserver-3151-database-engine-error.md) | 21 | Yes | Failed to restore master database. Shutting down SQL Server. Check the error logs, and rebuild the master database. For more information about how to rebuild the master database, see SQL Server Books Online. |
| 3153 | 16 | No | The database is already fully recovered. |
| 3154 | 16 | No | The backup set holds a backup of a database other than the existing '%ls' database. |
| 3155 | 16 | No | The RESTORE operation cannot proceed because one or more files have been added or dropped from the database since the backup set was created. |
| [3156](../mssqlserver-3156-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | File '%ls' cannot be restored to '%ls'. Use WITH MOVE to identify a valid location for the file. |
| [3159](../mssqlserver-3159-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | The tail of the log for the database "%ls" has not been backed up. Use BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY to backup the log if it contains work you do not want to lose. Use the WITH REPLACE or WITH STOPAT clause of the RESTORE statement to just overwrite the contents of the log. |
| 3161 | 16 | No | The primary file is unavailable. It must be restored or otherwise made available. |
| 3163 | 16 | No | The transaction log was damaged. All data files must be restored before RESTORE LOG can be attempted. |
| 3165 | 16 | No | Database '%ls' was restored, however an error was encountered while replication was being restored/removed. The database has been left offline. See the topic MSSQL_ENG003165 in SQL Server Books Online. |
| 3166 | 16 | No | RESTORE DATABASE could not drop database '%ls'. Drop the database and then reissue the RESTORE DATABASE statement. |
| 3167 | 16 | No | RESTORE could not start database '%ls'. |
| [3168](../mssqlserver-3168-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | The backup of the system database on the device %ls cannot be restored because it was created by a different version of the server (%ls) than this server (%ls). |
| [3169](../mssqlserver-3169-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | The database was backed up on a server running version %ls. That version is incompatible with this server, which is running version %ls. Either restore the database on a server that supports the backup, or use a backup that is compatible with this server. |
| 3170 | 16 | No | The STANDBY filename is invalid. |
| 3171 | 16 | No | File %ls is defunct and cannot be restored into the online database. |
| 3172 | 16 | No | Filegroup %ls is defunct and cannot be restored into the online database. |
| 3173 | 16 | No | The STOPAT clause provided with this RESTORE statement indicates that the tail of the log contains changes that must be backed up to reach the target point in time. The tail of the log for the database "%ls" has not been backed up. Use BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY to back up the log, or use the WITH REPLACE clause in your RESTORE statement to overwrite the tail of the log. |
| 3174 | 16 | No | The file '%ls' cannot be moved by this RESTORE operation. |
| 3175 | 10 | No | RESTORE FILEGROUP="%ls" was specified, but not all of its files are present in the backup set. File "%ls" is missing. RESTORE will continue, but if you want all files to be restored, you must restore other backup sets. |
| [3176](../mssqlserver-3176-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | File '%ls' is claimed by '%ls'(%d) and '%ls'(%d). The WITH MOVE clause can be used to relocate one or more files. |
| 3178 | 16 | No | File %ls is not in the correct state to have this differential backup applied to it. |
| 3179 | 16 | No | The system database cannot be moved by RESTORE. |
| 3180 | 16 | No | This backup cannot be restored using WITH STANDBY because a database upgrade is needed. Reissue the RESTORE without WITH STANDBY. |
| [3181](../mssqlserver-3181-database-engine-error.md) | 10 | No | Attempting to restore this backup may encounter storage space problems. Subsequent messages will provide details. |
| 3182 | 16 | No | The backup set cannot be restored because the database was damaged when the backup occurred. Salvage attempts may exploit WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR. |
| [3183](../mssqlserver-3183-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | RESTORE detected an error on page (%d:%d) in database "%ls" as read from the backup set. |
| 3184 | 10 | No | RESTORE WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR was successful but some damage was encountered. Inconsistencies in the database are possible. |
| 3185 | 16 | No | RESTORE cannot apply this backup set because the database is suspect. Restore a backup set that repairs the damage. |
| 3186 | 16 | No | The backup set has been damaged. RESTORE will not attempt to apply this backup set. |
| 3187 | 16 | No | RESTORE WITH CHECKSUM cannot be specified because the backup set does not contain checksum information. |
| 3188 | 10 | No | The backup set was written with damaged data by a BACKUP WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR. |
| 3189 | 16 | No | Damage to the backup set was detected. |
| 3190 | 16 | No | Filegroup '%ls' cannot be restored because it does not exist in the backup set. |
| 3191 | 16 | No | Restore cannot continue because file '%ls' cannot be written. Ensure that all files in the database are writable. |
| 3192 | 10 | No | Restore was successful but deferred transactions remain. These transactions cannot be resolved because there are data that is unavailable. Either use RESTORE to make that data available or drop the filegroups if you never need this data again. Dropping the filegroup results in a defunct filegroup. |
| 3193 | 16 | No | Restore Log operations are not permitted for a Log Backup with FILE_SNAPSHOT if bulk operations were present during the backup period. The Restore can be accomplished by issuing Restore Database from this archive. |
| 3194 | 16 | No | Page %S_PGID is beyond the end of the file. Only pages that are in the current range of the file can be restored. |
| 3195 | 16 | No | Page %S_PGID cannot be restored from this backup set. RESTORE PAGE can only be used from full backup sets or from the first log or differential backup taken since the file was added to the database. |
| 3196 | 16 | No | RESTORE master WITH SNAPSHOT is not supported. To restore master from a snapshot backup, stop the service and copy the data and log file. |
| 3197 | 10 | Yes | I/O is frozen on database %ls. No user action is required. However, if I/O is not resumed promptly, you could cancel the backup. |
| 3198 | 10 | Yes | I/O was resumed on database %ls. No user action is required. |
| 3199 | 16 | No | RESTORE requires MAXTRANSFERSIZE=%u but %u was specified. |
| [3201](../mssqlserver-3201-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | Cannot open backup device '%ls'. Operating system error %ls. |
| 3202 | 16 | No | Write on "%ls" failed: %ls |
| 3203 | 16 | No | Read on "%ls" failed: %ls |
| 3204 | 16 | No | The backup or restore was aborted. |
| 3205 | 16 | No | Too many backup devices specified for backup or restore; only %d are allowed. |
| 3206 | 16 | No | Backup device '%.\*ls' does not exist. To view existing backup devices, use the sys.backup_devices catalog view. To create a new backup device use either sp_addumpdevice or SQL Server Management Studio. |
| 3207 | 16 | No | Backup or restore requires at least one backup device. Rerun your statement specifying a backup device. |
| 3208 | 16 | No | Unexpected end of file while reading beginning of backup set. Confirm that the media contains a valid SQL Server backup set, and see the console error log for more details. |
| 3209 | 16 | No | Operation is not supported on user instances. |
| 3210 | 16 | No | The mirror member in drive "%ls" is inconsistent with the mirror member in drive "%ls". |
| 3211 | 10 | No | %d percent processed. |
| 3212 | 16 | No | The mirror device "%ls" and the mirror device "%ls" have different device specifications. |

| 3927 | 10 | No | The session had an active transaction when it tried to enlist in a Distributed Transaction Coordinator transaction. |
| 3928 | 16 | No | The marked transaction "%.\*ls" failed. A timeout occurred while attempting to place a mark in the log by committing the marked transaction. This can be caused by contention with Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) transactions or other local marked transaction that have prepared, but not committed or aborted. Try the operation again and if the error persists, determine the source of the contention. |
| 3929 | 16 | No | No distributed or bound transaction is allowed in single user database. |
| 3930 | 16 | No | The current transaction cannot be committed and cannot support operations that write to the log file. Roll back the transaction. |
| 3931 | 16 | No | The current transaction cannot be committed and cannot be rolled back to a savepoint. Roll back the entire transaction. |
| 3932 | 16 | No | The save point name "%.\*ls" that was provided is too long. The maximum allowed length is %d characters. |
| 3933 | 16 | No | Cannot promote the transaction to a distributed transaction because there is an active save point in this transaction. |
| 3934 | 14 | No | The current user cannot use this FILESTREAM transaction context. To obtain a valid FILESTREAM transaction context, use GET_FILESTREAM_TRANSACTION_CONTEXT. |
| 3935 | 16 | No | A FILESTREAM transaction context could not be initialized. This might be caused by a resource shortage. Retry the operation. Error code: 0x%x. |
| 3936 | 16 | No | The transaction could not be committed because an error occurred while tyring to flush FILESTREAM data to disk. A file may have been open at commit time or a disk I/O error may have occurred. '%.\*ls' was one of the one or more files involved. ErorrCode: 0x%x |
| [3937](../mssqlserver-3937-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | While rolling back a transaction, an error occurred while trying to deliver a rollback notification to the FILESTREAM filter driver. Error code: 0x%0x. |
| 3938 | 18 | No | The transaction has been stopped because it conflicted with the execution of a FILESTREAM close operation using the same transaction. The transaction will be rolled back. |
| 3939 | 16 | No | An uncommittable transaction was detected at the beginning of the batch. The transaction was rolled back. This was caused by an error that occurred during the processing of a FILESTREAM request in the context of this transaction. |
| 3940 | 16 | No | Failed to acquire necessary locks during commit and the transaction was rolled back. |
| 3948 | 16 | No | The transaction was terminated because of the availability replica config/state change or because ghost records are being deleted on the primary and the secondary availability replica that might be needed by queries running under snapshot isolation. Retry the transaction. |
| 3949 | 16 | No | Transaction aborted when accessing versioned row in table '%.\*ls' in database '%.\*ls'. Requested versioned row was not found because the readable secondary access is not allowed for the operation that attempted to create the version. This might be timing related, so try the query again later. |
| 3950 | 16 | No | Version store scan timed out when attempting to read the next row. Please try the statement again later when the system is not as busy. |
| 3951 | 16 | No | Transaction failed in database '%.\*ls' because the statement was run under snapshot isolation but the transaction did not start in snapshot isolation. You cannot change the isolation level of the transaction to snapshot after the transaction has started unless the transaction was originally started under snapshot isolation level. |
| 3952 | 16 | No | Snapshot isolation transaction failed accessing database '%.\*ls' because snapshot isolation is not allowed in this database. Use ALTER DATABASE to allow snapshot isolation. |
| 3953 | 16 | No | Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.\*ls' because the database was not recovered when the current transaction was started. Retry the transaction after the database has recovered. |
| 3954 | 16 | No | Snapshot isolation transaction failed to start in database '%.\*ls' because the ALTER DATABASE command that disallows snapshot isolation had started before this transaction began. The database is in transition to OFF state. You will either need to change the isolation level of the transaction or re-enable the snapshot isolation in the database. |
| 3955 | 16 | No | Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.\*ls' because the recovery was skipped for this database. You must recover the database before you can run a transaction under snapshot isolation. |
| 3956 | 16 | No | Snapshot isolation transaction failed to start in database '%.\*ls' because the ALTER DATABASE command which enables snapshot isolation for this database has not finished yet. The database is in transition to pending ON state. You must wait until the ALTER DATABASE Command completes successfully. |
| 3957 | 16 | No | Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.\*ls' because the database did not allow snapshot isolation when the current transaction started. It may help to retry the transaction. |
| 3958 | 16 | No | Transaction aborted when accessing versioned row in table '%.\*ls' in database '%.\*ls'. Requested versioned row was not found. Your tempdb is probably out of space. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning. |
| 3959 | 10 | Yes | Version store is full. New version(s) could not be added. A transaction that needs to access the version store may be rolled back. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning. |
| 3960 | 16 | No | Snapshot isolation transaction aborted due to update conflict. You cannot use snapshot isolation to access table '%.\*ls' directly or indirectly in database '%.\*ls' to update, delete, or insert the row that has been modified or deleted by another transaction. Retry the transaction or change the isolation level for the update/delete statement. |
| [3961](../mssqlserver-3961-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.\*ls' because the object accessed by the statement has been modified by a DDL statement in another concurrent transaction since the start of this transaction. It is disallowed because the metadata is not versioned. A concurrent update to metadata can lead to inconsistency if mixed with snapshot isolation. |
| 3962 | 16 | No | Bind to another transaction while executing SQL Server internal query is not supported. Check your logon trigger definition and remove any sp_bindsession usage if any. If this error is not happening during logon trigger execution, contact production support team. |
| 3963 | 16 | No | Transaction failed in database '%.\*ls' because distributed transactions are not supported under snapshot isolation. |
| 3964 | 16 | No | Transaction failed because this DDL statement is not allowed inside a snapshot isolation transaction. Since metadata is not versioned, a metadata change can lead to inconsistency if mixed within snapshot isolation. |
| 3965 | 16 | No | The PROMOTE TRANSACTION request failed because there is no local transaction active. |
| 3966 | 17 | No | Transaction is rolled back when accessing version store. It was earlier marked as victim when the version store was shrunk due to insufficient space in tempdb. This transaction was marked as a victim earlier because it may need the row version(s) that have already been removed to make space in tempdb. Retry the transaction |
| 3967 | 17 | Yes | Insufficient space in tempdb to hold row versions. Need to shrink the version store to free up some space in tempdb. Transaction (id=%I64d xsn=%I64d spid=%d elapsed_time=%d) has been marked as victim and it will be rolled back if it accesses the version store. If the problem persists, the likely cause is improperly sized tempdb or long running transactions. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning. |
| 3968 | 10 | No | Snapshot isolation or read committed snapshot is not available in database '%.\*ls' because SQL Server was started with one or more undocumented trace flags that prevent enabling database for versioning. Transaction started with snapshot isolation will fail and a query running under read committed snapshot will succeed but will resort back to lock based read committed. |
| 3969 | 16 | No | Distributed transaction is not supported while running SQL Server internal query. Check your logon trigger definition and remove any distributed transaction usage if any. If this error is not happening during logon trigger execution, contact production support team. |
| 3970 | 16 | No | This operation conflicts with another pending operation on this transaction. The operation failed. |
| 3971 | 16 | No | The server failed to resume the transaction. Desc:%I64x. |
| 3972 | 20 | Yes | Incoming Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol is incorrect. Transaction Manager event has wrong length. Event type: %d. Expected length: %d. Actual length: %d. |
| 3973 | 16 | No | The database is currently being used by another thread under the same workspace in exclusive mode. The operation failed. |
| 3974 | 16 | No | The number of databases in exclusive mode usage under a workspace is limited. Because the limit has been exceeded, the operation failed. |
| 3975 | 16 | No | The varchar(max) data type is not supported for sp_getbindtoken. The batch has been aborted. |
| 3976 | 16 | No | The transaction name has the odd length %d. The batch has been aborted. |
| 3977 | 16 | No | The savepoint name cannot be NULL. The batch has been aborted. |
| 3978 | 16 | No | Beginning a new transaction after rollback to save point is not allowed. |
| 3979 | 16 | No | The TM request is longer than expected. The request is not processed. |
| 3980 | 16 | No | The request failed to run because the batch is aborted, this can be caused by abort signal sent from client, or another request is running in the same session, which makes the session busy. |
| 3981 | 16 | No | The transaction operation cannot be performed because there are pending requests working on this transaction. |
| 3982 | 16 | No | New transaction is not allowed to be started while DTC or bound transaction is active. |
| 3983 | 16 | No | The operation failed because the session is not single threaded. |
| 3984 | 16 | No | Cannot acquire a database lock during a transaction change. |
| 3985 | 16 | No | An error occurred during the changing of transaction context. This is usually caused by low memory in the system. Try to free up more memory. |
| 3986 | 19 | No | The transaction timestamps ran out. Restart the server. |
| 3987 | 10 | No | SNAPSHOT ISOLATION is always enabled in this database. |
| [3988](../mssqlserver-3988-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | New transaction is not allowed because there are other threads running in the session. |
| [3989](../mssqlserver-3989-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | New request is not allowed to start because it should come with valid transaction descriptor. |
| 3990 | 16 | No | Transaction is not allowed to commit inside of a user defined routine, trigger or aggregate because the transaction is not started in that CLR level. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting. |
| 3991 | 16 | No | The context transaction which was active before entering user defined routine, trigger or aggregate "%.\*ls" has been ended inside of it, which is not allowed. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting. |
| 3992 | 16 | No | Transaction count has been changed from %d to %d inside of user defined routine, trigger or aggregate "%.\*ls". This is not allowed and user transaction will be rolled back. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting. |
| 3993 | 16 | No | The user transaction that has been started in user defined routine, trigger or aggregate "%.\*ls" is not ended upon exiting from it. This is not allowed and the transaction will be rolled back. Change application logic to enforce strict transaction nesting. |
| 3994 | 16 | No | User defined routine, trigger or aggregate tried to rollback a transaction that is not started in that CLR level. An exception will be thrown to prevent execution of rest of the user defined routine, trigger or aggregate. |
| 3995 | 16 | No | Unknown transaction isolation level %d, valid value range is 0 to 5. |
| 3996 | 16 | No | Snapshot isolation level is not supported for distributed transaction. Use another isolation level or do not use distributed transaction. |
| 3997 | 16 | No | A transaction that was started in a MARS batch is still active at the end of the batch. The transaction is rolled back. |
| 3998 | 16 | No | Uncommittable transaction is detected at the end of the batch. The transaction is rolled back. |
| 3999 | 17 | Yes | Failed to flush the commit table to disk in dbid %d due to error %d. Check the errorlog for more information. |
