| 33434 | 16 | No | The current state of the database '%.\*s' is not compatible with the specified FILESTREAM non-transacted access level. The database may be read only, single user or set to emergency state. |
| 33435 | 16 | No | Cannot publish the FileTable '%ls' for replication. Replication is not supported for FileTable objects. |
| 33436 | 16 | No | Cannot enable Change Data Capture on the FileTable '%ls'. Change Data Capture is not supported for FileTable objects. |
| 33437 | 16 | No | Cannot publish the logbased view '%ls' for replication. Replication is not supported for logbased views that depend on FileTable objects. |
| 33438 | 16 | No | Cannot enable Change Tracking on the FileTable '%.\*ls'. Change Tracking is not supported for FileTable objects. |
| 33439 | 16 | No | Cannot use IGNORE_CONSTRAINTS hint when inserting into FileTable '%.\*ls', unless FILETABLE_NAMESPACE is disabled. |
| 33440 | 16 | No | When inserting into FileTable '%.\*ls' using BCP or BULK INSERT, either CHECK_CONSTRAINTS option needs to be on, or FILETABLE_NAMESPACE needs to be disabled on the table. |
| 33441 | 16 | No | The FileTable '%.\*s' cannot be partitioned. Partitioning is not supported on FileTable objects. |
| 33442 | 16 | No | The handle ID %d is opened against the server root share and cannot be killed. The lifetime of the handle is controlled by the client who originally opened it. |
| 33443 | 16 | No | The database '%.\*s' cannot be enabled for both FILESTREAM non-transacted access and Database Mirroring. |
| 33444 | 16 | No | The database '%.\*s' cannot be enabled for both FILESTREAM non-transacted access and HADR. |
| 33445 | 16 | No | The database '%.\*s' is a readable secondary database in an availability group and cannot be enabled for FILESTREAM non-transacted access. |
| 33446 | 16 | No | The FILESTREAM database configuration cannot be changed for database '%.\*s'. The database is either a mirror database in Database Mirroring, or is in a secondary replica of an Always On availability group. Connect to the server instance that hosts the primary database replica, and retry the operation. |
| 33447 | 16 | No | Cannot access file_stream column in FileTable '%.\*ls', because FileTable doesn't support row versioning. Either set transaction level to something other than READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT or SNAPSHOT, or use READCOMMITTEDLOCK table hint. |
| 33448 | 16 | No | Cannot disable clustered index '%.\*ls' on FileTable '%.\*ls' because the FILETABLE_NAMESPACE is enabled. |
| 33449 | 10 | No | FILESTREAM File I/O access is enabled, but no listener for the availability group is created. A FILESTREAM PathName will be unable to refer to a virtual network name (VNN) and, instead, will need to refer to a physical Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) node. This might limit the usability of FILESTEAM File I/0 access after an availability group failover. Therefore, we recommend that you create a listener for each availability group. For information about how to create an availability group listener, see SQL Server Books Online. |
| 33450 | 10 | No | FILESTREAM File I/O access is enabled. One or more availability groups ('%ls') currently do not have a listener. A FILESTREAM PathName will be unable to refer to a virtual network name (VNN) and, instead, will need to refer to a physical Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) node. This might limit the usability of FILESTEAM File I/0 access after an availability group failover. Therefore, we recommend that you create a listener for each availability group. For information about how to create an availability group listener, see SQL Server Books Online. |
| 33501 | 16 | No | Security predicates cannot be added on tables that contain filestream data. Column '%.\*ls' on table '%.\*ls' contains filestream data. |
| 33502 | 16 | No | The column '%.\*ls' could not be added to table '%.\*ls' because the column contains filestream data and the table is referenced by one or more security policies. Filestream columns are not allowed on tables that are referenced by security policies. |
| 33503 | 16 | No | BLOCK predicates can only be added to user tables. '%.\*ls' is not a user table. |
| 33504 | 16 | No | The attempted operation failed because the target object '%.\*ls' has a block predicate that conflicts with this operation. If the operation is performed on a view, the block predicate might be enforced on the underlying table. Modify the operation to target only the rows that are allowed by the block predicate. |
| 33505 | 16 | No | Partitioned view '%.\*ls' is not updatable because table '%.\*ls' has an enabled security policy that defines block predicates for this table. |
| 33506 | 16 | No | Only natively compiled inline table-valued functions can be used for security predicates on memory optimized tables. Table '%.\*ls' is memory optimized, but function '%.\*ls' is not natively compiled. Recreate the function using WITH NATIVE_COMPILATION. |
| 33507 | 16 | No | Function '%ls' cannot be used in the definition of BLOCK security predicates. Modify the BLOCK security predicates for this table or view to not use this function. |
| 33508 | 16 | No | Column '%.\*ls' cannot be passed as a parameter for a BLOCK security predicate because the column definition contains an expression using a window function. Modify the BLOCK security predicates for this view to not use this column. |
| 33509 | 16 | No | Column '%.\*ls' cannot be passed as a parameter for an AFTER UPDATE or AFTER INSERT BLOCK security predicate for this view because it refers to a base table that is not being modified in this statement. Modify the AFTER INSERT and AFTER UPDATE BLOCK security predicates for this view to not use this column. |
| 33510 | 16 | No | BLOCK security predicates cannot reference temporal history tables. Table '%.\*ls' is a temporal history table. |
| 33511 | 16 | No | Table '%.\*ls' is memory optimized. Only security policies with schema binding enabled may specify security predicates for memory optimized tables. Create a new security policy with schema binding enabled. |
| 33512 | 16 | No | Binding for the non-schema bound security predicate on object '%.\*ls' failed with one or more errors, indicating the schema of the predicate function has changed. Update or drop the affected security predicates. |
| 33513 | 16 | No | Binding for the non-schema bound security predicate on object '%.\*ls' failed, because the predicate function is not an inline table-valued function. Only inline table-valued functions can be used for security predicates. |
| 33514 | 16 | No | Incorrect parameter encryption metadata was received from the client. The error occurred during the invocation of the batch and therefore the client can refresh the parameter encryption metadata by calling sp_describe_parameter_encryption and retry. |
| 33515 | 16 | No | The parameter "%.\*ls" does not have the same encryption information as the one it was created with. Use sp_refresh_parameter_encryption to refresh the parameter encryption information for the module. |
| 33516 | 16 | No | The object '%.\*ls' is referenced by the security policy '%.\*ls'. The currently installed edition of SQL Server does not support security policies. Either drop the security policy or upgrade the instance of SQL Server to a version that supports security policies. |
| 33517 | 16 | No | The column '%.\*ls' of the object '%.\*ls' is encrypted. The currently installed edition of SQL Server does not support encrypted columns. Either remove the encryption from the column or upgrade the instance of SQL Server to a version that supports encrypted columns. |

| 35201 | 10 | No | A connection timeout has occurred while attempting to establish a connection to availability replica '%ls' with id \[%ls\]. Either a networking or firewall issue exists, or the endpoint address provided for the replica is not the database mirroring endpoint of the host server instance. |
| 35202 | 10 | No | A connection for availability group '%ls' from availability replica '%ls' with id \[%ls\] to '%ls' with id \[%ls\] has been successfully established. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 35203 | 16 | No | Unable to establish a connection between instance '%ls' with id \[%ls\] and '%ls' with id \[%ls\] due to a transport version mismatch. |
| 35204 | 10 | No | The connection between server instances '%ls' with id \[%ls\] and '%ls' with id \[%ls\] has been disabled because the database mirroring endpoint was either disabled or stopped. Restart the endpoint by using the ALTER ENDPOINT Transact-SQL statement with STATE = STARTED. |
| 35205 | 16 | No | Could not start the Always On Availability Groups transport manager. This failure probably occurred because a low memory condition existed when the message dispatcher started up. If so, other internal tasks might also have experienced errors. Check the SQL Server error log and the Windows error log for additional error messages. If a low memory condition exists, investigate and correct its cause. |
| 35206 | 10 | No | A connection timeout has occurred on a previously established connection to availability replica '%ls' with id \[%ls\]. Either a networking or a firewall issue exists or the availability replica has transitioned to the resolving role. |
| 35207 | 16 | No | Connection attempt on availability group id '%ls' from replica id '%ls' to replica id '%ls' failed because of error %d, severity %d, state %d. |
| 35208 | 16 | No | Availability-group DDL operations are permitted only when you are using the master database. Run the USE MASTER command, and retry your availability-group DDL command. |
| 35209 | 16 | No | The %ls operation failed for availability replica '%.\*ls', because the backup priority value is outside the valid range. The valid range is between %d and %d, inclusive. Set the backup priority to a value within this range, and retry the operation. |
| 35210 | 16 | No | Failed to modify options for availability replica '%.\*ls' in availability group '%.\*ls'. The specified availability group does not contain an availability replica with specified name. Verify that availability group name and availability replica name are correct, then retry the operation. |
| 35211 | 16 | No | The %ls operation is not allowed. The operation attempted to change the configuration of availability replica '%.\*ls' to the asynchronous-commit availability mode with automatic failover, which is an invalid configuration. Either change the failover mode to manual or the availability mode to synchronous commit, and retry the operation. |
| 35212 | 16 | No | The %ls operation is not allowed by the current availability-group configuration. This operation would exceed the maximum number of %d synchronous-commit availability replicas in availability group '%.\*ls'. Change one of the existing synchronous-commit replicas to the asynchronous-commit availability mode, and retry the operation. |
| 35213 | 16 | No | The %ls operation is not allowed by the current availability-group configuration. This operation would exceed the maximum number of %d automatic failover targets in availability group '%.\*ls'. Change one of the existing synchronous-commit replicas to the manual failover mode, and retry the operation. |
| 35214 | 16 | No | The %ls operation failed for availability replica '%.\*ls'. The minimum value for session timeout is %d. Retry the operation specifying a valid session-timeout value. |
| 35215 | 16 | No | The %ls operation is not allowed on availability replica '%.\*ls', because automatic failover mode is an invalid configuration on a SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance. Retry the operation by specifying manual failover mode. |
| 35216 | 16 | No | An error occurred while adding or removing a log truncation holdup to build secondary replica from primary availability database '%.\*ls'. Primary database is temporarily offline due to restart or other transient condition. Retry the operation. |
| 35217 | 16 | No | The thread pool for Always On Availability Groups was unable to start a new worker thread because there are not enough available worker threads. This may degrade Always On Availability Groups performance. Use the "max worker threads" configuration option to increase number of allowable threads. |
| 35218 | 16 | No | An error occurred while trying to set the initial Backup LSN of database '%.\*ls'. Primary database is temporarily offline due to restart or other transient condition. Retry the operation. |
| 35220 | 16 | No | Could not process the operation. Always On Availability Groups replica manager is waiting for the host computer to start a Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster and join it. Either the local computer is not a cluster node, or the local cluster node is not online. If the computer is a cluster node, wait for it to join the cluster. If the computer is not a cluster node, add the computer to a WSFC cluster. Then, retry the operation. |
| 35221 | 16 | No | Could not process the operation. Always On Availability Groups replica manager is disabled on this instance of SQL Server.

| 35223 | 16 | No | Cannot add %d availability replica(s) to availability group '%.\*ls'. The availability group already contains %d replica(s), and the maximum number of replicas supported in an availability group is %d. |
| 35224 | 16 | No | Could not process the operation. Always On Availability Groups failed to load the required Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) library. Verify that the computer is a node in a WSFC cluster. You will need to restart the SQL Server instance to reload the required library functions. |
| 35225 | 16 | No | Could not process the operation. The instance of SQL Server is running under WOW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit), which does not support Always On Availability Groups. Reinstall SQL Server in the native 64-bit edition, and re-enable Always On Availability Groups. Then, restart the SQL Server service, and retry the operation. For information about how to enable and disable Always On Availability Groups, see SQL Server Books Online. |
| 35226 | 16 | No | Could not process the operation. Always On Availability Groups has not started because the instance of SQL Server is not running as a service. Restart the server instance as a service, and retry the operation. |
| 35228 | 16 | No | The attempt to set the failure condition level for availability group '%.\*ls' failed. The specified level value is out of the valid range \[%u, %u\]. Reenter the command specifying a valid failure condition level value. |

| 35233 | 16 | No | Cannot create an availability group containing %d availability replica(s).	The maximum number of availability replicas in an availability group %ls is %d. Reenter your CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP command specifying fewer availability replicas. |
| 35234 | 16 | No | Database name '%ls' was specified more than once. Reenter the command, specifying each database name only once. |
| 35235 | 16 | No | The system name '%ls' was specified more than once in the REPLICA ON clause of this command. Reenter the command, specifying a different instance of SQL Server for each replica. |
| 35236 | 15 | No | The endpoint URL was not specified for the availability replica hosted by server instance '%.\*ls'. Reenter the command, specifying the endpoint URL of this instance of SQL Server. |
| 35237 | 16 | No | None of the specified replicas for availability group %.\*ls maps to the instance of SQL Server to which you are connected. Reenter the command, specifying this server instance to host one of the replicas. This replica will be the initial primary replica. |
| 35238 | 16 | No | Database '%.\*ls' cannot be added to availability group '%.\*ls'. The database does not exist on this SQL Server instance. Verify that the database name is correct, then retry the operation. |
| 35239 | 16 | No | The ALTER DATABASE \<database-name\> SET HADR SUSPEND (or SET HADR RESUME) statement failed on database '%.\*ls' of availability group '%.\*ls''. Either the availability group does not contain the specified database, or the database has not joined the availability group, or the database has not yet started. Reenter the command after the database is online and has joined the availability group. |
| 35240 | 16 | No | Database '%.\*ls' cannot be joined to or unjoined from availability group '%.\*ls'. This operation is not supported on the primary replica of the availability group. |
| 35242 | 16 | No | Cannot complete this ALTER DATABASE \<database-name\> SET HADR operation on database '%.\*ls'. The database is not joined to an availability group. After the database has joined the availability group, retry the command. |
| 35243 | 16 | No | Failed to set resource property '%.\*ls' for availability group '%.\*ls'. The operation encountered SQL Server error %d. When the cause of the error has been resolved, retry the ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP command later. |
| 35244 | 16 | No | Database '%.\*ls' cannot be added to availability group '%.\*ls'. The database is currently joined to another availability group. Verify that the database name is correct and that the database is not joined to an availability group, then retry the operation. |
| 35246 | 16 | No | Failed to create the availability group. A SQL Server instance name could not be validated because the dynamic link library (DLL) file '%ls' could not be located (Windows System Error %d). Verify that the specified server instance exists. If it exists, the DLL file might be missing from the server instance. |
| 35247 | 16 | No | Failed to create the availability group. A SQL Server instance name could not be validated because the dynamic link library (DLL) file '%ls' could not be loaded (Windows System Error %d). |
| 35249 | 16 | No | An attempt to add or join a system database, '%.\*ls', to an availability group failed. Specify only user databases for this operation. |
| [35250](../mssqlserver-35250-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | The connection to the primary replica is not active. The command cannot be processed. |
| 35251 | 16 | No | This command can be run only on the primary replica. Connect to the primary replica, and retry the command. |

| 35253 | 16 | No | Database "%.\*ls" is not in the correct state to become the primary database. The log must be restored from the previous primary replica to bring the database out of the reinitializing state. |
| 35254 | 16 | Yes | An error occurred while accessing the availability group metadata. Remove this database or replica from the availability group, and reconfigure the availability group to add the database or replica again. For more information, see the ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP Transact-SQL statement in SQL Server Books Online. |
| 35255 | 16 | No | An attempt to start database '%.\*ls' failed because the database is already started and online. |
| 35256 | 16 | No | The session timeout value was exceeded while waiting for a response from the other availability replica in the session. That replica or the network might be down, or the command might be misconfigured. If the partner is running and visible over the network, retry the command using correctly configured partner-connection parameters. |
| 35257 | 16 | No | Always On Availability Groups Send Error (Error code 0x%X, "NOT OK") was returned when sending a message for database ID %d. If the partner is running and visible over the network, retry the command using correctly configured partner-connection parameters. |

| 35259 | 16 | No | Database '%.\*ls' is already participating in a different availability group. |
| 35260 | 16 | No | During an attempted database recovery, an availability database manager was not found for database id %d with availability group ID %d and group database ID %ls. Recovery was terminated. The most likely cause of this error is that the availability group manager is not running, but the cause could be a metadata error. Ensure that the availability group manager and the WSFC cluster are started, and retry the recovery operation. |
| 35261 | 16 | No | Attempt to perform an Always On Availability Groups operation on a system database, '%ls', failed. System databases are not supported by Always On Availability Groups. |
| 35262 | 17 | Yes | Skipping the default startup of database '%.\*ls' because the database belongs to an availability group (Group ID: %d). The database will be started by the availability group. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 35263 | 16 | No | During the undo phase, a function call (%ls) to the primary replica returned an unexpected status (Code: %d). Check for a possible cause in the SQL Server error log for the primary replica. If an error occurred on the primary database, you might need to suspend the secondary database, fix the issue on the primary database, and then resume the database. |
| 35264 | 10 | No | Always On Availability Groups data movement for database '%.\*ls' has been suspended for the following reason: "%S_MSG" (Source ID %d; Source string: '%.\*ls'). To resume data movement on the database, you will need to resume the database manually. For information about how to resume an availability database, see SQL Server Books Online. |
