| 6336 | 16 | No | Maximum size of primary index of table '%.\*ls' is %d bytes. CREATE XML INDEX requires that such size should be limited to %d bytes |
| 6337 | 16 | No | '%.\*ls' is not a valid XML Index name because it starts with '%c' character. XML Index name should not start with '#' or '@' |
| 6338 | 10 | No | XML DTD has been stripped from one or more XML fragments. External subsets, if any, have been ignored. |
| 6339 | 16 | No | Specified collection '%.\*ls' cannot be modified because it is SQL Server built-in XML Schema Collection. |

| 6829 | 16 | No | FOR XML EXPLICIT and RAW modes currently do not support addressing binary data as URLs in column '%.\*ls'. Remove the column, or use the BINARY BASE64 mode, or create the URL directly using the 'dbobject/TABLE\[@PK1="V1"\]/@COLUMN' syntax. |
| 6830 | 16 | No | FOR XML AUTO could not find the table owning the following column '%.\*ls' to create a URL address for it. Remove the column, or use the BINARY BASE64 mode, or create the URL directly using the 'dbobject/TABLE\[@PK1="V1"\]/@COLUMN' syntax. |

| 6832 | 16 | No | FOR XML AUTO cannot generate a URL address for binary data if a primary key is also binary. |
| 6833 | 16 | No | Parent tag ID %d is not among the open tags. FOR XML EXPLICIT requires parent tags to be opened first. Check the ordering of the result set. |

| 6968 | 16 | No | Invalid type definition for type '%s'. Complex types cannot restrict simple types |
| 6969 | 16 | No | ID/IDREF validation consumed too much memory. Try reducing the number of ID and IDREF attributes. Rearranging the file so that elements with IDREF attributes appear after the elements which they reference may also be helpful. |

| 6989 | 16 | No | Invalid restriction for type '%s'. A 'sequence' particle may be restricted only by 'element' or 'sequence'. |
| 6990 | 16 | No | Invalid restriction for type '%s'. Invalid model group restriction. |
| 6991 | 16 | No | Invalid restriction for type '%s'. If the base type has empty content, then the derived type must as well, and if the derived type has empty content, then the base type must be emptiable. |
