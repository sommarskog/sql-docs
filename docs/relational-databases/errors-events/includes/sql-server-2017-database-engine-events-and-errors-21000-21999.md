| 21522 | 16 | No | This article cannot use the '%s' feature because the publication compatibility level is less than 90. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the publication_compatibility_level of publication '%s' to '90RTM'. |
| 21523 | 16 | No | Adding column '%s' to table '%s' failed. Articles can have at most %d columns, including columns that have been filtered. |
| 21525 | 16 | No | A lightweight replica must be anonymous. |
| 21526 | 16 | No | Article '%s' already belongs to a subscription with a different value for the @lightweight property. |
| 21527 | 16 | No | Publication '%s' cannot be added to database '%s', because a publication with a lower compatibility level already exists. All merge publications in a database must have the same compatibility level. |
| 21528 | 16 | No | Publication '%s' cannot be added to database '%s', because a publication with a higher compatibility level already exists. All merge publications in a database must have the same compatibiliy level. |
| 21530 | 10 | No | The schema change failed during execution of an internal replication procedure. For corrective action, see the other error messages that accompany this error message. |
| 21531 | 10 | No | The data definition language (DDL) command cannot be executed at the Subscriber. DDL commands can only be executed at the Publisher. In a republishing hierarchy, DDL commands can only be executed at the root Publisher, not at any of the republishing Subscribers. |
| 21532 | 10 | No | Cannot add a data definition language trigger for replicating '%.\*ls' events. |
| 21533 | 10 | No | Cannot insert information into the schema change tracking table sysmergeschemachange. |
| 21535 | 16 | No | The article '%s' is already published in another publication, and is set to use nonoverlapping partitions with multiple subscribers per partition (@partition_options = 2). This setting does not permit the article to be included in more than one publication. |
| 21537 | 16 | No | The column '%s' in table '%s' is involved in a foreign key relationship with a column in table '%s', but this column was not found in the specified join clause. A logical record relationship between these tables should include this column. |
| 21538 | 16 | No | Table '%s' cannot have table '%s' as a parent in a logical record relationship because it already has a different parent table. A logical record relationship allows only one parent table for a given child table. |
| 21539 | 16 | No | A logical record relationship, specified by the @filter_type parameter, requires a one-to-one or a one-to-many join from the parent table to the child table. Either change the value of the @filter_type parameter, or set the @join_unique_key parameter to 1. |
| 21540 | 16 | No | You cannot drop a column defined as data type uniqueidentifier with the rowguidcol property because merge replication uses this column for tracking. To drop the column, you must first drop the table from all publications and subscriptions. |
| 21541 | 16 | No | Cannot complete ALTER TABLE command. Do not execute the command 'ALTER TABLE table_name DISABLE TRIGGER ALL' on a published table. Reissue multiple 'ALTER TABLE table_name DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_name' statements to disable each trigger individually on the given table. |
| 21542 | 16 | No | Encountered server error %d while executing \<%s\>. |
| 21543 | 16 | No | The schema for the article %s was either not generated properly or was not applied properly during initial synchronization. This may be due to permissions issues. Verify whether the object exists, and whether the necessary permissions are granted. |
| 21544 | 10 | No | Value specified for the publication property replicate_ddl is not valid. The value must be 1 or 0. |
| 21545 | 16 | No | You cannot disable a trigger used by merge replication on a published table. To drop the trigger, drop the table from the publication. |
| 21546 | 16 | No | Cannot replicate the ALTER TABLE command. It contains multiple DROP commands, including a DROP command for a column that is not included in all subscriptions to this article. Use a single DROP command in each ALTER TABLE command. |
| 21547 | 16 | No | Encountered server error %d while restoring the log for database %s. |
| 21548 | 16 | No | Cannot execute sp_change_subscription_properties. This stored procedure can only be used for publications that have at least one pull subscription. |
| 21549 | 16 | No | Cannot add the computed column '%s' to the publication. You must first add all columns on which this column depends; you cannot filter any of these colunmns from the article. |
| 21550 | 16 | No | Before you drop the column from the publication, all computed columns that depend on column '%s' must be dropped. |
| 21551 | 16 | No | Only members of the sysadmin or db_owner or db_ddladmin roles can perform this operation. |
| 21552 | 16 | No | Merge data definition language (DDL) error: Dropping a column used in a row filter or a join filter is not allowed. To drop a column used in a row filter, first change the row filter using sp_changemergearticle. To drop a column used in a join filter, first drop the join filter using sp_dropmergefilter. |
| 21561 | 16 | No | The value specified for parameter %s = %d is not valid. |
| 21564 | 16 | No | The table %s contains the column msrepl_tran_version, which is used by replication. The column is set to NULL, but it must be set to NOT NULL. Replication failed to alter this column, so you must drop the column and then add the table as an article again using sp_addarticle. Replication will then add the column to the table. |
| 21567 | 16 | No | The call format VCALL cannot be used for the specified article. VCALL format can be used only for articles in publications that allow updating subscriptions. If you do not require updating subscriptions, specify a different call format. If you do require updating subscriptions, you must drop the publication and re-create it to specify that updating subscriptions are allowed. |
| 21569 | 16 | No | The article %s in the publication %s does not have a valid conflict table entry in the system table sysarticleupdates. This entry is required for publications that allow queued updating subscriptions. Check for errors in the last run of the Snapshot Agent. |
| 21570 | 16 | No | Cannot create the logical record relationship. Table '%s' does not have a foreign key referencing table '%s'. A logical record relationship requires a foreign key relationship between the parent and child tables. |
| 21571 | 16 | No | Cannot create the logical record relationship in publication '%s'. The use_partition_groups option for the publication must be set to "true" in order to use logical records. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the option to "true". |
| 21572 | 16 | No | Cannot add a logical record relationship because the foreign key constraint '%s' on table '%s' is disabled. To create the logical record relationship, first enable the foreign key constraint. |
| 21573 | 16 | No | Cannot add a logical record relationship because the foreign key constraint '%s' on table '%s' is defined with the NOT FOR REPLICATION option. To add the logical record relationship, first drop the foreign key constraint, and then re-create it without the NOT FOR REPLICATION option. |
| 21574 | 16 | No | Cannot add a logical record relationship because the article '%s' is published in publication '%s', which has a compatibility level lower than 90RTM. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the publication_compatibility_level to 90RTM. |
| 21575 | 16 | No | The value specified for the property filter_type is not valid. Valid values are 1 (join filter only), 2 (logical record relation only), and 3 (join filter and logical record relation). |
| 21576 | 16 | No | Cannot add a logical record relationship between tables '%s' and '%s' because the foreign key column '%s' in table '%s' allows NULL values. Alter the column to disallow NULL values. |
| 21578 | 16 | No | In order to use partition_options of 2 (non overlapping partitions with multiple subscriptions per partition) or 3 (non overlapping partitions one subscription per partition) the publication '%s' must be enabled to use partition groups functionality. Use sp_changemergepublication to set 'use_partition_groups' to 'true'. |
| 21579 | 16 | No | Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article is involved in multiple join filters. Either select a value of 0 or 1 for the @partition_options parameter, or drop all but one of the join filters by using sp_dropmergefilter. |
| 21580 | 16 | No | Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article is involved in both a row filter and a join filter. Either select a value of 0 or 1 for the @partition_options parameter; drop the join filter by using sp_dropmergefilter; or change the row filter by using sp_changemergepublication. |
| 21581 | 16 | No | Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article has a join filter with a join_unique_key value of 0. Either select a value of 0 or 1 for the @partition_options parameter, or use sp_changemergefilter to specify a value of 1 for join_unique_key. |
| 21582 | 16 | No | Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article has a direct or indirect join filter relationship with parent article "%s". The parent article does not use the same value for partition_options. Use sp_changemergepublication to change the value for one of the articles. |
| 21583 | 16 | No | Cannot update the column in article '%s'. The article has a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the partition_options property, and the column is involved in a row filter and/or a join filter. In this situation, the column cannot be updated at a Subscriber or republisher; it must be updated at the top-level Publisher. |
| 21584 | 16 | No | Cannot insert the row for article '%s'. The row does not belong to the Subscriber's partition, and the article has a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the partition_options property. Nonoverlapping partitions do not allow out-of-partition inserts. |
| 21585 | 16 | No | Cannot specify custom article ordering in publication '%s' because the publication has a compatibility level lower than 90RTM. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the publication_compatibility_level to 90RTM. |
| 21597 | 16 | No | The article includes only the rowguidcol column. You must publish at least one other column. |
| 21598 | 16 | No | Modifying DDL triggers created by replication is disallowed since these are required to track DDL changes. |
| 21599 | 16 | No | The parameters @article and @join_articlename cannot have the same value. Specify different articles for the two parameters; self-joins are not permitted. |
| 21600 | 16 | No | Non-SQL Server Publisher \[%s\] cannot be found. Execute sp_helpdistpublishers to view a list of available Publishers. |
| 21601 | 16 | No | The value of the parameter @type must be 'logbased' for Oracle publications. |
| 21603 | 16 | No | The refresh of Oracle publisher '%s' by sp_refresh_heterogeneous_publisher was not successful. The Oracle publisher meta data has been retained in its failed state to help in diagnosing the cause of the failure. When the problem has been diagnosed and resolved, rerun sp_refresh_heterogeneous_publisher to complete the refresh. |
| 21604 | 16 | No | The non-SQL Server Publisher vendor is not valid. Attempt to add the Publisher again. If the problem persists, contact Microsoft Customer Support Services. |
| 21605 | 16 | No | Non-SQL Server Publishers must be configured in the context of the distribution database. Execute sp_adddistpublisher in the context of the distribution database. |
| 21606 | 16 | No | Parameter "%s" is for non-SQL Server Publishers only. The value of this parameter must be "%s" for a SQL Server Publisher. |
| 21607 | 16 | No | sp_refresh_heterogeneous_publisher was unable to obtain publisher information for Oracle publisher '%s'. sp_refresh_heterogeneous_publisher may only be called to refresh Oracle publishers currently defined at the distributor. |
| 21608 | 16 | No | Cannot use a value of TRUE for the parameter @ignore_distributor. The value must be FALSE for a non-SQL Server Publisher. |
| 21609 | 16 | No | Non-SQL Server publications do not support updatable subscriptions. The properties allow_sync_tran and allow_queued_tran must be "false". |
| 21610 | 16 | No | The failed attempt by sp_refresh_heterogeneous_publisher to refresh publisher '%s' did not alter any meta data at the Oracle publisher. Make certain that the correct Oracle publisher has been identified and that the requirements for refreshing the Oracle publisher have been met. |
| 21611 | 16 | No | Cannot drop the distribution Publisher "%s" because it has publications defined. Drop the publications first. |
| 21612 | 16 | No | For non-SQL Server Publishers, the value of the @sync_method parameter must be "character" or "concurrent_c". |
| 21613 | 16 | No | Constraint column '%s' not found in table '%s'. |
| 21614 | 16 | No | Index column '%s' not found in table '%s', |
| 21615 | 16 | No | Unable to find table information for article %s. Local distributor cache may be corrupt. |

| 21749 | 16 | No | The Publisher was dropped at the Distributor, but information on the Publisher '%s' was not dropped. Connect to the Oracle Publisher with SQL\*PLUS and drop the replication administrative user. |
| 21750 | 16 | No | The table %s does not have a primary key, which is required for transactional replication. Create a primary key on the table. |
| 21751 | 16 | No | Cannot publish view %s as a table because it does not have a unique clustered index. Publish the view as a view, or add a unique clustered index. |
| 21752 | 16 | No | The current user %s does not have SELECT permission on the table %s. The user must have SELECT permission to retrieve rows at the Subscriber that have updates pending in the queue. |
| 21753 | 16 | No | The table %s, which is specified in the @tablename parameter of sp_getqueuedrows, is not part of any active initialized queued subscription. Ensure your queued subscriptions are properly initialized by running the Snapshot Agent, Distribution Agent, and Queue Reader Agent. |
| 21754 | 16 | No | Processing has been terminated. The resultset for sp_getqueuedrows is larger than 16,000, the maximum size that the procedure can return. Run the Queue Reader Agent to flush the queue at the Subscriber before executing this procedure again. |
| 21755 | 16 | No | Failed to mark '%s' as a system object. |
| 21756 | 16 | No | Based on article settings, table %s should have an identity column, but it does not have one. Verify article settings with sp_helparticle and change them if necessary with sp_changearticle. |
| 21757 | 16 | No | The subscription is read-only. The publication that this subscription synchronizes with allows updates at the Subscriber, but a value of 'read-only' was specified for the @update_mode parameter of sp_addsubscription. To allow updates, you must drop and then re-create the subscription, specifying a different value for @update_mode. |
| 21758 | 16 | No | Cannot find a valid Queue Reader Agent ID for the subscription to Publisher %s, database %s, publication %s. The specified subscription to an updating Subscriber publication is not initialized. Run the Snapshot Agent, Distribution Agent, and Queue Reader Agent to initialize the subscription. |
| 21759 | 16 | No | Cannot add the column '%s' to the table '%s'. The table already contains the maximum number of columns allowed for an article in a merge publication (246 columns). |
| 21760 | 11 | No | Cannot execute the replication script in the 'master' database; the current session will be terminated. The script must be executed in the distribution database, and the master database cannot serve as the distribution database. |

| 21806 | 16 | No | The agent profile creation process cannot validate the specified agent parameter value: the profile_id %d does not exist or it does not support the parameter %s. The value must be an integer. Verify that replication is installed properly and that sp_add_agent_parameter is invoked with a valid value. |
| 21807 | 16 | No | For a .NET Assembly Business Logic Handler, the @resolver_clsid must be specified as NULL. |
| 21808 | 16 | No | For a .NET Assembly Business Logic Handler, the @resolver_info must contain the class name in '%s' that implements the Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.BusinessLogicSupport.BusinessLogicModule interface. |
| 21809 | 10 | No | DDL replication is not enabled for database '%ls' because its compatibility level is less than 80. |
| 21810 | 16 | No | Identity column can only be added to a published table with 'Not For Replication' clause |
| 21811 | 16 | No | Cannot drop the column '%s' because it is used by replication: it is referenced in a filter or view by article '%s'. To drop the column, you must first remove the filter from the article. |
| 21812 | 16 | No | Cannot perform "Disable Trigger All" on table %s because it belongs to a publication that supports updatable subscriptions (replication adds triggers to tables for these types of publications). You may, however, disable user triggers individually. Specify an individual user trigger name to disable. |
| 21813 | 16 | No | Can not disable trigger %s on table %s because it is required by updatable publication. |
| 21814 | 16 | No | DDL replication failed to refresh custom procedures, please run "exec sp_register_custom_scripting 'CUSTOM_SCRIPT', your_script, '%s', '%s' "and try again |
| 21815 | 16 | No | Can not alter replicated object '%s' to 'with encrypted'. |

| 21839 | 16 | No | Article '%s' can not support schema_option 0x20 or 0x2000000000 because it contains computed column, check/default constraint or primary key which is based on CLR type column, change @schema_option setting and try again. |
| 21840 | 16 | No | Can not add CLR type based computed column or check constraint to table '%s' because article '%s' supports schema_option 0x20. |
| 21841 | 10 | No | DDL replication is forcing reinitialization because either publication'%s' uses character mode bcp, or timestamp/identity column is being replicated as base type only for article '%s'. |
| 21842 | 16 | No | %s can only be specified/changed for heterogeneous publications when %s is set to %s. |
| 21843 | 16 | No | Article '%s' can not be added, an indexed view published as 'indexed view logbased' and a stored procedure in either form of 'proc exec' can not be published if their common base table is also published. |
| 21844 | 16 | No | Can not alter XML, CLR type or MAX type column because table is published and article '%s' supports the schema option to map this to a base column type. |
| 21845 | 16 | No | Can not alter procedure '%s' to depend on an indexed view published as 'indexed view logbased' or a base table because the indexed view depends on this table as well. |
