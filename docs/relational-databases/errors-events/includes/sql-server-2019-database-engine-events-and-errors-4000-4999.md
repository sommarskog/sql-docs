| 4074 | 16 | No | Client drivers do not accept result sets that have more than 65,535 columns. |
| 4075 | 16 | No | The USE database statement failed because the database collation %.\*ls is not recognized by older client drivers. Try upgrading the client operating system or applying a service update to the database client software, or use a different collation. See SQL Server Books Online for more information on changing collations. |
| 4076 | 16 | No | The ALTER DATABASE statement failed because the database collation %.\*ls is not recognized by older client drivers. Try upgrading the client operating system or applying a service update to the database client software, or use a different collation. See SQL Server Books Online for more information on changing collations. |
| 4077 | 20 | No | The statement failed because the sql_variant value uses collation %.\*ls, which is not recognized by older client drivers. Try upgrading the client operating system or applying a service update to the database client software, or use a different collation. See SQL Server Books Online for more information on changing collations. |
| 4078 | 16 | No | The statement failed because column '%.\*ls' (ID=%d) uses collation %.\*ls, which is not recognized by older client drivers. Try upgrading the client operating system or applying a service update to the database client software, or use a different collation. See SQL Server Books Online for more information on changing collations. |
| 4079 | 16 | No | The statement failed due to arithmetic overflow when sending data stream. |
| 4080 | 16 | No | The incoming tabular data stream (TDS) protocol stream is incorrect. The TRACE TDS header contained errors. |
| 4081 | 16 | No | The parameter '%.\*ls' was deduced to be a table-valued parameter, which cannot be sent by client driver versions earlier than SQL Server 2008. Please resubmit the query using a more recent client driver. |
| 4082 | 16 | No | Cannot recover the session state requested by the login. |
| 4083 | 16 | No | The connection was recovered and rowcount in the first query is not available. Please execute another query to get a valid rowcount. |
| 4101 | 16 | No | Aggregates on the right side of an APPLY cannot reference columns from the left side. |
| 4102 | 15 | No | The READPAST lock hint is only allowed on target tables of UPDATE and DELETE and on tables specified in an explicit FROM clause. |
| 4103 | 15 | No | "%.\*ls": Temporary views are not allowed. |
| [4104](../mssqlserver-4104-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | The multi-part identifier "%.\*ls" could not be bound. |
| 4105 | 16 | No | User-defined functions, partition functions, and column references are not allowed in expressions in this context. |
| 4107 | 16 | No | Inserting into remote tables or views is not allowed by using the BCP utility or by using BULK INSERT. |
| 4108 | 16 | No | Windowed functions can only appear in the SELECT or ORDER BY clauses. |
| 4109 | 16 | No | Windowed functions cannot be used in the context of another windowed function or aggregate. |
| 4110 | 16 | No | The argument type "%s" is invalid for argument %d of "%s". |
| 4111 | 16 | No | The CREATE SCHEMA statement should be followed by a name or authorization keyword. |
| 4112 | 16 | No | The function '%.\*ls' must have an OVER clause with ORDER BY. |
| 4113 | 16 | No | The function '%.\*ls' is not a valid windowing function, and cannot be used with the OVER clause. |
| 4114 | 16 | No | The function '%.\*ls' takes exactly %d argument(s). |
| 4115 | 16 | No | The reference to column "%.\*ls" is not allowed in an argument to a TOP, OFFSET, or FETCH clause. Only references to columns at an outer scope or standalone expressions and subqueries are allowed here. |
| 4116 | 16 | No | The function 'ntile' takes only a positive int or bigint expression as its input. |
| 4117 | 16 | No | Cannot retrieve table data for the query operation because the table "%.\*ls" schema is being altered too frequently. Because the table "%.\*ls" contains a computed column, changes to the table schema require a refresh of all table data. Retry the query operation, and if the problem persists, use SQL Server Profiler to identify what schema-altering operations are occurring. |
| 4118 | 16 | No | An invalid expression was specified in the FOR UPDATE clause. |
| 4119 | 16 | No | Default values cannot be assigned to property setters of columns with a CLR type. |
| 4120 | 16 | No | A user-defined function name cannot be prefixed with a database name in this context. |
| 4121 | 16 | No | Cannot find either column "%.\*ls" or the user-defined function or aggregate "%.\*ls", or the name is ambiguous. |
| 4122 | 16 | No | Remote table-valued function calls are not allowed. |
| 4124 | 16 | No | The parameters supplied for the batch are not valid. |
| 4126 | 16 | No | No full-text indexed columns were found. |
| 4127 | 16 | No | At least one of the arguments to COALESCE must be an expression that is not the NULL constant. |
| 4128 | 16 | No | An internal error occurred during remote query execution. Contact your SQL Server support professional and provide details about the query you were trying to run. |
| 4129 | 16 | No | The inline function "%.\*ls" cannot take correlated parameters or subqueries because it uses a full-text operator. |
| 4130 | 16 | No | A duplicate hint was specified for the BULK rowset. |
| 4131 | 16 | No | A compile-time literal value is specified more than once for the variable "%.\*ls" in one or more OPTIMIZE FOR clauses. |
| 4132 | 16 | No | The value specified for the variable "%.\*ls" in the OPTIMIZE FOR clause could not be implicitly converted to that variable's type. |
| 4133 | 16 | No | Only a scalar expression may be specified as the argument to the RETURN statement. |
| 4134 | 16 | Yes | Metadata stored on disk for computed column '%.\*ls' in table '%.\*ls' did not match the column definition. In order to avoid possible index corruption, please drop and recreate this computed column. |
| 4135 | 16 | No | Synonym '%.\*ls' is defined over queue '%.\*ls'. Synonyms on queues are not allowed. |
| 4136 | 16 | No | The hint '%.\*ls' cannot be used with the hint '%.\*ls'. |
| 4137 | 16 | No | A format file cannot be specified together with SINGLE_BLOB, SINGLE_CLOB or SINGLE_NCLOB option. |
| 4138 | 16 | No | Conflicting locking hints are specified for table "%.\*ls". This may be caused by a conflicting hint specified for a view. |
| 4139 | 16 | No | Cannot process the query because it references the common language runtime (CLR) table-valued function "%.\*ls" with a hint through view "%.\*ls". |
| 4140 | 15 | No | The READCOMMITTEDLOCK lock hint is not allowed on the target table of an INSERT statement. |
| 4141 | 16 | No | Nested CLR type updates are not allowed. |
| 4142 | 16 | No | Aggregates are not allowed in the RECEIVE list. |
| 4143 | 16 | No | The bulk openrowset provider is not a valid target for %.\*ls. |
| 4144 | 16 | No | The hint '%.\*ls' is not allowed when inserting into remote tables. |
| 4145 | 15 | No | An expression of non-boolean type specified in a context where a condition is expected, near '%.\*ls'. |
| 4146 | 16 | No | Statistics can only be created on columns. |
| 4147 | 15 | No | The query uses non-ANSI outer join operators ("\*=" or "=\*"). To run this query without modification, please set the compatibility level for current database to 80, using the SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL option of ALTER DATABASE. It is strongly recommended to rewrite the query using ANSI outer join operators (LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN). In the future versions of SQL Server, non-ANSI join operators will not be supported even in backward-compatibility modes. |
| 4148 | 16 | No | XML methods are not allowed in a GROUP BY clause. |
| 4150 | 16 | No | Hints are not allowed on recursive common table expression (CTE) references. Consider removing hint from recursive CTE reference '%.\*ls'. |
| 4151 | 16 | No | The type of the first argument to NULLIF cannot be the NULL constant because the type of the first argument has to be known. |
| 4152 | 16 | No | Type "%.\*ls" is not a CLR type. |
| 4153 | 16 | No | Cannot treat data type "%ls" as data type "%ls". |
| 4154 | 16 | No | UNNEST can only take an expression of type multiset. |
| 4155 | 15 | No | The SELECT list for the nested INSERT statement can only contain one item. |
| 4156 | 16 | No | The target of nested insert, nested update, or nested delete must be of type multiset. |
| 4157 | 16 | No | "%.\*ls" is not a valid property, field, or method. |
| 4158 | 16 | No | The field "%.\*ls" is referenced more than once in the set list, either directly or through a property. |
| 4159 | 16 | No | Delayed CLR type instances require local base table column as an argument. |
| 4160 | 16 | No | Could not find suitable key in table '%.\*ls' for use in delayed CLR type fetching. |
| 4161 | 16 | No | Only CLR types are allowed in delayed CLR type fetching. |
| 4162 | 16 | No | A PROB_MATCH table can only be used inside of a PROB_MATCH query. |
| 4163 | 16 | No | A GROUP BY clause is required in a PROB_MATCH query. |
| 4164 | 16 | No | A GROUP BY clause in a PROB_MATCH query can only have key columns, and needs to include all the key columns. |
| 4165 | 16 | No | The score override argument, if present in one of the subqueries, must be present in all subqueries and must be the same constant and variable. |
| 4166 | 16 | No | Invalid PROB_MATCH subquery. |
| 4167 | 16 | No | Multiple PROB_MATCH subqueries can only refer to the same base table. |
| 4168 | 16 | No | Invalid PROB_MATCH project item in the PROB_MATCH SELECT list. |
| 4169 | 16 | No | Applying TREAT more than once to the same expression is not allowed in a full-text property reference. |
| 4170 | 16 | No | The (ANY) specification can only be applied to expressions of type multiset. |
| 4171 | 16 | No | Alias was not specified for an aggregate in the PROB_MATCH SELECT list. |
| 4172 | 16 | No | Incorrect use of full-text %s. |
| 4173 | 16 | No | "%.\*s" is not a valid scoring function name. |
| 4174 | 16 | No | Delayed CLR type instantiation fetch value query may only reference column of a large object or large value type. |
| 4175 | 16 | No | Nested updates cannot be performed on CLR types that are not Format.Structured. |
| 4176 | 16 | No | Too many parameters were specified for FULLTEXTTABLE of type "Simple". The maximum number of parameters is %d. |
| 4177 | 16 | No | The FROM clause of a PROB_MATCH query must consist of a single derived table. |
| 4184 | 16 | No | Cannot retrieve table data for the query operation because the table "%.\*ls" schema is being altered too frequently. Because the table "%.\*ls" contains a filtered index or filtered statistics, changes to the table schema require a refresh of all table data. Retry the query operation, and if the problem persists, use SQL Server Profiler to identify what schema-altering operations are occurring. |
| 4185 | 16 | No | This action cannot be performed on a system type. |
| [4186](../mssqlserver-4186-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | Column '%ls.%.\*ls' cannot be referenced in the OUTPUT clause because the column definition contains a subquery or references a function that performs user or system data access. A function is assumed by default to perform data access if it is not schemabound. Consider removing the subquery or function from the column definition or removing the column from the OUTPUT clause. |
| 4187 | 16 | No | Data type %ls of receiving variable cannot store all values of the data type %ls of column '%.\*ls' without data loss. |
| 4188 | 16 | No | Column or parameter '%.\*ls' has type '%ls' and collation '%.\*ls'. The legacy LOB types do not support UTF-8 or UTF-16 encodings. Use types varchar(max), nvarchar(max) or a collation which does not have the _SC or _UTF8 flags. |
| 4189 | 16 | No | Cannot convert to text/ntext or collate to '%.\*ls' because these legacy LOB types do not support UTF-8 or UTF-16 encodings. Use types varchar(max), nvarchar(max) or a collation which does not have the _SC or _UTF8 flags. |
| 4190 | 16 | No | PIVOT operator is not allowed in the recursive part of a recursive common table expression '%.\*ls'. |
| 4191 | 16 | No | Cannot resolve collation conflict for %ls operation. |
| 4192 | 16 | No | Cannot resolve collation conflict. |
| 4193 | 16 | No | '%.\*ls' is not a valid window frame and cannot be used with the OVER clause. |
| 4194 | 15 | No | RANGE is only supported with UNBOUNDED and CURRENT ROW window frame delimiters. |
| 4195 | 16 | No | The reference to column "%.\*ls" is not allowed in an argument to the NTILE function. Only references to columns at an outer scope or standalone expressions and subqueries are allowed here. |
| 4196 | 16 | No | Column '%ls.%.\*ls' cannot be referenced in the OUTPUT clause because the column definition contains an expression using a window function. |
| 4197 | 16 | No | An internal query compilation error occurred during binding. |
| 4198 | 16 | No | Collation '%.\*ls' is supported on Unicode data types only. Unicode-only collations cannot be used to specify partition function parameters. |
| 4199 | 16 | No | Argument value %d is invalid for argument %d of %ls function. |
| 4202 | 16 | No | BACKUP LOG is not possible because bulk logged changes exist in the database and one or more filegroups are unavailable. |
| 4208 | 16 | No | The statement %hs is not allowed while the recovery model is SIMPLE. Use BACKUP DATABASE or change the recovery model using ALTER DATABASE. |
| 4212 | 16 | No | Cannot back up the log of the master database. Use BACKUP DATABASE instead. |
| [4214](../mssqlserver-4214-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | BACKUP LOG cannot be performed because there is no current database backup. |
| 4215 | 10 | No | The log was not truncated because records at the beginning of the log are pending replication or Change Data Capture. Ensure the Log Reader Agent or capture job is running or use sp_repldone to mark transactions as distributed or captured. |
| 4217 | 10 | No | BACKUP LOG cannot modify the database because the database is read-only. The backup will continue, although subsequent backups will duplicate the work of this backup. |
| 4218 | 16 | No | Bulk-logged operations exist in the database. Perform a BACKUP LOG. |
| 4219 | 10 | No | The log backup chain is broken. You must perform a full database backup before you can perform a log backup. |
| 4220 | 16 | No | Cannot back up the log of the model database with NORECOVERY option. |
| 4221 | 16 | No | Login to read-secondary failed due to long wait on 'HADR_DATABASE_WAIT_FOR_TRANSITION_TO_VERSIONING'. The replica is not available for login because row versions are missing for transactions that were in-flight when the replica was recycled. The issue can be resolved by rolling back or committing the active transactions on the primary replica. Occurrences of this condition can be minimized by avoiding long write transactions on the primary. |
| 4302 | 16 | No | The option "%ls" conflicts with online restore. Remove the conflicting option and reissue the command. |
| 4303 | 16 | No | The roll forward start point is now at log sequence number (LSN) %.\*s. Additional roll forward past LSN %.\*s is required to complete the restore sequence. |
| 4305 | 16 | No | The log in this backup set begins at LSN %.\*ls, which is too recent to apply to the database. An earlier log backup that includes LSN %.\*ls can be restored. |
| 4307 | 16 | No | The online restore to database '%ls' failed. It may be appropriate to perform an offline restore instead. To force an offline restore, first take the database offline using the ALTER DATABASE statement. |
| 4308 | 10 | No | The online restore is complete, but WITH NORECOVERY was specified. Use RESTORE WITH RECOVERY to bring affected data online. |
| 4309 | 16 | No | The state of file "%ls" prevents restoring individual pages. Only a file restore is currently possible. |
| 4310 | 16 | No | RESTORE PAGE is not allowed on file "%ls" because the file is not online. |
| 4311 | 16 | No | RESTORE PAGE is not allowed from backups taken with earlier versions of SQL Server. |
| 4312 | 16 | No | This log cannot be restored because a gap in the log chain was created. Use more recent data backups to bridge the gap. |
| 4313 | 16 | No | obsolete |
| 4314 | 16 | No | obsolete |
| 4315 | 10 | No | Some files still require more restore steps before the online restore sequence can be completed. |
| 4318 | 16 | No | File '%ls' has been rolled forward to LSN %.\*ls. This log terminates at LSN %.\*ls, which is too early to apply the WITH RECOVERY option. Reissue the RESTORE LOG statement WITH NORECOVERY. |
| 4319 | 16 | No | A previous restore operation was interrupted and did not complete processing on file '%ls'. Either restore the backup set that was interrupted or restart the restore sequence. |
| 4320 | 16 | No | The file "%ls" was not fully restored by a database or file restore. The entire file must be successfully restored before applying this backup set. |
| 4322 | 10 | No | This backup set contains records that were logged before the designated point in time. The database is being left in the restoring state so that more roll forward can be performed. |
| 4323 | 16 | No | A previous RESTORE WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR operation left the database in a potentially damaged state. To continue this RESTORE sequence, all further steps must include the CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR option. |
| 4326 | 16 | No | The log in this backup set terminates at LSN %.\*ls, which is too early to apply to the database. A more recent log backup that includes LSN %.\*ls can be restored. |
| 4327 | 16 | No | The log in this backup set contains bulk-logged changes. Point-in-time recovery was inhibited. The database has been rolled forward to the end of the log. |
| 4328 | 16 | No | The file "%ls" is missing. Roll forward stops at log sequence number %.\*ls. The file is created at log sequence number (LSN) %.\*ls, dropped at LSN %.\*ls. Restore the transaction log beyond the point in time when the file was dropped, or restore data to be consistent with rest of the database. |
| 4329 | 10 | No | This log file contains records logged before the designated mark. The database is being left in the Restoring state so you can apply another log file. |
| 4330 | 16 | No | This backup set cannot be applied because it is on a recovery path that is inconsistent with the database. The recovery path is the sequence of data and log backups that have brought the database to a particular recovery point. Find a compatible backup to restore, or restore the rest of the database to match a recovery point within this backup set, which will restore the database to a different point in time. For more information about recovery paths, see SQL Server Books Online. |
| 4331 | 16 | No | The database cannot be recovered because the files have been restored to inconsistent points in time. |
| 4332 | 16 | No | RESTORE LOG has been halted. To use the database in its current state, run RESTORE DATABASE %ls WITH RECOVERY. |
| 4333 | 16 | No | The database cannot be recovered because the log was not restored. |
| 4334 | 16 | No | The named mark does not identify a valid LSN. |
| 4335 | 16 | No | The specified STOPAT time is too early. All or part of the database is already rolled forward beyond that point. |
| 4336 | 16 | No | The filegroup "%ls" has been dropped and cannot be restored into the online database. |
| 4337 | 16 | No | The file "%ls" has been dropped and cannot be restored into the online database. |
| 4338 | 16 | No | The STOPAT clause specifies a point too early to allow this backup set to be restored. Choose a different stop point or use RESTORE DATABASE WITH RECOVERY to recover at the current point. |
| 4339 | 10 | No | This RESTORE statement successfully performed some actions, but the database could not be brought online because one or more RESTORE steps are needed. Previous messages indicate reasons why recovery cannot occur at this point. |
| 4340 | 16 | No | The point-in-time clause of this RESTORE statement is restricted for use by RESTORE LOG statements only. Omit the clause or use a clause that includes a timestamp. |
| 4341 | 16 | No | This log backup contains bulk-logged changes. It cannot be used to stop at an arbitrary point in time. |
| 4342 | 16 | No | Point-in-time recovery is not possible unless the primary filegroup is part of the restore sequence. Omit the point-in-time clause or restore the primary filegroup. |
| 4343 | 16 | No | The database has been rolled forward to the end of this backup set and beyond the specified point in time. RESTORE WITH RECOVERY can be used to accept the current recovery point. |
| 4344 | 16 | No | RESTORE PAGE is not allowed on read-only databases or filegroups. |
| 4345 | 10 | No | Problems recording information in the msdb..suspect_pages table were encountered. This error does not interfere with any activity except maintenance of the suspect_pages table. Check the error log for more information. |
| 4346 | 16 | No | RESTORE PAGE is not allowed with databases that use the simple recovery model or have broken the log backup chain. |
| 4347 | 16 | No | The current restore sequence was previously interrupted during the transition to the online state. RESTORE DATABASE WITH RECOVERY can be used to complete the transition to online. |
| 4348 | 16 | No | The online restore to database '%ls' failed. It may be appropriate to perform an offline restore instead. An offline restore is initiated by using BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY. |
| 4349 | 16 | No | The log in this backup set begins at LSN %.\*ls, which is too recent to apply to the database. This restore sequence needs to initialize the log to start at LSN %.\*ls. Reissue the RESTORE LOG statement using an earlier log backup. |
