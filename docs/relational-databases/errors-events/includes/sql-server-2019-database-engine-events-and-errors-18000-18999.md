| Error | Severity | Event logged | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 18002 | 20 | Yes | Exception happened when running extended stored procedure '%.\*ls' in the library '%.\*ls'. SQL Server is terminating process %d. Exception type: %ls; Exception code: 0x%lx. To generate a minidump, create an xevent session using the dump routine event with the create dump action. |
| 18052 | 16 | No | Error: %d, Severity: %d, State: %d. |
| 18053 | 16 | No | Error: %d, Severity: %d, State: %d. (Params:%ls). The error is printed in terse mode because there was error during formatting. Tracing, ETW, notifications etc are skipped. |
| 18054 | 16 | Yes | Error %d, severity %d, state %d was raised, but no message with that error number was found in sys.messages. If error is larger than 50000, make sure the user-defined message is added using sp_addmessage. |
| 18055 | 20 | Yes | Exception %d, %d occurred when the server tried to reset connection %d. Because the server cannot recover from the failure to reset the connection, the connection has been dropped. Please contact Microsoft technical support. |
| 18056 | 20 | Yes | The client was unable to reuse a session with SPID %d, which had been reset for connection pooling. The failure ID is %d. This error may have been caused by an earlier operation failing. Check the error logs for failed operations immediately before this error message. |
| 18057 | 20 | Yes | Error: Failed to set up execution context. |
| 18058 | 17 | Yes | Failed to load format string for error %d, language id %d. Operating system error: %s. Check that the resource file matches SQL Server executable, and resource file in localized directory matches the file under English directory. Also check memory usage. |
| 18059 | 16 | Yes | The connection has been dropped because the principal that opened it subsequently assumed a new security context, and then tried to reset the connection under its impersonated security context. This scenario is not supported. See "Impersonation Overview" in Books Online. |
| 18060 | 16 | Yes | Failed to format string for error %d, language id %d. This may be caused by low memory in server, or error happening while formatting the message. |
| 18061 | 20 | Yes | The client was unable to join a session with SPID %d. This error may have been caused by an earlier operation failing or a change in permissions since the session was established. Check the error logs for failed operations immediately before this error message. |
| 18100 | 10 | Yes | Process ID %d was killed by hostname %.\*ls, host process ID %d. |
| 18113 | 10 | Yes | SQL Server shutdown after verifying system indexes. |
| 18124 | 10 | Yes | The default collation was successfully changed. |
| 18126 | 10 | Yes | Engine failed to load configuration for error detection, default configuration was applied. |
| 18127 | 10 | Yes | Engine is marking DB %d \[%.\*ls\] as SUSPECT in cloud DB mode due to error %d, severity %d, state %d. |

| 18225 | 10 | Yes | Tape '%s' (family ID %d, sequence %d, media_set_guid %s) is mounted on tape drive '%s'. This is an informational message only. No user action required |
| 18226 | 10 | Yes | Tape mount is being requested on drive '%s'. Expected volume has (Family ID %d, sequence %d). |
| 18227 | 10 | Yes | Unnamed tape (family ID %d, sequence %d, media_set_guid %s) is mounted on tape drive '%s'. This is an informational message only. No user action required. |
| 18228 | 10 | Yes | Tape mount request on drive '%s' is cancelled. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 18257 | 10 | Yes | %s: Device or media does not support %s. To access this feature, use a different device or media. |
| [18264](../mssqlserver-18264-database-engine-error.md) | 10 | Yes | Database backed up. Database: %s, creation date(time): %s(%s), pages dumped: %I64d, first LSN: %s, last LSN: %s, number of dump devices: %d, device information: (%s). This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 18265 | 10 | Yes | Log was backed up. Database: %s, creation date(time): %s(%s), first LSN: %s, last LSN: %s, number of dump devices: %d, device information: (%s). This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 18266 | 10 | Yes | Database file was backed up. Database: %s, creation date(time): %s(%s), file list: (%s), pages dumped: %I64d, number of dump devices: %d, device information: (%s). This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 18267 | 10 | Yes | Database was restored: Database: %s, creation date(time): %s(%s), first LSN: %s, last LSN: %s, number of dump devices: %d, device information: (%s). Informational message. No user action required. |
| 18268 | 10 | Yes | Log was restored. Database: %s, creation date(time): %s(%s), first LSN: %s, last LSN: %s, number of dump devices: %d, device information: (%s). This is an informational message. No user action is required. |
| 18269 | 10 | Yes | Database file was restored. Database: %s, creation date(time): %s(%s), file list: (%s), number of dump devices: %d, device information: (%s). This is an informational message. No user action is required. |
| 18270 | 10 | Yes | Database differential changes were backed up. Database: %s, creation date(time): %s(%s), pages dumped: %I64d, first LSN: %s, last LSN: %s, full backup LSN: %s, number of dump devices: %d, device information: (%s). This is an informational message. No user action is required. |
| 18271 | 10 | Yes | Database changes were restored. Database: %s, creation date(time): %s(%s), first LSN: %s, last LSN: %s, number of dump devices: %d, device information: (%s). This is an informational message. No user action is required. |
| 18272 | 16 | Yes | During restore restart, an I/O error occurred on checkpoint file '%s' (operating system error %s). The statement is proceeding but cannot be restarted. Ensure that a valid storage location exists for the checkpoint file. |
| 18273 | 16 | Yes | Could not clear '%s' bitmap in database '%s' because of error %d. As a result, the differential or bulk-logged bitmap overstates the amount of change that will occur with the next differential or log backup. This discrepancy might slow down later differential or log backup operations and cause the backup sets to be larger than necessary. Typically, the cause of this error is insufficient resources. Investigate the failure and resolve the cause. If the error occurred on a data backup, consider taking a data backup to create a new base for future differential backups. |
| 18274 | 10 | Yes | Tape '%s' was dismounted from drive '%s'. This is an informational message. No user action is required. |
| 18275 | 10 | Yes | Unnamed tape was dismounted from drive '%s'. This is an informational message. No user action is required. |

| 18277 | 10 | Yes | Database file changes were restored. Database: %s, creation date(time): %s(%s), file list: (%s), number of dump devices: %d, device information: (%s). This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 18279 | 16 | Yes | During a RESTORE operation, an I/O error occurred on checkpoint file '%s' (operating system error %s). Ensure that a valid storage location exists for the checkpoint file and try the operation again. |
| 18280 | 16 | Yes | The file %s is being removed from the database, but is not being removed from the filesystem because file snapshots are still associated with the file. |
