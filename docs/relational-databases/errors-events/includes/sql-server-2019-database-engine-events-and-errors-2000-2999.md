| Error | Severity | Event logged | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2001 | 10 | No | Cannot use duplicate parameter names. Parameter name '%.\*ls' listed more than once. |
| 2002 | 16 | No | Cannot create a procedure for replication with group number greater than one. |
| 2003 | 16 | No | Procedures with a group number cannot have parameters of XML, CLR or encrypted types. Parameter '%.\*ls' of procedure '%.\*ls' has type '%ls'. |
| 2004 | 16 | No | Procedure '%.\*ls' has already been created with group number %d. Create procedure with an unused group number. |
| 2005 | 16 | No | The table '%.\*ls' is unavailable and needs to be rebuilt. Rebuild the table offline. |
| 2007 | 10 | No | The module '%.\*ls' depends on the missing object '%.\*ls'. The module will still be created; however, it cannot run successfully until the object exists. |
| 2008 | 16 | No | The object '%.\*ls' is not a procedure so you cannot create another procedure under that group name. |
| 2009 | 10 | No | Procedure '%.\*ls' was created despite delayed name resolution warnings (if any). |
| 2010 | 16 | No | Cannot perform alter on '%.\*ls' because it is an incompatible object type. |
| 2011 | 16 | No | Index hints within a schema-bound object can be applied only to memory optimized tables. |
| 2012 | 16 | No | Variables of CLR type cannot be declared within schema-bound object. |
| 2013 | 10 | No | Warning: 'is_ms_shipped' property is turned off for %S_MSG '%.\*ls' because you do not have permission to create or alter an object with this property. |
| 2014 | 16 | No | Remote access is not allowed from within a schema-bound object. |
| [2020](../mssqlserver-2020-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | The dependencies reported for entity "%.\*ls" might not include references to all columns. This is either because the entity references an object that does not exist or because of an error in one or more statements in the entity. Before rerunning the query, ensure that there are no errors in the entity and that all objects referenced by the entity exist. |
| 2021 | 16 | No | The referenced entity '%.\*ls' was modified during DDL execution. Please retry the operation. |
| 2022 | 16 | No | Parsing errors were encountered in the %S_MSG '%.\*ls'. The dependencies referenced from this object could not be determined. |
| 2023 | 10 | No | Metadata was not updated for the schema-bound object '%ls'. |
| 2101 | 14 | No | Cannot %S_MSG a server level %S_MSG for user '%.\*ls' since there is no login corresponding to the user. |
| 2102 | 16 | No | Cannot %S_MSG %S_MSG '%.\*ls' since there is no user for login '%.\*ls' in database '%.\*ls'. |
| 2103 | 15 | No | Cannot %S_MSG trigger '%.\*s' because its schema is different from the schema of the target table or view. |
| 2104 | 14 | No | Cannot %S_MSG the %S_MSG '%.\*ls', because you do not have permission. |
| 2108 | 15 | No | Cannot %S_MSG %S_MSG on '%.\*ls' as the target is not in the current database. |
| 2110 | 15 | No | Cannot alter trigger '%.\*ls' on '%.\*ls' because this trigger does not belong to this object. Specify the correct trigger name or the correct target object name. |
| 2111 | 16 | No | Cannot %S_MSG trigger '%.\*ls' on %S_MSG '%.\*ls' because an INSTEAD OF %s trigger already exists on this object. |
| 2112 | 16 | No | Cannot create trigger '%.\*ls' on view '%.\*ls' because the view is defined with CHECK OPTION. |
| 2113 | 16 | No | Cannot %S_MSG INSTEAD OF DELETE or INSTEAD OF UPDATE TRIGGER '%.\*ls' on table '%.\*ls'. This is because the table has a FOREIGN KEY with cascading DELETE or UPDATE. |
| 2114 | 16 | No | Column '%.\*ls' cannot be used in an IF UPDATE clause because it is a computed column. |
| 2115 | 16 | No | Server level event notifications are disabled as the database msdb does not exist. |
| 2116 | 16 | No | Cannot CREATE EVENT NOTIFICATION to database '%.\*ls' because it is not a valid broker database. |
| 2117 | 16 | No | Cannot %S_MSG INSTEAD OF trigger '%.\*ls' on %S_MSG '%.\*ls' because the %S_MSG has a FILESTREAM column. |
