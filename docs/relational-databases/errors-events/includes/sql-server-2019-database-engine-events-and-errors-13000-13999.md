| 13938 | 16 | No | The target table '%.\*ls' of the INSERT statement cannot be on either side of an edge constraint relationship when the FROM clause contains a nested INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE statement. Found edge constraint '%.\*ls'. |

| 13943 | 16 | No | The final recursive quantifier must be greater than the initial recursive quantifier. |
| 13944 | 16 | No | Cannot truncate table '%.\*ls' because it is being referenced by an EDGE constraint. |
| 13945 | 16 | No | Cannot delete from a node table that is the target of both an edge constraint and a foreign key constraint on the $node_id column. |
| 13946 | 16 | No | Cannot create a foreign key constraint referencing the $node_id or $edge_id column of a graph table. |
| 13947 | 16 | No | Merge statements containing a MATCH clause do not support derived tables or views in the MATCH clause. |
| 13948 | 16 | No | The table name or alias '%.\*s' must be marked as FOR PATH to be used in the recursive section of a SHORTEST_PATH clause. |
| 13949 | 16 | No | The table name or alias '%.\*s' was marked as FOR PATH but was not used in the recursive section of a SHORTEST_PATH clause. |
| 13950 | 16 | No | Node table name or alias '%.\*ls' was used more than once in a SHORTEST_PATH recursive section. |
| 13951 | 16 | No | Aggregate function '%ls' is not supported with WITHIN GROUP (GRAPH PATH). |
| 13952 | 16 | No | No columns in the aggregate '%ls' WITHIN GROUP(GRAPH PATH) reference a recursive path. |
| 13953 | 16 | No | Columns in the aggregate '%ls' WITHIN GROUP(GRAPH PATH) reference more than one recursive path. |
| 13954 | 16 | No | Identifier '%.\*ls' in aggregate '%ls' WITHIN GROUP(GRAPH PATH) is not referencing a recursive path and cannot be used. |
| 13955 | 16 | No | Recursive MATCH queries cannot be used in a table-valued function. |
| 13956 | 16 | No | Recursive MATCH queries cannot be used on the right side of APPLY. |
| 13957 | 16 | No | Recursive MATCH queries cannot be used in subqueries. |
| 13958 | 16 | No | Internal Error: Unable to compile MATCH query with derived table or view '%.\*ls'. |
| 13959 | 16 | No | Introducing edge constraint '%.\*ls' on table '%.\*ls' may cause cycles or multiple cascade paths. Specify ON DELETE NO ACTION or modify other constraints. |
| 13960 | 16 | No | Cannot define edge constraint '%.\*ls' with cascaded DELETE on table '%.\*ls' because the table has an INSTEAD OF DELETE TRIGGER defined on it. |
| 13961 | 16 | No | The alias or identifier '%.\*ls' cannot be used in the select list, order by, group by, or having context. |
| 13962 | 16 | No | The alias or identifier '%.\*ls' is not the last node in a shortest path pattern. Only the last node in the path can be used with LAST_NODE(). |
| 13963 | 16 | No | Node table name or alias '%.\*s' refers to a derived table and cannot be used by the LAST_NODE function. |

| 13965 | 16 | No | The table name or alias '%.\*s' must use the LAST_NODE function to reference the last node in a shortest_path expression. |
| 13966 | 16 | No | A recursive quantifier expression exceeds the limit of %d. Consider the '+' syntax instead. |
| 13967 | 16 | No | Pseudocolumn '%.\*ls' is not supported for use as a partitioning column on a table or index. |
| 13968 | 16 | No | An explicit DROP INDEX is not allowed on index '%.\*ls'. It is being used for edge constraint enforcement. |
