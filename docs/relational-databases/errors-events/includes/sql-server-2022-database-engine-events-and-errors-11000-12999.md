| 11400 | 16 | No | ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement failed. Index '%.\*ls' on indexed view '%.\*ls' uses partition function '%.\*ls', but table '%.\*ls' uses non-equivalent partition function '%.\*ls'. Index on indexed view '%.\*ls' and table '%.\*ls' must use an equivalent partition function. |
| 11401 | 16 | No | ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement failed. Table '%.\*ls' is %S_MSG, but index '%.\*ls' on indexed view '%.\*ls' is %S_MSG. |
| 11402 | 16 | No | ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement failed. Target table '%.\*ls' is referenced by %d indexed view(s), but source table '%.\*ls' is only referenced by %d indexed view(s). Every indexed view on the target table must have at least one matching indexed view on the source table. |
| 11403 | 16 | No | ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement failed. Indexed view '%.\*ls' is not aligned with table '%.\*ls'. The partitioning column '%.\*ls' from the indexed view calculates its value from one or more columns or an expression, rather than directly selecting from the table partitioning column '%.\*ls'. Change the indexed view definition, so that the partitioning column is directly selected from table partitioning column '%.\*ls'. |
| 11404 | 16 | No | ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement failed. Target table '%.\*ls' is referenced by %d indexed view(s), but source table '%.\*ls' is only referenced by %d matching indexed view(s). Every indexed view on the target table must have at least one matching indexed view on the source table. |
| 11405 | 16 | No | ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement failed. Table '%.\*ls' is not aligned with the index '%.\*ls' on indexed view '%.\*ls'. The table is partitioned on column '%.\*ls', but the index on the indexed view is partitioned on column '%.\*ls', which is selected from a different column '%.\*ls' in table '%.\*ls'. Change the indexed view definition so that the partitioning column is the same as the table's partitioning column. |
| 11406 | 16 | No | ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement failed. Source and target partitions have different values for the DATA_COMPRESSION option. |
| 11407 | 16 | No | Vardecimal storage format can not be enabled for '%.\*ls'. Only Enterprise edition of SQL Server supports vardecimal. |
| 11408 | 16 | No | Cannot modify the column '%.\*ls' in the table '%.\*ls' to add or remove the COLUMN_SET attribute. To change a COLUMN_SET attribute of a column, either modify the table to remove the column and then add the column again, or drop and re-create the table. |
| [11409](../mssqlserver-11409-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | Cannot remove the column set '%.\*ls' in the table '%.\*ls' because the table contains more than 1025 columns. Reduce the number of columns in the table to less than 1025. |
| 11410 | 16 | No | Cannot modify the column '%.\*ls' in the table '%.\*ls' to a sparse column because the column has a default or rule bound to it. Unbind the rule or default from the column before designating the column as sparse. |
| 11411 | 16 | No | Cannot add the sparse column '%.\*ls' to the table '%.\*ls' because the data type of the column has a default or rule bound to it. Unbind the rule or default from the data type before adding the sparse column to the table. |
| 11412 | 16 | No | ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement failed because column '%.\*ls' does not have the same sparse storage attribute in tables '%.\*ls' and '%.\*ls'. |
| 11413 | 16 | No | ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement failed because column '%.\*ls' does not have the same column set property in tables '%.\*ls' and '%.\*ls'. |
| 11414 | 10 | No | Warning: Option %ls is not applicable to table %.\*ls because it does not have a clustered index. This option will be applied only to the table's nonclustered indexes, if it has any. |
| 11415 | 16 | No | Object '%.\*ls' cannot be disabled or enabled. This action applies only to foreign key and check constraints. |
| 11418 | 16 | No | Cannot %S_MSG table '%.\*ls' because the table either contains sparse columns or a column set column which are incompatible with compression. |
| 11420 | 16 | No | ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement failed. Indexed view '%.\*ls' references an object that does not participate in the ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement, therefore the WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY option cannot be used. Drop the indexes of this view or change its definition to reference only tables that participate in the ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement. |
| 11421 | 10 | Yes | An '%.\*ls' statement was executed on database '%.\*ls', table '%.\*ls' by hostname '%.\*ls', host process ID %d using the WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY options with MAX_DURATION = %d and ABORT_AFTER_WAIT = BLOCKERS.

| 12810 | 16 | No | The option '%.\*ls' was specified multiple times. |
| 12811 | 16 | No | The user options for the instance must be set to 0 in order to %S_MSG a contained database. |
| 12813 | 16 | No | Errors were encountered in the %S_MSG '%.\*ls' during compilation of the object. Either the containment option of the database '%.\*ls' was changed, or this object was present in model db and the user tried to create a new contained database. |
| 12814 | 16 | No | The object referenced as '%.\*ls' resolves differently in the target metadata collation '%.\*ls' than in the current metadata collation '%.\*ls'. |
| 12815 | 16 | No | The column referenced as '%.\*ls' resolves differently in the target metadata collation '%.\*ls' than in the current metadata collation '%.\*ls'. |
| 12816 | 16 | No | The type or XML schema collection referenced as '%.\*ls' resolves differently in the target metadata collation '%.\*ls' than in the current metadata collation '%.\*ls'. |
| 12817 | 16 | No | The reference to the variable, parameter or goto label '%.\*ls' resolves differently in the target metadata collation '%.\*ls' than in the current metadata collation '%.\*ls'. |
| 12818 | 16 | Yes | RECONFIGURE failed. Attempting to change the 'contained database authentication' value to 0 while there are existing contained databases requires a RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE. |
| 12819 | 16 | No | sp_migrate_user_to_contained cannot be used in a non-contained database (a database with CONTAINMENT set to NONE). |
| 12820 | 16 | No | sp_migrate_user_to_contained can not be used with a user with a password or a user type other than SQL Login. |
| 12821 | 16 | No | sp_migrate_user_to_contained cannot be used on a user used in the EXECUTE AS clause of a signed module. |
| 12822 | 16 | No | sp_migrate_user_to_contained cannot be used to copy a password to an old hash algorithm. |
| 12823 | 16 | No | sp_migrate_user_to_contained can not find the login for user '%.\*ls'. |
| 12824 | 16 | No | The sp_configure value 'contained database authentication' must be set to 1 in order to %S_MSG a contained database. You may need to use RECONFIGURE to set the value_in_use. |
| 12826 | 16 | Yes | RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE set the 'contained database authentication' to 0 while there are contained databases in use. This will disrupt authentication for contained users and will not allow new contained databases to be created. |
| 12827 | 16 | No | User-named %ls constraint '%.\*ls' is not allowed on temp table '%.\*ls' because it is being created in a contained database. Please consult the Books Online topic Understanding Contained Databases for more information on contained databases. |
| 12828 | 16 | No | User-defined %S_MSG '%.\*ls' in tempdb cannot be referenced from local temp table '%.\*ls' because the temp table is being created in a contained database. Please consult the Books Online topic Understanding Contained Databases for more information on contained databases. |
| 12829 | 16 | No | The stored procedure '%.\*ls' refers to a group of numbered stored procedures. Numbered stored procedures are not available in contained databases. Please consult the Books Online topic Understanding Contained Databases for more information on contained databases. |
| 12830 | 16 | No | The sp_configure 'user options' setting must be zero if the Database Engine has contained databases. |
| 12831 | 16 | No | Database '%.\*ls' is a contained database. The option 'contained database authentication' setting is 0. Users with passwords will not be able to login to contained databases. |
| 12832 | 16 | Yes | The database '%.\*ls' could not be created or altered to a contained database, because the schema bound %S_MSG '%.\*ls' depends on builtin function '%s'. In a contained database, the output collation of this builtin function has changed to '%.\*ls', which differs from the collation used in a non-contained database. |
| 12833 | 16 | Yes | The database '%.\*ls' could not be created or altered to a contained database, because the check constraint '%.\*ls' on table '%.\*ls' depends on builtin function '%s'. In a contained database, the output collation of this builtin function has changed to '%.\*ls', which differs from the collation used in a non-contained database. |
| 12834 | 16 | Yes | The database '%.\*ls' could not be created or altered to a contained database, because the computed column '%.\*ls' on %S_MSG '%.\*ls' depends on builtin function '%s'. In a contained database, the output collation of this builtin function has changed to '%.\*ls', which differs from the collation used in a non-contained database. |
| 12835 | 10 | Yes | The definition of the %S_MSG '%.\*ls' was refreshed as part of altering the containment option of the database '%.\*ls' because the object depends on builtin function '%s'. In a contained database, the output collation of this builtin function has changed to '%.\*ls', which differs from the collation used in a non-contained database. |
| 12836 | 16 | Yes | ALTER DATABASE statement failed. The containment option of the database '%.\*ls' could not be altered because compilation errors were encountered during validation of SQL modules. See previous errors. |
| 12837 | 16 | Yes | CREATE DATABASE statement failed. The contained database '%.\*ls' could not be created because compilation errors were encountered during validation of SQL modules. See previous errors. |
| 12838 | 16 | Yes | Replication, Change Data Capture and Change Tracking are not supported in contained databases. The database '%.\*ls' cannot be altered to a contained database, since it has one of these options turned on. |
| 12839 | 16 | Yes | Replication, Change Data Capture, Change Feed and Change Tracking are not supported in contained databases. The option cannot be enabled on the contained database '%s'. |
| 12840 | 16 | No | CREATE DATABASE failed. Recollating the database failed while creating the partially contained database '%.\*ls', with a default data collation of '%.\*ls'. |
| 12841 | 16 | No | ALTER DATABASE failed. Recollating the database failed while altering the database '%.\*ls' to containment='%ls'. |
| 12842 | 16 | No | The COLLATE CATALOG_DEFAULT clause cannot be used in a constraint, computed column, index filter expression, or any schema-bound object. |
| 12843 | 16 | Yes | The containment state of database '%.\*ls' does not match the value in master. Contained database functionality will not work as expected. Detach and re-attach the database to correct the database state in master. |
| 12844 | 16 | Yes | ALTER DATABASE statement failed; this functionality is not available in the current edition of SQL Server. |
| 12845 | 16 | Yes | CREATE DATABASE statement failed; cannot specify both CONTAINMENT = PARTIAL and CATALOG_COLLATION. |
| 12846 | 16 | Yes | Change Feed is not supported in contained databases. The database '%.\*ls' cannot be altered to a contained database, since Change Feed has been enabled. |
| 12980 | 16 | No | Supply either %s or %s to identify the log entries. |
| 12981 | 16 | No | You must specify %s when creating a subplan. |
| 12982 | 16 | No | Supply either %s or %s to identify the plan or sub-plan to be run. |
