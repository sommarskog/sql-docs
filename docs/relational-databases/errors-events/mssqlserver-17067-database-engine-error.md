|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|

|Message Text|SQL Server Assertion: File: \<%s>, line = %d %s. This error may be timing-related. If the error persists after rerunning the statement, use DBCC CHECKDB to check the database for structural integrity, or restart the server to ensure in-memory data structures are not corrupted.|  
  
## Explanation  
This error can be caused by transient, timing-related errors, or by in-memory or on-disk data corruption.  
  
## User Action
