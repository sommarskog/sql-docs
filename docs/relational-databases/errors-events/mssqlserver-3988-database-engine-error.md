# MSSQLSERVER_3988
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

## Details

|Attribute|Value|
|---|---|
|Product Name|SQL Server|
|Event ID|3988|
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|
|Component|SQLEngine|
|Symbolic Name|XACT_UNSUPPORT_PARALLEL_TRAN2|
|Message Text|New transaction is not allowed because there are other threads running in the session.|

## Explanation

This error occurs when you execute a distributed query that joins multiple tables hosted by remote instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] while the `XACT_ABORT` session setting is **ON**. An error message similar to the following is reported to the user:

> Msg 3988, Level 16, State 1, Line #  
New transaction is not allowed because there are other threads running in the session.

## Cause

There are some design limitations in the way [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] handles distributed queries (DQs) when the following conditions are true:

- SQL Server joins multiple tables of one remote [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data source.
- The session that is issuing the query is not enlisted in a distributed transaction.

In this situation, an attempt to run the query may raise either of the two errors that are mentioned in the **Explanation** section.

## User action

To work around the issue, enclose the distributed query in a 'begin distributed transaction' statement:

```sql
BEGIN DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION
/*The actual Distributed Query goes next, outside of comments*/
COMMIT TRANSACTION
```
