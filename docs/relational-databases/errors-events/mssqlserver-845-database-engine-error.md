# MSSQLSERVER_845
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  
## Details  
  
| Attribute | Value |  
| :-------- | :---- |  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|845|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|BUFLATCH_TIMEOUT|  
|Message Text|Time-out occurred while waiting for buffer latch type %d for page %S_PGID, database ID %d.|  
  
## Explanation  
A process was waiting to acquire a latch, but the process waited until the time limit expired and failed to acquire one. This can occur if an I/O operation takes too long to complete, usually as a result of other tasks blocking system processes. In some instances, this error may be the result of hardware failure.  
  
## Cause
This error message is dependent on the overall environment of your system. Any of the following circumstances may lead to an overstressed system:

- Hardware that doesn't meet your input/output (I/O) and memory needs
- Improperly configured and tested settings
- Inefficient design

 You may observe error 845 when your system is under a heavy load and can't meet the workload demands. Some of the most common causes of a stressed environment are:

- Hardware problems
- Compressed volumes
- Non-default [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] configuration settings
- Inefficient queries or index design
- Frequent database AutoGrow or AutoShrink operations

## User Action  
Try the following to prevent this error from occurring:  
  
- Determine if you have any hardware bottlenecks. See [Identifying Bottlenecks](../performance/identify-bottlenecks.md) for a good place to start. If necessary, upgrade your hardware so it can service the needs of your environment's configuration, queries, and load.

- Verify that all your hardware functions properly. Check for any logged errors and run any diagnostics provided by your hardware vendor. Check for associated I/O failures in error log or event log. I/O failures typically point to a disk malfunction.  
- Make sure that your disk volumes aren't compressed. Storing data and log files on compressed drives isn't supported, see [Database Files and Filegroups](../databases/database-files-and-filegroups.md). For additional information on compressed drive support, review the following article: [SQL Server Databases Not Supported on Compressed Volumes](https://support.microsoft.com/EN-US/help/231347)

- See if the error messages disappear when you turn off all the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] configuration options:
   - The [priority boost option](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-priority-boost-server-configuration-option.md)
   - The [lightweight pooling (fiber mode) option](../../database-engine/configure-windows/lightweight-pooling-server-configuration-option.md)
   - The [set working set size option](../../database-engine/configure-windows/set-working-set-size-server-configuration-option.md)

    For more information see [HOW TO: Determine Proper SQL Server Configuration Settings](https://support.microsoft.com/EN-US/help/319942)

- Tune queries to reduce resources used on the system. Performance tuning will help reduce the stress on a system and improve response time for individual queries
- Set the AutoShrink property to OFF to reduce the overhead of changes to your database size
- Make sure you set the AutoGrow property to increments that are large enough to be infrequent. Schedule a job to check the available space in your databases, and then increase the database size during non-peak hours.
- Check the error log for non-yielding tasks and other critical errors. Resolve those errors first as they could point to the root cause of the underlying issue.
- If critical errors such as asserts frequently occur, resolve these problems
- If the 845 error messages are infrequent, then you can ignore the errors
