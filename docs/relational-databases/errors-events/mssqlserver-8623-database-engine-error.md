|Symbolic Name|OPTIMIZER_NOPLAN_ERR|  
|Message Text|The query processor ran out of internal resources and could not produce a query plan. This is a rare event and only expected for extremely complex queries or queries that reference a very large number of tables or partitions. Please simplify the query. If you believe you've received this message in error, contact Customer Support Services for more information.|  
  
## Explanation  
The Query Optimizer is unable to generate a query plan due to either running out of resources or the query being too complex, two different states can be returned for this error

- State 1 - The query timed out due to the plan being too complex
- State 2 - The query ran out of resources - Memory


## User Action

Simplify the query by breaking the query into multiple queries along the largest dimension. First, remove any query elements that aren't necessary, then try adding a temp table and splitting the query in two. Note that if you move a part of the query to a subquery, function, or a common table expression that isn't sufficient because they get recombined into a single query by the compiler. You can also, try adding hints to force a plan earlier, for example OPTION (FORCE ORDER).
