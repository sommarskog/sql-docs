 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  
## Details  
  
| Attribute | Value |  
| :-------- | :---- |  
|Product Name|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]|  
|Event ID|41359|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|SQL_READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT_NOT_SUPPORTED|  
|Message Text|A query that accesses memory optimized tables using the READ COMMITTED isolation level, cannot access disk based tables when the database option READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT is set to ON. Provide a supported isolation level for the memory optimized table using a table hint, such as WITH (SNAPSHOT).|  
  
## Explanation  
The database with READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT=ON does not support the transactions that access both memory-optimized tables and disk based tables.  
  
## User Action  
Set READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT to OFF or supply a supported isolation level for the memory-optimized table using a table-level hint, such as WITH (SNAPSHOT). For more information, see [In-Memory OLTP &#40;In-Memory Optimization&#41;](~/relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/in-memory-oltp-in-memory-optimization.md).
