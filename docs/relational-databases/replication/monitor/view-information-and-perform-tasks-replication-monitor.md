# View information and perform tasks using Replication Monitor
[!INCLUDE[sql-asdbmi](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]
Replication monitor provides a number of tabs and options to view information and perform various tasks. This article describes the different things that can be viewed and accomplished when using Replication Monitor. 


## For a Publication

### View information
Replication Monitor provides the following tabs that include information about the selected publication:  
  
-   **All Subscriptions** - This tab displays information about all subscriptions to the selected publication.  
  
-   **Agents** - This tab displays information about all agents used by a publication:   
    -   The Snapshot Agent, which is used by all publications.   
    -   The Log Reader Agent, which is used by all transactional publications.   
    -   The Queue Reader Agent, which is used by transactional publications that have queued updating subscriptions.  
  
-   **Warnings** - This tab allows you to specify warnings and alerts for agents.  
  
-   **Tracer Tokens** (transactional replication only) - This tab allows you to measure latency, the amount of time that elapses between a transaction being committed at the Publisher and the corresponding transaction being committed at the Subscriber.  
  
 For more information about the options on each tab, select the tab in the right pane, and then select **Help** on the menu bar. For information about starting Replication Monitor, see [Start the Replication Monitor](../../../relational-databases/replication/monitor/start-the-replication-monitor.md).
