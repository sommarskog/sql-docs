# Breaking Changes in SQL Server Replication
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  This topic describes breaking changes in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Replication. These changes might break applications, scripts, or functionalities that are based on earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You might encounter these issues when you upgrade.  
  
## Breaking Changes Made in [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)]  
 [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] does not support replication to or from [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)].
