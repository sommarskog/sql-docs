|Message Text|Cannot alter the %S_MSG '%.*ls' because it is being published for replication.|  
  
## Explanation  
 This error typically occurs if you attempt to drop the primary key constraint on a table that is published for transactional replication. Transactional replication requires a primary key for each published table; therefore the constraint cannot be dropped.  
  
## User Action  
 To drop the constraint, first drop the article associated with the table. For more information, see [Add Articles to and Drop Articles from Existing Publications](../../relational-databases/replication/publish/add-articles-to-and-drop-articles-from-existing-publications.md). If this error occurs in a database that is not replicated, execute [sp_removedbreplication &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-removedbreplication-transact-sql.md) to ensure objects in the database are not marked as replicated.
