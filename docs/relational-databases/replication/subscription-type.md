# Subscription Type
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]
  Merge replication offers two subscription types: server and client (referred to in previous versions of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] as global and local, respectively). Subscribers with a server subscription can:  
  
-   Republish data to other Subscribers.  
  
-   Serve as alternate synchronization partners.  
  
-   Resolve conflicts according to a priority you set.  
  
 Most Subscribers do not require this functionality and can use a client subscription. Client subscriptions still allow conflict detection and resolution, but Subscribers are not assigned a priority: the first Subscriber to submit a change to the Publisher wins any conflicts that might arise from that change.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Subscription type cannot be changed after a subscription is created.  
  
## Options  
 **Subscription properties**  
 For each Subscriber, select **Client** or **Server** from the drop-down list box in the **Subscription Type** column. For Subscribers with server subscriptions, enter a number between 0 and 99.99 in the **Priority for Conflict Resolution** column (the higher the number, the higher the priority for the Subscriber).
