|Message Text|Subscriber '%s' subscription to article '%s' in publication '%s' failed data validation.|  
  
## Explanation  
 The data at the Subscriber was validated against the data at the Publisher, and the data did not match; therefore validation failed. For more information about validation, see [Validate Replicated Data](../../relational-databases/replication/validate-data-at-the-subscriber.md).  
  
## User Action  
 We recommend that you do the following:  
  
-   Determine why validation failed.  
  
-   Correct the underlying issue that caused the failure.  
  
-   Bring the data into convergence by reinitializing the subscription or through another method.
