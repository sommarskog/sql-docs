|Message Text|Could not drop the Distributor '%s'. This Distributor has associated distribution databases.|  
  
## Explanation  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance that is configured as a Distributor cannot be removed from the role of Distributor because there are distribution databases associated with the instance. This error occurs if you attempt to drop a distribution database that is associated with one or more Publishers.  
  
## User Action  
 To find the names of any Publishers and distribution databases associated with this Distributor, execute [sp_helpdistpublisher &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-helpdistpublisher-transact-sql.md) from any database on the Distributor.  
  
 Execute [sp_dropdistributiondb &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-dropdistributiondb-transact-sql.md) for any distribution databases associated with this Distributor. After all distribution database associations are removed, you can disable distribution.
