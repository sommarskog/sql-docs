# Bidirectional Transactional Replication
[!INCLUDE[sql-asdbmi](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]
  Bidirectional transactional replication is a specific transactional replication topology that allows two servers to exchange changes with each other: each server publishes data and then subscribes to a publication with the same data from the other server. The `@loopback_detection` parameter of [sp_addsubscription &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-addsubscription-transact-sql.md) is set to TRUE to ensure that changes are only sent to the Subscriber and do not result in the change being sent back to the Publisher.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] and later versions, this topology is also supported by peer-to-peer transactional replication, but bidirectional replication can provide improved performance.  

If you want to add a subscription to a bi-directional publication by using the  the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), verify that the server name (`@@SERVERNAME`) of the subscriber returns the FQDN. If the subscriber server name does not return the FQDN, changes that originate from that subscriber may cause primary key violations.
