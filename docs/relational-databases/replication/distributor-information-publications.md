# Distributor Information, Publications
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]
  The **Publications** tab provides summary information for all publications at the Distributor that is selected in the left pane.  
  
The information that is displayed about the publications supported by the Distributor includes a column that contains the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance of the Publisher. Otherwise, the publication information is the same as the publication information that is provided when you view publications in the Publisher view of Replication Monitor. For more information about the columns in the **Publications** tab, see [Publisher Information, Publications](../../relational-databases/replication/publisher-information-publications.md).  

## Subscription Watch List

### Transactional replication
  Information for transactional subscriptions includes the name of the Publisher. Otherwise, the functionality and the information that is provided in this dialog box is the same as in the Publisher view. For more information about how to use this dialog box, see [Publisher Information, Subscription Watch List &#40;Transactional Publication, SQL Server 2005 and Later&#41;](../../relational-databases/replication/publisher-information-subscription-watch-list-transactional.md). 

### Merge replication
  Information for merge publication subscriptions includes the name of the Publisher. Otherwise, the functionality and the information that is provided in this dialog box is the same as in the Publisher view. For more information about how to use this dialog box, see [Publisher Information, Subscription Watch List &#40;Merge Publication, SQL Server 2005 and Later&#41;](../../relational-databases/replication/publisher-information-subscription-watch-list-merge-publication.md).  

### Snapshot replication 
  Information for snapshot publication subscriptions includes the name of the Publisher. Otherwise, the functionality and the information that is provided in this dialog box is the same as in the Publisher view. For more information about how to use this dialog box, see [Publisher Information, Subscription Watch List &#40;Snapshot Publication, SQL Server 2005 and Later&#41;](../../relational-databases/replication/publisher-information-subscription-watch-list-snapshot.md).  

## Agents
The **Agents** tab displays information about the agents and maintenance jobs that are associated with the Publisher and Subscriber.  
  
 The agents that are available in the **Agents** tab for a Distributor in Distributor view include all the agents that are available in the **Agents** tab for a Publisher. However, the **Agents** tab for a Distributor in Distributor view also includes a Distributor Agent and a Merge Agent.  
  
 For more information about the Snapshot, Log Reader, and Queue Reader agents, and maintenance jobs, see [Publisher Information, Agents](../../relational-databases/replication/publisher-information-agents.md). Notice that when you are viewing agent information on the **Agents** tab for a Distributor, Publisher information is present for the Snapshot and Log Reader agents. However, in the **Agents** tab for a Distributor in Distributor view, you can also select **Distributor Agent** and **Merge Agent**.
