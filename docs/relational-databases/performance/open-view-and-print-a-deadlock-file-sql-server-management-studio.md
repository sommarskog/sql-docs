# Open, view, and print a deadlock file in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]
  When [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] generates a deadlock, you can capture and save the deadlock information to a file. After you've saved the deadlock file, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to view it or print it.  
  
## Open and view a deadlock file  
  
1. On the **File** menu in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], point to **Open**, and then select **File**.  
  
2. In the **Open File** dialog box, select the .xdl file type in the **Files of type** box. You now have a filtered list of only deadlock files.  
  
## Print a deadlock file  
  
1. On the **File** menu in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], point to **Open**, and then select **File**.  
  
2. In the **Open File** dialog box, select the .xdl file type in the **Files of type** box. You now have a filtered list of only deadlock files.  
  
3. Select the deadlock file you want to print, and select **Open**.  
  
4. On the **File** menu, select **Print**.
