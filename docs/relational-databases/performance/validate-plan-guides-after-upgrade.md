# Validate plan guides after upgrade
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb.md)]

We recommend re-evaluating and testing plan guide definitions when you upgrade your application to a new release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Performance tuning requirements and plan guide matching behavior may change. Although an invalid plan guide will not cause a query to fail, the plan is compiled without using the plan guide and may not be the best choice. After upgrading a database to a newer version of the [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)], we recommend that you perform the following tasks:
  
- Validate existing plan guides by using the [sys.fn_validate_plan_guide](../../relational-databases/system-functions/sys-fn-validate-plan-guide-transact-sql.md) function.  
  
- Use extended events to monitor for misguided plans for some period of time by using the [Plan Guide Unsuccessful](../../relational-databases/event-classes/plan-guide-unsuccessful-event-class.md) event.
