# Intelligent query processing in SQL databases

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

The intelligent query processing (IQP) feature family includes features with broad impact that improve the performance of existing workloads with minimal implementation effort to adopt. The following graphic details the family of IQP features and when they were first introduced for SQL Server. All IQP features are available in [!INCLUDE[ssazuremi_md](../../includes/ssazuremi_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]. Some features depend on the database's compatibility level.

For demos and sample code of intelligent query processing (IQP) features on GitHub, visit [https://aka.ms/IQPDemos](https://aka.ms/IQPDemos).

You can make workloads automatically eligible for intelligent query processing by enabling the applicable database compatibility level for the database. You can set this using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. For example:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE [WideWorldImportersDW] SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 160;
```

The following table details all intelligent query processing features, along with any requirement they have for database compatibility level. For complete details on all IQP features, including release notes and more in-depth descriptions, see [Intelligent query processing (IQP) feature details](intelligent-query-processing-details.md).
