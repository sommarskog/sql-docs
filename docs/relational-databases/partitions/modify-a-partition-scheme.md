# Modify a partition scheme

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

You can modify a partition scheme in SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Managed Instance by designating a filegroup to hold the next partition that is added to a partitioned table using [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../../ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md) or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. You do this by assigning the NEXT USED property to a filegroup. 

You can assign the NEXT USED property to an empty filegroup or to one that already holds a partition. In other words, a filegroup can hold more than one partition. Learn more about filegroups and  partitioning strategies in the [Filegroups](partitioned-tables-and-indexes.md#filegroups).

Table partitioning is also available in dedicated SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics, with some syntax differences. Learn more in [Partitioning tables in dedicated SQL pool](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-tables-partition).
 
##  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations

Any filegroup affected by ALTER PARTITION SCHEME must be online.  

> [!NOTE]
> Azure SQL Database supports only the `PRIMARY` filegroup.  
  
## Permissions  

The following permissions can be used to execute ALTER PARTITION SCHEME:  
  
-   ALTER ANY DATASPACE permission. This permission defaults to members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role and the **db_owner** and **db_ddladmin** fixed database roles.  
  
-   CONTROL or ALTER permission on the database in which the partition scheme was created.  
  
-   CONTROL SERVER or ALTER ANY DATABASE permission on the server of the database in which the partition scheme was created.
  
## Modify a partition scheme with Transact-SQL

This example uses the [AdventureWorks sample database](../../samples/adventureworks-install-configure.md).
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, select **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and select **Execute**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For simplicity, this code creates new filegroups but does not assign files to them. This  allows the demonstration of how to modify the partition scheme but is not a complete example of configuring a partitioned object. Find examples of creating partitioned tables and indexes in [Create partitioned tables and indexes](create-partitioned-tables-and-indexes.md).
  
    ```sql
    USE AdventureWorks2022;  
    GO
    -- add five new filegroups to the AdventureWorks2022 database  
    ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2022  
    ADD FILEGROUP test1fg;  
    GO  
    ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2022  
    ADD FILEGROUP test2fg;  
    GO  
    ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2022  
    ADD FILEGROUP test3fg;  
    GO  
    ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2022  
    ADD FILEGROUP test4fg;  
    GO  
    ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2022  
    ADD FILEGROUP test5fg;  
    GO 

    -- if the "myRangePF1" partition function and the "myRangePS1" partition scheme exist,  
    -- drop them from the AdventureWorks2022 database  
    IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.partition_functions  
        WHERE name = 'myRangePF1')  
    DROP PARTITION FUNCTION myRangePF1;  
    GO  
    IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.partition_schemes  
        WHERE name = 'myRangePS1')  
    DROP PARTITION SCHEME myRangePS1;  
    GO  

    -- create the new partition function "myRangePF1" with four partition groups  
    CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION myRangePF1 (int)  
    AS RANGE LEFT FOR VALUES ( 1, 100, 1000 );  
    GO  

    -- create the new partition scheme "myRangePS1"that will use   
    -- the "myRangePF1" partition function with five file groups.  
    -- The last filegroup, "test5fg," will be kept empty but marked  
    -- as the next used filegroup in the partition scheme.  
    CREATE PARTITION SCHEME myRangePS1  
    AS PARTITION myRangePF1  
    TO (test1fg, test2fg, test3fg, test4fg, test5fg);  
    GO  

    --Split "myRangePS1" between boundary_values 100 and 1000  
    --to create two partitions between boundary_values 100 and 500  
    --and between boundary_values 500 and 1000.  
    ALTER PARTITION FUNCTION myRangePF1 ()  
    SPLIT RANGE (500);  
    GO  

    -- Allow the "myRangePS1" partition scheme to use the filegroup "test5fg"  
    -- for the partition with boundary_values of 100 and 500  
    ALTER PARTITION SCHEME myRangePS1  
    NEXT USED test5fg;  
    GO  
    ```  

## Delete a partition scheme with SSMS

1. In **Object Explorer**, connect to your target database.

1. Select the plus sign to expand the database where you want to delete the partition scheme.  
  
1. Select the plus sign to expand the **Storage** folder.  
  
1. Select the plus sign to expand the **Partition Schemes** folder.  
  
1. Right-click the partition scheme you want to delete and select **Delete**.  
  
1. In the **Delete Object** dialog box, ensure that the correct partition scheme is selected, and then select **OK**.
