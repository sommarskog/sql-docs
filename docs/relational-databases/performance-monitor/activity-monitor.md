# Activity Monitor
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Activity Monitor in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) displays information about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] processes and how these processes affect the current instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. We recommend that you [download and install the latest version of SSMS](../../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).
  
Activity Monitor is a tabbed document window with the following expandable and collapsible panes: **Overview**, **Processes**, **Resource Waits**, **Data File I/O**, **Recent Expensive Queries**, and **Active Expensive Queries**. When any pane is expanded, Activity Monitor queries the instance for information. When a pane is collapsed, all querying activity stops for that pane. You can  expand one or more panes at the same time to view different kinds of activity on the instance.  
 
## Customize columns 
For columns included in the **Processes**, **Resource Waits**, **Data File I/O**, **Recent Expensive Queries**, and **Active Expensive Queries** panes, customize the display as follows:  
  
1.  To rearrange column order, select the column heading and drag it to another location in the heading ribbon.  
  
2.  To sort a column, select the column name.  
  
3.  To filter on one or more columns, select the drop-down arrow in the column heading, and then select a value.
