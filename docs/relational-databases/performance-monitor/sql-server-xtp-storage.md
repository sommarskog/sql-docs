# SQL Server XTP Storage object
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  The **SQL Server XTP Storage** performance object contains counters related to on-disk storage for In-Memory OLTP in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 This table describes the **SQL Server XTP Storage** counters.  
  
|Counter|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|**Checkpoints Closed**|Count of checkpoints closed done by online agent.|  
|**Checkpoints Completed**|Count of checkpoints processed by offline checkpoint thread.|  
|**Core Merges Completed**|The number of core merges completed by the merge worker thread. These merges still need to be installed.|  
|**Merge Policy Evaluations**|The number of merge policy evaluations since the server started.|  
|**Merge Requests Outstanding**|The number of merge requests outstanding since the server started.|  
|**Merges Abandoned**|The number of merges abandoned due to failure.|  
|**Merges Installed**|The number of merges successfully installed.|  
|**Total Files Merged**|The total number of source files merged. This count can be used to find the average number of source files in the merge.|  
  
 
## Example

You begin to explore the query performance counters in this object using this T-SQL query on the [sys.dm_os_performance_counters](../system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-performance-counters-transact-sql.md) dynamic management view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters
WHERE object_name LIKE '%XTP Storage%';
```
