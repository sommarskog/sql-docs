|**Io Issued/sec**|Number of Io issued per second by flush threads.|
|**Log Blocks/sec**|Number of log blocks processed by controller per second.|
|**Missed Credit Slots**|Number of credit slots missed because of wait for credits from rate object.|
|**Stale Rate Object Waits/sec**|Number of waits due to stale rate objects (per second).|
|**Total Rate Objects Published**|Total number of Rate objects published.|
 
## Example

You begin to explore the query performance counters in this object using this T-SQL query on the [sys.dm_os_performance_counters](../system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-performance-counters-transact-sql.md) dynamic management view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters
WHERE object_name LIKE '%XTP IO Governor%';
