# Monitor Disk Usage
  [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses Microsoft Windows operating system input/output (I/O) calls to perform read and write operations on your disk. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] manages when and how disk I/O is performed, but the Windows operating system performs the underlying I/O operations. The I/O subsystem includes the system bus, disk controller cards, disks, tape drives, CD-ROM drive, and many other I/O devices. Disk I/O is frequently the cause of bottlenecks in a system.  
  
 Monitoring disk activity involves two areas of focus:  
  
-   Monitoring Disk I/O and Detecting Excess Paging  
  
-   Isolating Disk Activity That [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Creates
