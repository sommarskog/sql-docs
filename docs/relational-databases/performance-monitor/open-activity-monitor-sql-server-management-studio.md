# Open Activity Monitor in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

 Activity Monitor runs queries on the monitored instance to obtain information for the Activity Monitor display panes. When the refresh interval is set to less than 10 seconds, the time that is used to run these queries can affect server performance. We recommend that you [download and install the latest version of SSMS](../../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).  
  
  
##  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 To view actual activity, you must have VIEW SERVER STATE permission. To view the Data File I/O section of Activity Monitor, you must have CREATE DATABASE, ALTER ANY DATABASE, or VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission in addition to VIEW SERVER STATE.  
  
 To KILL a process, a user must be a member of the `sysadmin` or `processadmin` fixed server roles.

### Object Explorer

Right-click on the top-level object for a SQL Server connection, and select **Activity Monitor**.
