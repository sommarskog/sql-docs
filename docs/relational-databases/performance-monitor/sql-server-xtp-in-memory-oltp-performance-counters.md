# SQL Server XTP (In-Memory OLTP) Performance Counters
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides objects and counters that can be used by Performance Monitor to monitor In-Memory OLTP activity. The objects and counters are shared across all instances of a given version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on the machine, starting in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)].  
  
 In the past the object and counter names began with *XTP*, as in **XTP Cursors**. Now starting with [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)], the names are like the following pattern:  
  
-   **SQL Server** *\<version>* **XTP Cursors**  
  
 For *\<version>* the value is the SQL Server XTP version year, for example, 2017.  
  
##  <a name="SQLServerPOs"></a> SQL Server XTP Performance Objects  
 The following table describes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] performance objects.  
  
|Performance object|Description|  
|------------------------|-----------------|  
|[SQL Server XTP Cursors](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-xtp-cursors.md)|The SQL Server XTP Cursors performance object contains counters related to internal In-Memory OLTP engine cursors. Cursors are the low-level building blocks the In-Memory OLTP engine uses to process [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] queries. As such, you do not typically have direct control over them.|  
|[SQL Server XTP Databases](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-xtp-databases.md)|The SQL Server XTP Databases performance object provides In-Memory OLTP database-specific counters.|  
|[SQL Server XTP Garbage Collection](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-xtp-garbage-collection.md)|The SQL Server XTP Garbage Collection performance object contains counters related to the In-Memory OLTP engine's garbage collector.|  
|[SQL Server 2016 XTP IO Governor](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-xtp-io-governor.md)|The SQL Server XTP IO Governor performance object contains counters related to the In-Memory OLTP IO Rate Governor.|
|[SQL Server XTP Phantom Processor](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-xtp-phantom-processor.md)|The SQL Server XTP Phantom Processor performance object contains counters related to the In-Memory OLTP engine's phantom processing subsystem. This component is responsible for detecting phantom rows in transactions running at the SERIALIZABLE isolation level.|  
|[SQL Server XTP Storage](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-xtp-storage.md)|The SQL Server XTP Storage performance object contains counters related to In-Memory OLTP storage in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|  
|[SQL Server XTP Transaction Log](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-xtp-transaction-log.md)|The SQL Server XTP Transaction Log performance object contains counters related to In-Memory OLTP transaction logging in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|  
|[SQL Server XTP Transactions](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-xtp-transactions.md)|The SQL Server XTP Transactions performance object contains counters related to In-Memory OLTP engine transactions in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|
