# SQL Server XTP Transaction Log object
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  The **SQL Server XTP Transaction Log** performance object contains counters related to In-Memory OLTP transaction log activity in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 This table describes the **SQL Server XTP Transaction Log** counters.  
  
|Counter|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|**Log bytes written/sec**|The number of bytes written to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] transaction log by the In-Memory OLTP engine (on average), per second.|  
|**Log records written/sec**|The number of records written to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] transaction log by the In-Memory OLTP engine (on average), per second.|  
  
 
## Example

You begin to explore the query performance counters in this object using this T-SQL query on the [sys.dm_os_performance_counters](../system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-performance-counters-transact-sql.md) dynamic management view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters
WHERE object_name LIKE '%XTP Transaction Log%';
```
