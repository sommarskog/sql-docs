  The **SQLServer:Cursor Manager by Type** object provides counters to monitor cursors, grouped by type.  
  
 This table describes the SQL Server **Cursor Manager by Type** counters.  
  
|**Cursor Manager by Type** counters|Description|  
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**Active cursors**|Number of active cursors.|  
|**Cache Hit Ratio**|Ratio between cache hits and lookups.|  
|**Cache Hit Ratio Base**|For internal use only.| 
|**Cached Cursor Counts**|Number of cursors of a given type in the cache.|  
|**Cursor Cache Use Count/sec**|Times each type of cached cursor has been used.|  
|**Cursor memory usage**|Amount of memory consumed by cursors in kilobytes (KB).|  
|**Cursor Requests/sec**|Number of SQL cursor requests received by server.|  
|**Cursor worktable usage**|Number of worktables used by cursors.|  
|**Number of active cursor plans**|Number of cursor plans.|

## Example

You begin to explore the query performance counters in this object using this T-SQL query on the [sys.dm_os_performance_counters](../system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-performance-counters-transact-sql.md) dynamic management view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters
WHERE object_name LIKE '%Cursor Manager by Type%';
```
