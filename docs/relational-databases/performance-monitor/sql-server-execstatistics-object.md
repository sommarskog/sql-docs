 Each counter in the object contains the following instances:  
  
|Item|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|**Average execution time (ms)**|Average execution time of the selected type of execution.|  
|**Cumulative execution time (ms) per second**|Aggregated execution time per second, of the selected type of execution.|
