  This topic describes how to create a data quality project by using [!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../includes/ssdqsclient-md.md)]. A data quality project is used to run the cleansing or matching activity in [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversion](../includes/ssdqsnoversion-md.md)] (DQS).  
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites
