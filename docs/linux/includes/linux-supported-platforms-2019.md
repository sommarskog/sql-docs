<sup>1</sup> Support for SQL Server on Ubuntu 16.04 is limited. At the end of April 2021, Ubuntu 16.04 transitioned from its standard five-year maintenance window for long term support (LTS) releases, into extended security maintenance (ESM) support. For more details, see [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS transitions to Extended Security Maintenance (ESM) | Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-16-04-lts-transitions-to-extended-security-maintenance-esm).
