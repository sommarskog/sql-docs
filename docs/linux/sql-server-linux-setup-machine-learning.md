# Install SQL Server 2019 Machine Learning Services (Python and R) on Linux

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2019 - Linux](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019-linux.md)]

This article guides you in the installation of [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../machine-learning//sql-server-machine-learning-services.md) on Linux. Python and R scripts can be executed in-database using Machine Learning Services.

You can install Machine Learning Services on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), and Ubuntu. For more information, see [the Supported platforms section in the Installation guidance for SQL Server on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup.md#supportedplatforms).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These instructions are specific to [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)]. For [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)], where installation steps are different, refer to [Install SQL Server 2022 Machine Learning Services (Python and R) on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup-machine-learning-sql-2022.md).

## Pre-install checklist

* [Install SQL Server on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup.md) and verify the installation.

* Check the SQL Server Linux repositories for the Python and R extensions. 
  If you already configured source repositories for the database engine install, you can run the **mssql-mlservices** package install commands using the same repo registration.

* (R only) Microsoft R Open (MRO) provides the base R distribution for the R feature in SQL Server and is a prerequisite for using RevoScaleR, MicrosoftML, and other R packages installed with Machine Learning Services.
    * The required version is MRO 3.5.2.
    * Register the `packages.microsoft.com` repo as described below to install the MRO distribution: `microsoft-r-open-mro` and `microsoft-r-open-mkl`. 
    * See the installation sections below for how to install MRO.

* You should have a tool for running T-SQL commands. 

  * You can use [Azure Data Studio](../azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio.md), a free database tool that runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Package list

On an internet-connected device, packages are downloaded and installed independently of the database engine using the package installer for each operating system. The following table describes all available packages, but for R and Python, you specify packages that provide either the full feature installation or the minimum feature installation.

Available installation packages:

| Package name | Applies-to | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
|mssql-server-extensibility  | All | Extensibility framework used to run Python and R. |
| microsoft-openmpi  | Python, R | Message passing interface used by the Rev* libraries for parallelization on Linux. |
| mssql-mlservices-python | Python | Open-source distribution of Anaconda and Python. |
|mssql-mlservices-mlm-py  | Python | *Full install*. Provides revoscalepy, microsoftml, pre-trained models for image featurization and text sentiment analysis.| 
|mssql-mlservices-packages-py  | Python | *Minimum install*. Provides revoscalepy and microsoftml. <br/>Excludes pre-trained models. | 
| [microsoft-r-open*](#mro) | R | Open-source distribution of R, composed of three packages. |
|mssql-mlservices-mlm-r  | R | *Full install*. Provides: RevoScaleR, MicrosoftML, sqlRUtils, olapR, pre-trained models for image featurization and text sentiment analysis.| 
|mssql-mlservices-packages-r  | R | *Minimum install*. Provides RevoScaleR, sqlRUtils, MicrosoftML, olapR. <br/>Excludes pre-trained models. |

sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc

# Set the location of the package repo at the "prod" directory
# The following command is for version 8.x
# To get the version for 6.x or 7.x, replace 8 with 6 or 7, respectively.
rpm -Uvh https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/8/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm

# Update packages on your system (optional)
yum update
```

Installation Options for Python and R:

```

## Post-install config (required)

Additional configuration is primarily through the [mssql-conf tool](sql-server-linux-configure-mssql-conf.md).

1. After the package installation finishes, run mssql-conf setup and follow the prompts to set the SA password and choose your edition. Perform this step only if you have not configured SQL Server on Linux yet. 

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
   ```

2. Accept the licensing agreements for open-source Python and R extensions. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   # Run as SUDO or root
   # Use set + EULA 
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set EULA accepteulaml Y
   ```
   Setup detects the mssql-mlservices packages and prompts for EULA acceptance (if not previously accepted) when `mssql-conf setup` is run. For more information about EULA parameters, see [Configure SQL Server with the mssql-conf tool](sql-server-linux-configure-mssql-conf.md#mlservices-eula).

3. Enable outbound network access. Outbound network access is disabled by default. To enable outbound requests, set the "outboundnetworkaccess" Boolean property using the mssql-conf tool. For more information, see [Configure SQL Server on Linux with mssql-conf](sql-server-linux-configure-mssql-conf.md#mlservices-outbound-access).

   ```bash
   # Run as SUDO or root
   # Enable outbound requests over the network
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set extensibility outboundnetworkaccess 1
   ```

4. For R feature integration only, set the **MKL_CBWR** environment variable to [ensure consistent output](https://software.intel.com/articles/introduction-to-the-conditional-numerical-reproducibility-cnr) from Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) calculations.

   + Edit or create a file `.bash_profile` in your user home directory, adding the line `export MKL_CBWR="AUTO"` to the file.

   + Execute this file by typing `source .bash_profile` at a bash command prompt.

5. Restart the SQL Server Launchpad service and the database engine instance to read the updated values from the INI file. A notification message is displayed when an extensibility-related setting is modified.  

   ```bash
   systemctl restart mssql-launchpadd

   systemctl restart mssql-server.service
   ```

6. Enable external script execution using Azure Data Studio or another tool like SQL Server Management Studio (Windows only) that runs Transact-SQL.

   ```sql
   EXEC sp_configure 'external scripts enabled', 1 
   RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE 
   ```

7. Restart the Launchpad service again.

## Verify installation

R libraries (MicrosoftML, RevoScaleR, and others) can be found at `/opt/mssql/mlservices/libraries/RServer`.

Python libraries (microsoftml and revoscalepy) can be found at `/opt/mssql/mlservices/libraries/PythonServer`.

To validate installation:

* Run a T-SQL script that executes a system stored procedure invoking Python or R using a query tool. 

* Execute the following SQL command to test R execution in SQL Server. Errors? Try a service restart, `sudo systemctl restart mssql-server.service`.
  ```sql
  EXEC sp_execute_external_script   
  @language =N'R', 
  @script=N' 
  OutputDataSet <- InputDataSet', 
  @input_data_1 =N'SELECT 1 AS hello' 
  WITH RESULT SETS (([hello] int not null)); 
  GO 
  ```
 
* Execute the following SQL command to test Python execution in SQL Server. 
 
  ```sql
  EXEC sp_execute_external_script  
  @language =N'Python', 
  @script=N' 
  OutputDataSet = InputDataSet; 
  ', 
  @input_data_1 =N'SELECT 1 AS hello' 
  WITH RESULT SETS (([hello] int not null)); 
  GO 
  ```

## Unattended installation

Using the [unattended install](sql-server-linux-setup.md#unattended) for the Database Engine, add the packages for mssql-mlservices and EULAs.

 Use one of the mlservices-specific EULA parameters for the open-source R and Python distributions:

```bash
sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup accept-eula-ml
```

The complete EULA is documented at [Configure SQL Server on Linux with the mssql-conf tool](sql-server-linux-configure-mssql-conf.md#mlservices-eula).

## Offline installation

Follow the [Offline installation](sql-server-linux-setup.md#offline) instructions for steps on installing the packages. Find your download site, and then download specific packages using the package list below.

> [!Tip]
> Several of the package management tools provide commands that can help you determine package dependencies. For yum, use `sudo yum deplist [package]`. For Ubuntu, use `sudo apt-get install --reinstall --download-only [package name]` followed by `dpkg -I [package name].deb`.

 
### Download site

Download packages from [https://packages.microsoft.com/](https://packages.microsoft.com/). All of the mlservices packages for Python and R are colocated with database engine package. Base version for the mlservices packages is 9.4.6. Recall that the microsoft-r-open packages are in a [different repository](#mro).
