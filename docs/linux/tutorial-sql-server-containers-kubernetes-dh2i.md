# Deploy availability groups with DH2i DxEnterprise on Kubernetes

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Linux](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-linux.md)]

This tutorial explains how to configure SQL Server Always On availability groups for SQL Server Linux based containers deployed to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Kubernetes cluster, using DH2i DxEnterprise. You can choose between a [sidecar configuration](/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar) (preferred), or build your own custom container image.

# [Sidecar configuration](#tab/sidecar)

Using the steps mentioned in this article, learn how to deploy a StatefulSet and use the DH2i DxEnterprise solution to create and configure an availability group (AG). This tutorial consists of the following steps:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create a headless service configuration
> - Create a StatefulSet configuration with SQL Server and DxEnterprise in the same pod as a sidecar container
> - Create and configure a [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] AG, adding the secondary replicas
> - Create a database in the AG, and test failover

## Prerequisites

This tutorial shows an example of an AG with three replicas. You need:

- An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Kubernetes cluster.
- A valid DxEnterprise license with AG features and tunnels enabled. For more information, see the [developer edition](https://dh2i.com/trial/) for nonproduction usage, or [DxEnterprise software](https://dh2i.com/dxenterprise-high-availability/) for production workloads.

## Create the headless service

1. In a Kubernetes cluster, headless services allow your pods to connect to one another using hostnames.

   To create the headless service, Create a YAML file called `headless_services.yaml`, with the following sample content:

   ```yaml
   #Headless services for local connections/resolution
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
   name: dxemssql-0
   spec:
   clusterIP: None
   selector:
       statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name: dxemssql-0
   ports:
   - name: dxl
       protocol: TCP
       port: 7979
   - name: dxc-tcp
       protocol: TCP
       port: 7980
   - name: dxc-udp
       protocol: UDP
       port: 7981
   - name: sql
       protocol: TCP
       port: 1433
   - name: listener
       protocol: TCP
       port: 14033
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
   name: dxemssql-1
   spec:
   clusterIP: None
   selector:
       statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name: dxemssql-1
   ports:
   - name: dxl
       protocol: TCP
       port: 7979
   - name: dxc-tcp
       protocol: TCP
       port: 7980
   - name: dxc-udp
       protocol: UDP
       port: 7981
   - name: sql
       protocol: TCP
       port: 1433
   - name: listener
       protocol: TCP
       port: 14033
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
   name: dxemssql-2
   spec:
   clusterIP: None
   selector:
       statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name: dxemssql-2
   ports:
   - name: dxl
       protocol: TCP
       port: 7979
   - name: dxc-tcp
       protocol: TCP
       port: 7980
   - name: dxc-udp
       protocol: UDP
       port: 7981
   - name: sql
       protocol: TCP
       port: 1433
   - name: listener
       protocol: TCP
       port: 14033
   ```

1. Run the following command to apply the configuration:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f headless_services.yaml
   ```

## Create the StatefulSet

1. Create a StatefulSet YAML file with following sample content, and name it `dxemssql.yaml`.

   This StatefulSet configuration creates three DxEMSSQL replicas that utilize persistent volume claims to store their data. Each pod in this StatefulSet comprises two containers: a [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] container and a DxEnterprise container. These containers are started separately from one another in a "sidecar" configuration, but DxEnterprise manages the AG replica in the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] container.

   ```yaml
   #DxEnterprise + MSSQL StatefulSet
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: StatefulSet
   metadata:
   name: dxemssql
   spec:
   serviceName: "dxemssql"
   replicas: 3
   selector:
       matchLabels:
       app: dxemssql
   template:
       metadata:
       labels:
           app: dxemssql
       spec:
       securityContext:
           fsGroup: 10001
       containers:
       - name: sql
           image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
           env:
           - name: ACCEPT_EULA
           value: "Y"
           - name: MSSQL_ENABLE_HADR
           value: "1"
           - name: MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD
           valueFrom:
               secretKeyRef:
               name: mssql
               key: MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD
           volumeMounts:
           - name: mssql
           mountPath: "/var/opt/mssql"
       - name: dxe
           image: dh2i/dxe
           env:
           - name: MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD
           valueFrom:
               secretKeyRef:
               name: mssql
               key: MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD
           volumeMounts:
           - name: dxe
           mountPath: "/etc/dh2i"
   volumeClaimTemplates:
   - metadata:
       name: dxe
       spec:
       accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
       resources:
           requests:
           storage: 1Gi
   - metadata:
       name: mssql
       spec:
       accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
       resources:
           requests:
           storage: 1Gi
   ```

1. Create a credential for the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic mssql --from-literal=MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD="<password>"
   ```

1. Apply the StatefulSet configuration:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f dxemssql.yaml
   ```

1. Verify the status of the pods, and proceed to the next step when the pod's status becomes `running`:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl describe pods
   ```

## Create availability group and test failover

For details on creating and configuring AG, adding replicas and testing failover, refer to [SQL Server Availability Groups in Kubernetes](http://support.dh2i.com/docs/guides/dxenterprise/containers/kubernetes/mssql-ag-k8s-statefulset-qsg/#create-the-availability-group).

# [Custom image](#tab/custom)

In this tutorial, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is used as the Kubernetes cluster and the tutorial consists of the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Deploy Azure Kubernetes Service
> - Prepare the SQL Server and DH2i custom container image
> - Deploy containers on Azure Kubernetes Service
> - Configure the DxEnterprise cluster
> - Configure `Read_Write_Routing_URL` for listener functionality (optional)

For more information about DxEnterprise, see [DH2i DxEnterprise](https://dh2i.com/dxenterprise-high-availability/).

> [!NOTE]  
> Microsoft supports data movement, availability group, and SQL Server components. DH2i is responsible for support of the DxEnterprise product, which includes cluster and quorum management.

## Prerequisites

- To deploy Azure Kubernetes Service, you must have an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). A two-node cluster is a good starting point for this tutorial.
- Create [Azure Container Registry](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal). This registry is used in our deployment scripts to retrieve the custom image and deploy the containers to Azure Kubernetes. Instead of Azure Container Registry (ACR), you could use your preferred container registry to push the custom container images.

## Deploy Azure Kubernetes Service

Follow this [quickstart tutorial](/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal#create-an-aks-cluster) to set up a two-node Kubernetes cluster using the Azure Kubernetes Service. After you've created the cluster, you can connect to it by following the steps outlined in the [Connect to the cluster](/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal#connect-to-the-cluster) section.

You should now have a two-node Kubernetes cluster. Running `kubectl get nodes` from your client machine using a console app should yield results similar to the following:

```bash
C:\>kubectl get nodes
NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE   VERSION
aks-nodepool1-75119571-vmss000000   Ready    agent   61d   v1.19.9
aks-nodepool1-75119571-vmss000001   Ready    agent   61d   v1.19.9
```

## Prepare the SQL Server and DH2i DxEnterprise custom container image

Create the custom container image that will be used in our deployment manifests. The custom container image deploys SQL Server, .NET, and DxEnterprise in a container. The deployment sample dockerfile is provided below. You can modify it to meet your needs, such as changing the SQL Server version.

For more information on Docker and using Dockerfiles, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

```bash
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
USER root

#Install dotnet
RUN apt-get update \
   && ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get upgrade -y \
   && apt-get install -y wget \
   && wget --no-dns-cache https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb \
   && dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb \
   && apt-get update \
   && apt-get install -y dotnet-runtime-6.0 zip \
   && dpkg --purge packages-microsoft-prod \
   && apt-get purge -y wget \
   && apt-get clean \
   && rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb \
   && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

#Download and unpack DxE, setup permissions
ADD https://repos.dh2i.com/container/ ./dxe.tgz
RUN tar zxvf dxe.tgz && rm dxe.tgz \
   && chown -R mssql /var/opt/mssql \
   && chmod -R 777 /opt/dh2i /etc/dh2i

#Finish setup
EXPOSE 7979 7985
ENV DX_HAS_MSSQLSERVER=1
USER mssql
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/dh2i/sbin/dxstart.sh"]
```

On a Linux machine, run the following commands to build the image:

```bash
$mkdir dockerfiles
$cd dockerfiles
$nano Dockerfile
# paste the sample dockerfile content shared above
# now build the image using the command:
# <tagname> should be sqldh2i/latest
$docker build -t <tagname> .
# you should now be able to see the new image, sqldh2i when you run the docker images command
```

Tag the image and push it to Azure Container Registry (ACR) using the following commands. Make sure you've already logged into Azure Container Registry (ACR) using the `docker login` command. For more information, see [login to ACR](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal#log-in-to-registry).

```bash
$docker tag sqldh2i/latest <registry-name>.azurecr.io/sqldh2i:latest
#now push to the ACR repo:
$docker push <registry-name>.azurecr.io/sqldh2i:latest
#you can browse your ACR through the portal and should see the repo and the tag listed in the ACR.
```

This ensures that the custom image has been pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR) and that you can now integrate your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with ACR by running the following command. For more information, see this [Integrate ACR with an AKS cluster](/azure/aks/cluster-container-registry-integration).

Use the short name for `<registry-name>`. The full qualified name of the registry isn't accepted in the below command.

```bash
az aks update -n myAKSCluster -g <myResourceGroup> --attach-acr <registry-name>
```

## Deploy containers on Azure Kubernetes Service

This process deploys SQL Server containers as StatefulSet deployments; a sample deployment file that deploys the containers on the Azure Kubernetes Service is provided later in this article for reference.

1. Set up three SQL Server instances: one as a primary replica, and two as secondary replicas. You can optionally add labels to the node to ensure that the primary replica always runs on one node and the secondary replicas run on another. The following are the steps for labeling the nodes:

    1. Get the node names of the cluster using the command:

       ```bash
       kubectl get nodes
       ```

    1. Label the nodes using the following commands:

       ```bash
       kubectl label node aks-nodepool1-75119571-vmss000000 <role=ags-primary>
       ```

       ```bash
       kubectl label node aks-nodepool1-75119571-vmss000001 <role=ags-secondary>
       ```

1. Create the SA password secret on Kubernetes before deploying the SQL Server containers using the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic mssql --from-literal=MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD="MyC0m9l&xP@ssw0rd"
    ```

    Replace `MyC0m9l&xP@ssw0rd` with your own complex password.

1. Create a manifest (a YAML file) to describe the deployment. The following example shows our current deployment, which makes use of the custom container image created in the preceding steps.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This example needs to be modified to fit your environment, such as replacing port, image, and storage details.

    ```yaml

        targetPort: 7979
    ```

    Copy the preceding code into a new file called `sqldeployment.yaml`.

    Create the deployment using the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f <Path to sqldeployment.yaml file>
    ```

    Once the deployment completes, run the `kubectl get all` command. You should see the following results:

    ```output
    C:\>kubectl get all

    statefulset.apps/mssql-sec   2/2     33h
    ```

As you can see, we have three SQL Server instances, each with its own storage and services exposing ports 1433 (SQL) and 7979 (DxEnterprise Cluster). You can connect to each SQL Server instance using the External-IP address. The SA PASSWORD is the same password you provided when creating the mssql secret in the preceding steps.

## Configure the DxEnterprise cluster on the deployed containers

DxEnterprise is high availability clustering software from DH2i that supports SQL Server availability groups, including in containers. A fully featured [developer](https://dh2i.com/dxenterprise-dxodyssey-developer-edition) edition is available for non-production use. To configure the DxEnterprise cluster in containers, follow the steps in this [DH2i guide](https://support.dh2i.com/docs/guides/dxenterprise/azure/ms-k8s-supplemental-guide/#configure-the-primary-and-create-the-availability-group).

With this, you should have an Always On availability group created and database(s) added to the group supporting high availability.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can deploy [basic Always On availability group](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/basic-availability-groups-always-on-availability-groups.md) with SQL Server standard edition, but as you may be aware, one of the limitations of basic availability groups is that you are limited to only having two replicas and one additional configuration only replica required for successful automatic failover. Refer to the [documentation](./sql-server-linux-availability-group-overview.md#configuration-only-replica-and-quorum) for more information on failover with configuration only replica. You can add configuration only replica for containers as well, and to do so, please refer to the [DH2i documentation](https://support.dh2i.com/docs/guides/dxenterprise/azure/ms-k8s-supplemental-guide/#configure-the-primary-and-create-the-availability-group), making sure to pass the availability mode in the 'dxcli add-ags-node' command as 'configuration_only'.

## Steps to configure availability group listener (optional)

You can also configure an availability group listener, with the following steps:

1. Ensure you've created the AG listener using DxEnterprise as outlined in the optional step near the end of the [DH2i documentation](https://support.dh2i.com/docs/guides/dxenterprise/azure/ms-k8s-supplemental-guide/#add-availability-group-databases-and-a-listener).

1. In Kubernetes, you can optionally create static IP addresses. Creating static IP addresses ensures that if the listener service is deleted and recreated, the external IP address assigned to your listener service doesn't change and thus remains static. Follow the steps outlined [here](/azure/aks/static-ip#create-a-static-ip-address) to create a static IP address in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

1. After you have created an IP address, you assign that IP address and create the load balancer service, as shown in the following YAML sample:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: agslistener
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     loadBalancerIP: 52.140.117.62
     selector:
       app: mssql
     ports:
     - protocol: TCP
       port: 44444
       targetPort: 44444
   ```

## Steps to configure read/write connection redirection (optional)

After you've created the availability group, you can enable read/write connection redirection from the secondary to primary by following these steps. For more information, see [Secondary to primary replica read/write connection redirection](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/secondary-replica-connection-redirection-always-on-availability-groups.md).

```sql
USE [master];
GO

ALTER AVAILABILITY
GROUP [ag_name] MODIFY REPLICA
    ON N'<name of the primary replica>'
WITH (SECONDARY_ROLE(ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL));
GO

USE [master];
GO

ALTER AVAILABILITY
GROUP [AGS1] MODIFY REPLICA
    ON N'<name of the secondary-0 replica>'
WITH (SECONDARY_ROLE(ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL));
GO

USE [master];
GO

ALTER AVAILABILITY
GROUP [AGS1] MODIFY REPLICA
    ON N'<name of the secondary-1 replica>'
WITH (SECONDARY_ROLE(ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL));
GO

USE [master];
GO

ALTER AVAILABILITY
GROUP AGS1 MODIFY REPLICA
    ON N'<name of the primary replica>'
WITH (PRIMARY_ROLE(READ_WRITE_ROUTING_URL = 'TCP://<External IP address of primary -0>:1433'));
GO

USE [master];
GO

ALTER AVAILABILITY
GROUP AGS1 MODIFY REPLICA
    ON N'<name of the secondary-0 replica>'
WITH (PRIMARY_ROLE(READ_WRITE_ROUTING_URL = 'TCP://<External IP address of secondary -0>:1433'));
GO

USE [master];
GO

ALTER AVAILABILITY
GROUP AGS1 MODIFY REPLICA
    ON N'<name of the secondary-1 replica>'
WITH (PRIMARY_ROLE(READ_WRITE_ROUTING_URL = 'TCP://<External IP address of secondary -1>:1433'));
GO
```
