# Configure SQL Server Always On availability group on Windows and Linux (cross-platform)

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-sslinux-only](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2017.md)]

This article explains the steps to create an Always On availability group (AG) with one replica on a Windows server and the other replica on a Linux server.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cross-platform availability groups, which include heterogeneous replicas with complete high-availability and disaster recovery support, is available with DH2i DxEnterprise. For more information, see [SQL Server Availability Groups with Mixed Operating Systems](https://support.dh2i.com/docs/guides/dxenterprise/sql_server/mssql-ag-mixed-os-qsg).

This configuration is cross-platform because the replicas are on different operating systems. Use this configuration for migration from one platform to the other or disaster recovery (DR). This configuration doesn't support high availability.

Before proceeding, you should be familiar with installation and configuration for SQL Server instances on Windows and Linux.

## Scenario

In this scenario, two servers are on different operating systems. A Windows Server 2022 named `WinSQLInstance` hosts the primary replica. A Linux server named `LinuxSQLInstance` host the secondary replica.

## Configure the AG

The steps to create the AG are the same as the steps to create an AG for [read-scale workloads](sql-server-linux-availability-group-configure-rs.md). The AG cluster type is NONE, because there is no cluster manager.

> [!NOTE]  
> For the scripts in this article, angle brackets `<` and `>` identify values that you need to replace for your environment. The angle brackets themselves are not required for the scripts.

1. Install [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] on Windows Server 2022, enable **Always On Availability Groups** from SQL Server Configuration Manager, and set mixed mode authentication.

   > [!TIP]  
   > If you are validating this solution in Azure, place both servers in the same availability set to ensure they are separated in the data center.

   **Enable Availability Groups**

   For instructions, see [Enable and disable Always On Availability Groups (SQL Server)](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/enable-and-disable-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server.md).

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sql-server-linux-availability-group-cross-platform/configuration-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to enable Availability Groups.":::

   SQL Server Configuration Manager notes that the computer isn't a node in a failover cluster.

   After you enable Availability Groups, restart SQL Server.

   **Set mixed mode authentication**

   For instructions, see [Change server authentication mode](../database-engine/configure-windows/change-server-authentication-mode.md#change-authentication-mode-with-ssms).

1. Install [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] on Linux. For instructions, see [Install SQL Server](sql-server-linux-setup.md). Enable `hadr` with **mssql-conf**.

   To enable `hadr` via **mssql-conf** from a shell prompt, issue the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set hadr.hadrenabled 1
   ```

   After you enable `hadr`, restart the SQL Server instance:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mssql-server.service
   ```

1. Configure the `hosts` file on both servers, or register the server names with DNS.

1. Open up firewall ports for TCP 1433 and 5022 on both Windows and Linux.

1. On the primary replica, create a database login and password.

   ```sql
   CREATE LOGIN dbm_login WITH PASSWORD = '<C0m9L3xP@55w0rd!>';
   CREATE USER dbm_user FOR LOGIN dbm_login;
   GO
   ```

1. On the primary replica, create a master key and certificate, then back up the certificate with a private key.

   ```sql
   CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '<C0m9L3xP@55w0rd!>';
   CREATE CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate WITH SUBJECT = 'dbm';
   BACKUP CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate
   TO FILE = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\dbm_certificate.cer'
   WITH PRIVATE KEY (
           FILE = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\dbm_certificate.pvk',
           ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '<C0m9L3xP@55w0rd!>'
       );
   GO
   ```

1. Copy the certificate and private key to the Linux server (secondary replica) at `/var/opt/mssql/data`. You can use `pscp` to copy the files to the Linux server.

1. Set the group and ownership of the private key and the certificate to `mssql:mssql`.

   The following script sets the group and ownership of the files.

   ```bash
   sudo chown mssql:mssql /var/opt/mssql/data/dbm_certificate.pvk
   sudo chown mssql:mssql /var/opt/mssql/data/dbm_certificate.cer
   ```

   In the following diagram, ownership and group are set correctly for the certificate and key.

1. On the secondary replica, create a database login and password and create a master key.

   ```sql
   CREATE LOGIN dbm_login WITH PASSWORD = '<C0m9L3xP@55w0rd!>';
   CREATE USER dbm_user FOR LOGIN dbm_login;
   GO
   CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '<M@st3rKeyP@55w0rD!>'
   GO
   ```

1. On the secondary replica, restore the certificate you copied to `/var/opt/mssql/data`.

   ```sql
   CREATE CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate
       AUTHORIZATION dbm_user
       FROM FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/dbm_certificate.cer'
       WITH PRIVATE KEY (
       FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/dbm_certificate.pvk',
       DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '<C0m9L3xP@55w0rd!>'
   )
   GO
   ```

1. On the primary replica, create an endpoint.

   ```sql
   CREATE ENDPOINT [Hadr_endpoint]
       AS TCP (LISTENER_IP = (0.0.0.0), LISTENER_PORT = 5022)
       FOR DATA_MIRRORING (
           ROLE = ALL,
           AUTHENTICATION = CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate,
           ENCRYPTION = REQUIRED ALGORITHM AES
           );
   ALTER ENDPOINT [Hadr_endpoint] STATE = STARTED;
   GRANT CONNECT ON ENDPOINT::[Hadr_endpoint] TO [dbm_login];
   GO
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > The firewall must be open for the listener TCP port. In the preceding script, the port is 5022. Use any available TCP port.

1. On the secondary replica, create the endpoint. Repeat the preceding script on the secondary replica to create the endpoint.

1. On the primary replica, create the AG with `CLUSTER_TYPE = NONE`. The example script uses `SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC` to create the AG.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > When the Windows instance of SQL Server uses different paths for data and log files, automatic seeding fails to the Linux instance of SQL Server, because these paths do not exist on the secondary replica. To use the following script for a cross-platform AG, the database requires the same path for the data and log files on the Windows server. Alternatively you can update the script to set `SEEDING_MODE = MANUAL` and then back up and restore the database with `NORECOVERY` to seed the database.  
   >
   > This behavior applies to Azure Marketplace images.
   >
   > For more information about automatic seeding, see [Automatic Seeding - Disk Layout](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/automatic-seeding-secondary-replicas.md#disklayout).

   Before you run the script, update the values for your AGs.

      - Replace `<WinSQLInstance>` with the server name of the primary replica SQL Server instance.

      - Replace `<LinuxSQLInstance>` with the server name of the secondary replica SQL Server instance.

   To create the AG, update the values and run the script on the primary replica.

   ```sql
   CREATE AVAILABILITY
   GROUP [ag1]
   WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = NONE)
   FOR REPLICA
       ON N'<WinSQLInstance>'
   WITH (
       ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://<WinSQLInstance>:5022',
       AVAILABILITY_MODE = ASYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
       SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC,
       FAILOVER_MODE = MANUAL,
       SECONDARY_ROLE(ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL)
       ),
       N'<LinuxSQLInstance>'
   WITH (
       ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://<LinuxSQLInstance>:5022',
       AVAILABILITY_MODE = ASYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
       SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC,
       FAILOVER_MODE = MANUAL,
       SECONDARY_ROLE(ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL);
       )
   GO
   ```

   For more information, see [CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP (Transact-SQL)](../t-sql/statements/create-availability-group-transact-sql.md).

1. On the secondary replica, join the AG.

   ```sql
   ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] JOIN WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = NONE);
   ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
   GO
   ```

1. Create a database for the AG. The example steps use a database named `TestDB`. If you are using automatic seeding, set the same path for both the data and the log files.

   Before you run the script, update the values for your database.

   - Replace `TestDB` with the name of your database.

   - Replace `<F:\Path>` with the path for your database and log files. Use the same path for the database and log files.

   You can also use the default paths.

   To create your database, run the script.

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE [TestDB]
      CONTAINMENT = NONE
     ON  PRIMARY ( NAME = N'TestDB', FILENAME = N'<F:\Path>\TestDB.mdf')
     LOG ON ( NAME = N'TestDB_log', FILENAME = N'<F:\Path>\TestDB_log.ldf');
   GO
   ```

1. Take a full backup of the database.

1. If you aren't using automatic seeding, restore the database on the secondary replica (Linux) server. [Migrate a SQL Server database from Windows to Linux using backup and restore](sql-server-linux-migrate-restore-database.md). Restore the database `WITH NORECOVERY` on the secondary replica.

1. Add the database to the AG. Update the example script. Replace `TestDB` with the name of your database. On the primary replica, run the T-SQL query to add the database to the AG.

   ```sql
   ALTER AG [ag1] ADD DATABASE TestDB;
   GO
   ```

1. Verify that the database is getting populated on the secondary replica.

## Fail over the primary replica

[!INCLUDE[Force failover](../includes/ss-force-failover-read-scale-out.md)]

This article reviewed the steps to create a cross-platform AG to support migration or read-scale workloads. It can be used for manual disaster recovery. It also explained how to fail over the AG. A cross-platform AG uses cluster type `NONE` and doesn't support high availability.
