# Automate database migration to Linux with the SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Linux](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-linux.md)]

This article introduces [SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA)](../ssma/sql-server-migration-assistant.md) that helps you easily migrate databases to SQL Server on Linux from Microsoft Access, DB2, MySQL, Oracle, and Sybase. SSMA is a Windows application, so use SSMA when you have a Windows machine that can connect to a remote SQL Server instance on Linux. 

SSMA supports a variety of source databases including Oracle, MySQL, Sybase, DB2, and Microsoft Access to SQL Server on Linux and helps automate migration tasks such as:

- Assess your source database
- Convert the source database schema to Microsoft SQL Server schema
- Migrate the schema
- Migrate the data
- Test the migration

To get started, download SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for your source database from the following list:
- [SSMA for Access](https://aka.ms/ssmaforaccess)
- [SSMA for DB2](https://aka.ms/ssmafordb2)
- [SSMA for MySQL](https://aka.ms/ssmaformysql)Â 
- [SSMA for Oracle](https://aka.ms/ssmafororacle)
- [SSMA for Sybase ASE](https://aka.ms/ssmaforsybase)
