This image consists of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] running on Linux based on Ubuntu 20.04. It can be used with the Docker Engine 1.8+ on Linux.

The examples in this article use the `docker` command. However, most of these commands also work with Podman. Podman provides a command-line interface similar to the Docker Engine. You can [find out more about Podman](http://docs.podman.io/en/latest).

## <a id="requirements"></a> Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 1.8+ on any supported Linux distribution. For more information, see [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
- For more information on hardware requirements and processor support, see:
  - [SQL Server 2016 and 2017: Hardware and software requirements](../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md)
  - [SQL Server 2019: Hardware and software requirements](../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server-2019.md)

- Docker `overlay2` storage driver. This driver is the default for most users. If you aren't using this storage provider and need to change, see the instructions and warnings in the [Docker documentation for configuring overlay2](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/#configure-docker-with-the-overlay-or-overlay2-storage-driver).

- At least 2 GB of disk space.

- At least 2 GB of RAM.

## <a id="pullandrun2017"></a> Pull and run the SQL Server Linux container image

Before starting the following steps, make sure that you've selected your preferred shell (**bash**, **PowerShell**, or **cmd**) at the top of this article.

1. Pull the [!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)] Linux container image from the Microsoft Container Registry.

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-bash"

   ```bash
   sudo docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-powershell"

   ```PowerShell
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-cmd"

   ```cmd
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   > [!TIP]  
   > This quickstart creates [!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)] containers. If you prefer to create Linux containers for different versions of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see the [[!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)]](quickstart-install-connect-docker.md?view=sql-server-linux-ver15&preserve-view=true#pullandrun2019) or [[!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)]](quickstart-install-connect-docker.md?view=sql-server-linux-ver16&preserve-view=true#pullandrun2022) versions of this article.

   The previous command pulls the latest [!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)] Linux container image. If you want to pull a specific image, you add a colon and the tag name, such as `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-GA-ubuntu`. To see all available images, see [the mssql-server Docker hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server).

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-bash"
   For the bash commands in this article, `sudo` is used. If you don't want to use `sudo` to run Docker, you can configure a `docker` group and add users to that group. For more information, see [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).

   ::: zone-end

1. To run the Linux container image with Docker, you can use the following command from a bash shell or elevated PowerShell command prompt.

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > The `SA_PASSWORD` environment variable is deprecated. Use `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` instead.

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-bash"

   ```bash
   sudo docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=<YourStrong@Passw0rd>" \
      -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 --hostname sql1 \
      -d \
      mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-powershell"

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If you are using PowerShell Core, replace the double quotes with single quotes.

   ```PowerShell
   docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=<YourStrong@Passw0rd>" `
      -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 --hostname sql1 `
      -d `
      mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-cmd"

   ```cmd
   docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=<YourStrong@Passw0rd>" `
      -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 --hostname sql1 `
      -d `
      mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   Your password should follow the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] default password policy, otherwise the container can't set up [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and will stop working. By default, the password must be at least eight characters long and contain characters from three of the following four sets: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, base-10 digits, and symbols. You can examine the error log by using the [`docker logs`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/) command.

   By default, this quickstart creates a container with the Developer edition of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The process for running production editions in containers is slightly different. For more information, see [Run production container images](./sql-server-linux-docker-container-deployment.md#production).

   The following table provides a description of the parameters in the previous `docker run` example:

   | Parameter | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | **-e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y"** | Set the `ACCEPT_EULA` variable to any value to confirm your acceptance of the End-User Licensing Agreement. Required setting for the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] image. |
   | **-e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=\<YourStrong@Passw0rd\>"** | Specify your own strong password that is at least eight characters and meets the [SQL Server password requirements](../relational-databases/security/password-policy.md). Required setting for the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] image. |
   | **-e "MSSQL_COLLATION=\<*SQL_Server_collation*\>"** | Specify a custom SQL Server collation, instead of the default `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS`. |
   | **-p 1433:1433** | Map a TCP port on the host environment (first value) with a TCP port in the container (second value). In this example, [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is listening on TCP 1433 in the container and this container port is then exposed to TCP port 1433 on the host. |
   | **--name sql1** | Specify a custom name for the container rather than a randomly generated one. If you run more than one container, you can't reuse this same name. |
   | **--hostname sql1** | Used to explicitly set the container hostname. If you don't specify the hostname, it defaults to the container ID, which is a randomly generated system GUID. |
   | **-d** | Run the container in the background (daemon). |
   | **mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest** | The [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Linux container image. |

1. To view your Docker containers, use the `docker ps` command.

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-bash"

   ```bash
   sudo docker ps -a
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-powershell"

   ```PowerShell
   docker ps -a
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-cmd"

   ```cmd
   docker ps -a
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   You should see output similar to the following:

   ```output
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                        COMMAND                    CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
   d4a1999ef83e   mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest   "/opt/mssql/bin/perm..."   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:1433->1433/tcp, :::1433->1433/tcp   sql1
   ```

1. If the `STATUS` column shows a status of `Up`, then [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running in the container and listening on the port specified in the `PORTS` column. If the `STATUS` column for your [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] container shows `Exited`, see the [Troubleshooting section of the configuration guide](./sql-server-linux-docker-container-troubleshooting.md). The server is ready for connections once the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error logs display the message: `SQL Server is now ready for client connections. This is an informational message; no user action is required`. You can review the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error log inside the container using the command:

   ```bash
   docker exec -t sql1 cat /var/opt/mssql/log/errorlog | grep connection
   ```

   The `--hostname` parameter, as discussed above, changes the internal name of the container to a custom value. This value is the name you'll see returned in the following Transact-SQL query:

   ```sql
   SELECT @@SERVERNAME,
       SERVERPROPERTY('ComputerNamePhysicalNetBIOS'),
       SERVERPROPERTY('MachineName'),
       SERVERPROPERTY('ServerName');
   ```

   Setting `--hostname` and `--name` to the same value is a good way to easily identify the target container.

1. As a final step, change your SA password because the `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` is visible in `ps -eax` output and stored in the environment variable of the same name. See steps below.

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > The `SA_PASSWORD` environment variable is deprecated. Use `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` instead.

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-bash"

   ```bash
   sudo docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=<YourStrong@Passw0rd>" \
      -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 --hostname sql1 \
      -d \
      mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-powershell"

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If you are using PowerShell Core, replace the double quotes with single quotes.

   ```PowerShell
   docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=<YourStrong@Passw0rd>" `
      -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 --hostname sql1 `
      -d `
      mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-cmd"

   ```cmd
   docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=<YourStrong@Passw0rd>" `
      -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 --hostname sql1 `
      -d `
      mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   Your password should follow the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] default password policy, otherwise the container can't set up [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and will stop working. By default, the password must be at least eight characters long and contain characters from three of the following four sets: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, base-10 digits, and symbols. You can examine the error log by using the [`docker logs`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/) command.

   By default, this quickstart creates a container with the Developer edition of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The process for running production editions in containers is slightly different. For more information, see [Run production container images](./sql-server-linux-docker-container-deployment.md#production).

   The following table provides a description of the parameters in the previous `docker run` example:

   | Parameter | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | **-e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y"** | Set the `ACCEPT_EULA` variable to any value to confirm your acceptance of the End-User Licensing Agreement. Required setting for the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] image. |
   | **-e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=\<YourStrong@Passw0rd\>"** | Specify your own strong password that is at least eight characters and meets the [SQL Server password requirements](../relational-databases/security/password-policy.md). Required setting for the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] image. |
   | **-e "MSSQL_COLLATION=\<*SQL_Server_collation*\>"** | Specify a custom SQL Server collation, instead of the default `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS`. |
   | **-p 1433:1433** | Map a TCP port on the host environment (first value) with a TCP port in the container (second value). In this example, [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is listening on TCP 1433 in the container and this container port is then exposed to TCP port 1433 on the host. |
   | **--name sql1** | Specify a custom name for the container rather than a randomly generated one. If you run more than one container, you can't reuse this same name. |
   | **--hostname sql1** | Used to explicitly set the container hostname. If you don't specify the hostname, it defaults to the container ID, which is a randomly generated system GUID. |
   | **-d** | Run the container in the background (daemon). |
   | **mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest** | The [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Linux container image. |

1. To view your Docker containers, use the `docker ps` command.

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-bash"

   ```bash
   sudo docker ps -a
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-powershell"

   ```PowerShell
   docker ps -a
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-cmd"

   ```cmd
   docker ps -a
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   You should see output similar to the following:

   ```output
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                        COMMAND                    CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
   d4a1999ef83e   mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest   "/opt/mssql/bin/perm..."   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:1433->1433/tcp, :::1433->1433/tcp   sql1
   ```

1. If the `STATUS` column shows a status of `Up`, then [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running in the container and listening on the port specified in the `PORTS` column. If the `STATUS` column for your [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] container shows `Exited`, see the [Troubleshooting section of the configuration guide](./sql-server-linux-docker-container-troubleshooting.md). The server is ready for connections once the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error logs display the message: `SQL Server is now ready for client connections. This is an informational message; no user action is required`. You can review the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error log inside the container using the command:

   ```bash
   docker exec -t sql1 cat /var/opt/mssql/log/errorlog | grep connection
   ```

   The `--hostname` parameter, as discussed above, changes the internal name of the container to a custom value. This value is the name you'll see returned in the following Transact-SQL query:

   ```sql
   SELECT @@SERVERNAME,
       SERVERPROPERTY('ComputerNamePhysicalNetBIOS'),
       SERVERPROPERTY('MachineName'),
       SERVERPROPERTY('ServerName');
   ```

   Setting `--hostname` and `--name` to the same value is a good way to easily identify the target container.

1. As a final step, change your SA password because the `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` is visible in `ps -eax` output and stored in the environment variable of the same name. See steps below.

::: moniker-end

## <a id="sapassword"></a> Change the system administrator password

The **SA** account is a system administrator on the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance that gets created during setup. After you create your [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] container, the `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` environment variable you specified is discoverable by running `echo $MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` in the container. For security purposes, change your SA password.

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-bash"
1. Choose a strong password to use for the SA user.

1. Use `docker exec` to run **sqlcmd** to change the password using Transact-SQL. In the following example, the old and new passwords are read from user input.

   ```bash
   sudo docker exec -it sql1 /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd \
   -S localhost -U SA \
    -P "$(read -sp "Enter current SA password: "; echo "${REPLY}")" \
    -Q "ALTER LOGIN SA WITH PASSWORD=\"$(read -sp "Enter new SA password: "; echo "${REPLY}")\""
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Newer versions of **sqlcmd** are secure by default. For more information about connection encryption, see [sqlcmd utility](../tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility.md) for Windows, and [Connecting with sqlcmd](../connect/odbc/linux-mac/connecting-with-sqlcmd.md) for Linux and macOS. If the connection doesn't succeed, you can add the `-No` option to **sqlcmd** to specify that encryption is optional, not mandatory.

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-powershell"
1. Choose a strong password to use for the SA user.

1. In the following example, replace the old password, `<YourStrong@Passw0rd>`, and the new password, `<YourNewStrong@Passw0rd>`, with your own password values.

   ```PowerShell
   docker exec -it sql1 /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd `
      -S localhost -U SA -P "<YourStrong@Passw0rd>" `
      -Q "ALTER LOGIN SA WITH PASSWORD='<YourNewStrong@Passw0rd>'"
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Newer versions of **sqlcmd** are secure by default. For more information about connection encryption, see [sqlcmd utility](../tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility.md) for Windows, and [Connecting with sqlcmd](../connect/odbc/linux-mac/connecting-with-sqlcmd.md) for Linux and macOS.

   ::: zone-end

## Connect to SQL Server

The following steps use the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] command-line tool, [**sqlcmd**](../tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility.md), inside the container to connect to [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

1. Use the `docker exec -it` command to start an interactive bash shell inside your running container. In the following example `sql1` is name specified by the `--name` parameter when you created the container.

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-bash"

   ```bash
   sudo docker exec -it sql1 "bash"
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-powershell"

   ```PowerShell
   docker exec -it sql1 "bash"
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-cmd"

   ```cmd
   docker exec -it sql1 "bash"
   ```

   ::: zone-end

1. Once inside the container, connect locally with **sqlcmd**, using its full path.

   ```bash
   /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P "<YourNewStrong@Passw0rd>"
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Newer versions of **sqlcmd** are secure by default. For more information about connection encryption, see [sqlcmd utility](../tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility.md) for Windows, and [Connecting with sqlcmd](../connect/odbc/linux-mac/connecting-with-sqlcmd.md) for Linux and macOS. If the connection doesn't succeed, you can add the `-No` option to **sqlcmd** to specify that encryption is optional, not mandatory.

   You can omit the password on the command-line to be prompted to enter it. For example:

   ```bash
     /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA
   ```

1. If successful, you should get to a **sqlcmd** command prompt: `1>`.

## Create and query data

The following sections walk you through using **sqlcmd** and Transact-SQL to create a new database, add data, and run a query.

### Create a new database

The following steps create a new database named `TestDB`.

1. From the **sqlcmd** command prompt, paste the following Transact-SQL command to create a test database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE TestDB;
   ```

1. On the next line, write a query to return the name of all of the databases on your server:

   ```sql
   SELECT Name from sys.databases;
   ```

1. The previous two commands weren't run immediately. Type `GO` on a new line to run the previous commands:

   ```sql
   GO
   ```

### Insert data

Next create a new table, `Inventory`, and insert two new rows.

1. From the *sqlcmd* command prompt, switch context to the new `TestDB` database:

   ```sql
   USE TestDB;
   ```

1. Create new table named `Inventory`:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Inventory (id INT, name NVARCHAR(50), quantity INT);
   ```

1. Insert data into the new table:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Inventory VALUES (1, 'banana', 150); INSERT INTO Inventory VALUES (2, 'orange', 154);
   ```

1. Type `GO` to run the previous commands:

   ```sql
   GO
   ```

### Select data

Now, run a query to return data from the `Inventory` table.

1. From the **sqlcmd** command prompt, enter a query that returns rows from the `Inventory` table where the quantity is greater than 152:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Inventory WHERE quantity > 152;
   ```

1. Run the command:

   ```sql
   GO
   ```

### Exit the sqlcmd command prompt

1. To end your **sqlcmd** session, type `QUIT`:

   ```sql
   QUIT
   ```

1. To exit the interactive command-prompt in your container, type `exit`. Your container continues to run after you exit the interactive bash shell.

## <a id="connectexternal"></a> Connect from outside the container

You can also connect to the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance on your Docker machine from any external Linux, Windows, or macOS tool that supports SQL connections. The external tool will use the IP address for the host machine.

The following steps use **sqlcmd** outside of your container to connect to [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] running in the container. These steps assume that you already have the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] command-line tools installed outside of your container. The same principles apply when using other tools, but the process of connecting is unique to each tool.

1. Find the IP address for your container's host machine, using `ifconfig` or `ip addr`.

1. For this example, install the **sqlcmd** tool on your client machine. For more information, see [Install **sqlcmd** on Windows](../tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility.md) or [Install **sqlcmd** on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup-tools.md).

1. Run **sqlcmd** specifying the IP address and the port mapped to port 1433 in your container. In this example, the port is the same as port 1433 on the host machine. If you specified a different mapped port on the host machine, you would use it here. You'll also need to open the appropriate inbound port on your firewall to allow the connection.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Newer versions of **sqlcmd** are secure by default. If the connection doesn't succeed, and you're using version 18 or higher, you can add the `-No` option to **sqlcmd** to specify that encryption is optional, not mandatory.

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-bash"

   ```bash
   sqlcmd -S <ip_address>,1433 -U SA -P "<YourNewStrong@Passw0rd>"
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-powershell"

   ```PowerShell
   sqlcmd -S <ip_address>,1433 -U SA -P "<YourNewStrong@Passw0rd>"
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="cs1-cmd"

   ```cmd
   sqlcmd -S <ip_address>,1433 -U SA -P "<YourNewStrong@Passw0rd>"
   ```

   ::: zone-end

1. Run Transact-SQL commands. When finished, type `QUIT`.

Other common tools to connect to [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] include:

- [Visual Studio Code](../tools/visual-studio-code/sql-server-develop-use-vscode.md)
- [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) on Windows](sql-server-linux-manage-ssms.md)
- [Azure Data Studio](../azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio.md)
- [mssql-cli (Preview)](https://github.com/dbcli/mssql-cli/blob/master/doc/usage_guide.md)
- [PowerShell Core](sql-server-linux-manage-powershell-core.md)

## Remove your container

If you want to remove the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] container used in this tutorial, run the following commands:

::: zone pivot="cs1-bash"

```bash
sudo docker stop sql1
sudo docker rm sql1
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="cs1-powershell"

```PowerShell
docker stop sql1
docker rm sql1
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="cs1-cmd"

```cmd
docker stop sql1
docker rm sql1
```

::: zone-end

> [!WARNING]  
> Stopping and removing a container permanently deletes any [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data in the container. If you need to preserve your data, [create and copy a backup file out of the container](tutorial-restore-backup-in-sql-server-container.md) or use a [container data persistence technique](sql-server-linux-docker-container-configure.md#persist).

## Docker demo
