# Introduction to adutil - Active Directory utility

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Linux](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-linux.md)]

The **adutil** tool is a command-line interface (CLI) utility for configuring and managing Windows Active Directory domains for SQL Server on Linux and containers, without switching between Windows and Linux machines to manage Active Directory.

Support for **adutil** is limited for SQL Server use cases only.

You don't need to use **adutil** to enable Active Directory authentication for SQL Server on Linux or containers. You can also use utilities like **ktpass**, as explained in [Tutorial: Use Active Directory authentication with SQL Server on Linux](sql-server-linux-active-directory-authentication.md).

The **adutil** tool is designed as a series of commands and subcommands, with extra flags that you specify as further input. Each top level command represents a category of administrative functions. Within that category, each subcommand is an operation. This article shows you how you can download and get started with **adutil**.

## Configure adutil for LDAP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

You should use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol over SSL (LDAPS) instead of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). If you want to learn more about LDAP, see [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](sql-server-linux-ad-auth-understanding.md#ldap). For more information on how to configure LDAPS and how it differs from LDAP, see [Enabling LDAPS for Client Authentication](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2980.ldap-over-ssl-ldaps-certificate.aspx#Enabling_LDAPS_for_Client_Authentication).

You can set the `useLdaps` option to `true` in the `adutil.json` configuration file, which is located at: `/var/opt/mssql/.adutil/adutil.json` when run under the `mssql` user. This JSON code sample shows how to configure the setting:

```json
{
    "useLdaps": "true"
}
```

By default, the `useLDAPS` setting is set to `false`. When configuring this setting and using **mssql-conf** to create the keytab (key table), make sure you run **mssql-conf** as the user `mssql`, which you can do by running the following command:

```bash
sudo su mssql
```

To set up the keytab using **mssql-conf**, see [Create the SQL Server service keytab file using mssql-conf](./sql-server-linux-ad-auth-adutil-tutorial.md#create-the-sql-server-service-keytab-file-using-mssql-conf).

## Install adutil

If you don't accept the EULA during the time of install, when you run the **adutil** command for the first time, you must run it with the `--accept-eula` flag (for all distributions).

# [RHEL](#tab/rhel)

1. Download the Microsoft Red Hat repository configuration file.

   ```bash
   sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/msprod.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/8/prod.repo
   ```

1. If you had a previous preview version of **adutil** installed, remove any older **adutil** packages using the below command.

   ```bash
   sudo yum remove adutil-preview
   ```

1. Run the following commands to install **adutil**. `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` accepts the EULA for **adutil**. The EULA is placed at the path `/usr/share/adutil/`.

   ```bash
   sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y yum install -y adutil
   ```

# [Ubuntu](#tab/ubuntu)

1. Import the public repository GPG keys and then register the Microsoft Ubuntu repository.

   ### Ubuntu 18.04

   ```bash
   curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc
   curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/prod.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/msprod.list
   ```

   ### Ubuntu 20.04

   ```bash
   curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc
   curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/prod.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/msprod.list
   ```

1. If you had a previous preview version of **adutil** installed, remove any older **adutil** packages using the below command.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get remove adutil-preview
   ```

1. Run the following command to install **adutil**. `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` accepts the EULA for **adutil**. The EULA is placed at the path `/usr/share/adutil/`.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install -y adutil
   ```

# [SLES](#tab/sles)

1. Add the Microsoft SQL Server repository to Zypper.

   ### SLES 12

   ```bash
   sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
   sudo zypper addrepo -fc https://packages.microsoft.com/config/sles/12/prod.repo
   ```

   ### SLES 15

   ```bash
   sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
   sudo zypper addrepo -fc https://packages.microsoft.com/config/sles/15/prod.repo
   ```

1. If you had a previous preview version of **adutil** installed, remove any older **adutil** packages using the below command.

   ```bash
   sudo zypper remove adutil-preview
   ```

1. Run the following command to install **adutil**. `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` accepts the EULA for **adutil**. The EULA is placed at the path `/usr/share/adutil/`.

   ```bash
   sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y zypper install -y adutil
   ```

## Use adutil to manage Windows Active Directory

Make sure that you download **adutil** to a host that is already joined to an Active Directory domain. You also need to obtain or renew the Kerberos TGT (ticket-granting ticket), using the **kinit** command and a privileged domain account. The account you use must have permission to create accounts and Service Principal Names (SPNs) on the domain.

Here are some examples of actions that you can perform using **adutil**. To see a list of top-level commands, type `adutil --help`. This command shows you the top-level commands that you can use to manage and interact with Active Directory.

```bash
$ adutil --help
adutil - A general AD utility
  Usage:
    adutil [account|delegation|group|keytab|machine|ou|spn|user|config]

       --accept-eula   Accepts the current EULA for adutil. This has no effect if the EULA has already been accepted.
```

To seek help with the next level of commands, you can run the following help option:

```bash

```

## Samples

Each command is documented so you can get started right away. Here are some of the typical activities that **adutil** is used for when configuring or administering Active Directory authentication for SQL Server on Linux and containers:

- Create an account in Active Directory:

  ```bash
  adutil user create --name sqluser --distname CN=sqluser,CN=Users,DC=CONTOSO,DC=COM
  ```

- Create SPNs associated with an account or service:

  ```bash
  adutil spn addauto -n sqluser -s MSSQLSvc -H mymachine.contoso.com -p 1433
  ```

- Create keytabs using **adutil**:

  ```bash
  adutil keytab createauto -k /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab -p 1433 -H mymachine.contoso.com --password 'P@ssw0rd' -s MSSQLSvc
  ```

You can refer to the reference manual page of **adutil** using the command `man adutil`.
