# Troubleshoot Active Directory authentication for SQL Server on Linux and containers

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Linux](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-linux.md)]

This article helps you troubleshoot Active Directory Domain Services authentication issues with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux and containers. It includes prerequisite checks and tips for a successful Active Directory configuration, and a list of common errors and troubleshooting steps.

## Validate current configuration

Before you begin troubleshooting, you must validate the current user, `mssql.conf`, Service Principal Name (SPN), and realm settings.

1. Obtain or renew the Kerberos TGT (ticket-granting ticket) using `kinit`:

   ```bash
   kinit privilegeduser@CONTOSO.COM
   ```

2. Run the following command, making sure that the user under which you're running this command has access to the `mssql.keytab`:

   ```bash
   /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf validate-ad-config /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab
   ```

   For more information about the `validate-ad-config` command, view the help using `/opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf validate-ad-config --help` command.

## DNS and reverse DNS lookups

1. DNS lookups on the domain name and NetBIOS name should return the same IP address, which normally matches the IP address for the domain controller (DC). Run these commands from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] host machine.

   ```bash
   nslookup contoso
   nslookup contoso.com
   ```

   If the IP addresses don't match, see [Join SQL Server on a Linux host to an Active Directory domain](sql-server-linux-active-directory-join-domain.md) to fix DNS lookups and communication with the DC.

1. Perform a reverse DNS (rDNS) lookup for each IP address listed in the previous results. This includes IPv4 and IPv6 addresses where applicable.

   ```bash
   nslookup <IPs returned from the above commands>
   ```

   All should return `<hostname>.contoso.com`. If that isn't the case, check the PTR (pointer) records that are created in Active Directory.

   You may have to work with your domain administrator to get rDNS working. If you can't add PTR entries for all the IP addresses returned, you can also [limit SQL Server to a subset of domain controllers](#validate-realm-information-in-krb5conf). This change affects any other services using `krb5.conf` on the host.

   For more information about reverse DNS, see [What is reverse DNS?](/azure/dns/dns-reverse-dns-overview#what-is-reverse-dns)

## Check keytab file and permissions

1. Check that you've created the keytab (key table) file, and that **mssql-conf** is configured to use the correct file with appropriate permissions. The keytab must be accessible to the `mssql` user account. For more information, see [Use adutil to configure Active Directory authentication with SQL Server on Linux](sql-server-linux-ad-auth-adutil-tutorial.md#create-the-sql-server-service-keytab-file-using-mssql-conf).

1. Make sure that you can list the contents of the keytab, and that you've added the correct SPNs, port, encryption type, and user account. If you don't type the passwords correctly when creating the SPNs and keytab entries, you'll encounter errors when attempting to sign in using Active Directory authentication.

   ```bash
   klist -kte /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab
   ```

   An example of a working keytab follows. The example uses two encryption types, but you can use just one or more depending on the encryption types supported in your environment. In the example, `sqluser@CONTOSO.COM` is the privileged account (which matches the **network.privilegedadaccount** setting in **mssql-conf**), and the host name for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is `sqllinux.contoso.com` listening on the default port **1433**.

   ```bash
   $ kinit privilegeduser@CONTOSO.COM
   Password for privilegeduser@CONTOSO.COM:

   $ klist
   Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1000
   Default principal: privilegeduser@CONTOSO.COM
   Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
   01/26/22 20:42:02  01/27/22 06:42:02  krbtgt/CONTOSO.COM@CONTOSO.COM
       renew until 01/27/22 20:41:57

   $ klist -kte mssql.keytab
   Keytab name: FILE:mssql.keytab
   KVNO Timestamp         Principal

      2 01/13/22 13:19:47 MSSQLSvc/sqllinux@CONTOSO.COM (aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96)
      2 01/13/22 13:19:47 MSSQLSvc/sqllinux@CONTOSO.COM (aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96)
      2 01/13/22 13:19:47 MSSQLSvc/sqllinux.contoso.com@CONTOSO.COM (aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96)
      2 01/13/22 13:19:47 MSSQLSvc/sqllinux.contoso.com@CONTOSO.COM (aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96)

      2 01/13/22 13:19:47 MSSQLSvc/sqllinux.contoso.com:5533@CONTOSO.COM (aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96)
      2 01/13/22 13:19:47 MSSQLSvc/sqllinux.contoso.com:5533@CONTOSO.COM (aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96)
      2 01/13/22 13:19:55 sqluser@CONTOSO.COM (aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96)
      2 01/13/22 13:19:55 sqluser@CONTOSO.COM (aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96)
    ```

## Validate realm information in `krb5.conf`

1. In `krb5.conf` (located at `/etc/krb5.conf`), check that you have provided values for the default realm, realm information, and domain to realm mapping. The following example is a sample `krb5.conf` file. For more information, see [Understanding Active Directory authentication for SQL Server on Linux and containers](sql-server-linux-ad-auth-understanding.md).

   ```ini
   [libdefaults]
   default_realm = CONTOSO.COM
    
   [realms]
   CONTOSO.COM = {
       kdc = adVM.contoso.com
       admin_server = adVM.contoso.com
       default_domain= contoso.com
   }
    
   [domain_realm]
   .contoso.com = CONTOSO.COM
   contoso.com = CONTOSO.COM
   ```

1. You can restrict [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to contact a subset of domain controllers, which is useful if your DNS configuration returns more domain controllers than [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] needs to contact. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux allows you to specify a list of domain controllers that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] contacts in a round-robin fashion when performing an LDAP lookup.

   There are two steps you need to complete. First, modify `krb5.conf` by adding any number of domain controllers that you need, prefixed with `kdc =`.

   ```ini
   [realms]
   CONTOSO.COM = {
     kdc = kdc1.contoso.com
     kdc = kdc2.contoso.com
     ..
     ..
   }
   ```

   Keep in mind that `krb5.conf` is a common Kerberos client configuration file, so any changes you make in this file will affect other services in addition to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Before making any changes, consult with your domain administrator.

   You can then enable the **network.enablekdcfromkrb5conf** setting using **mssql-conf**, and then restart [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set network.enablekdcfromkrb5conf true
   sudo systemctl restart mssql-server
   ```

## Troubleshoot Kerberos

See the following details to assist you in troubleshooting Active Directory authentication issues and identifying specific error messages.

### Trace Kerberos

After you create the user, SPNs, and keytabs, and configure **mssql-conf** to see that the Active Directory configuration for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux is correct, you can display the Kerberos trace messages to the console (`stdout`) when attempting to obtain or renew the Kerberos TGT with the privileged account, using this command:

```bash
root@sqllinux mssql# KRB5_TRACE=/dev/stdout kinit -kt /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab sqluser
```

If there aren't any problems, you should see output similar to the following sample. If not, the trace provides context about which steps you should review.

### Enable Kerberos and security-based PAL logging

You can enable `security.kerberos` and `security.ldap` logging to identify specific error messages in the PAL (Platform Abstraction Layer). Create a `logger.ini` file with the following content at `/var/opt/mssql/`, restart [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and then reproduce the failure. The PAL's Active Directory error and debug messages will be logged to `/var/opt/mssql/log/security.log`.

```ini
[Output:security]
Type = File
Filename = /var/opt/mssql/log/security.log
[Logger]
Level = Silent
[Logger:security.kerberos]
Level = Debug
Outputs = security
[Logger:security.ldap]
Level = debug
Outputs = security
```

You don't need to restart [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] for the logger changes to be picked up from `logger.ini`, but failures can occur during Active Directory service initialization on during [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] startup that would otherwise go unnoticed. Restarting [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ensures all the error messages are captured.

The security log continues to write to the drive until you remove the changes in `logger.ini`. Remember to disable `security.kerberos` and `security.ldap` logging once you've identified and resolved the problem to prevent running out of space on the drive.

The PAL logger generates log files in the following format:

```output
<DATETIME> <Log level> [<logger>] <<process/thread identifier>> <message>
```

For example, a sample line from the log follows:

```output
12/28/2021 13:56:31.609453055 Error [security.kerberos] <0003753757/0x00000324> Request ticket server MSSQLSvc/sql.contoso.com:1433@CONTOSO.COM kvno 3 enctype aes256-cts found in keytab but cannot decrypt ticket
```

Once you have PAL logging enabled and you reproduce the issue, look for the first message with a log-level of `Error`, then use the following table to find the error and follow the guidance and recommendation to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

## Common error messages

### Error message: "Login failed. The login is from an untrusted domain and cannot be used with Integrated authentication."

#### Possible cause

This error is encountered when you try logging in using an Active Directory account, once you have configured Active Directory authentication.

#### Guidance

This is a generic error message, and you must [enable PAL logging](#enable-kerberos-and-security-based-pal-logging) to identify the specific error message.

You can refer to this list of common errors to identify the possible cause for each error, then follow the troubleshooting guidance to resolve the issue.

|Error messages|
|---|
|[Windows NT user or group 'CONTOSO\user' not found](#error-windows-nt)|
|[Could not look up short domain name due to error](#error-short-domain-name)|
|[Could not perform rDNS lookup for host \<hostname\> due to error](#error-rdns-lookup)|
|[FQDN not returned by rDNS lookup](#error-fqdn-not-returned)|
|[Failed to bind to LDAP server](#error-failed-to-bind-to-ldap-server)|
|[Key table entry not found](#error-key-table-entry-not-found)|
|[No key table entry found for \<principal\>](#error-no-key-table-entry-found)|
|[Request ticket server \<principal\> not found in keytab (ticket kvno \<KVNO\>)](#error-request-ticket-server-not-found-kvno)|
|[Request ticket server \<principal\> kvno \<KVNO\> found in keytab but not with enctype \<encryption type\>](#error-request-ticket-server-not-found-enctype)|
|[Request ticket server \<principal\> kvno \<KVNO\> enctype \<encryption type\> found in keytab but cannot decrypt ticket](#error-request-ticket-server-not-found-decrypt)|

### <a id="error-windows-nt"></a> Error message: Windows NT user or group 'CONTOSO\user' not found

#### Possible cause

 You may encounter this error when trying to create the Windows login, or during [group refresh](sql-server-linux-ad-auth-understanding.md#sql-server-group-refresh).

#### Guidance

To validate the issue, please follow the guidance as documented for "Login failed. The login is from an untrusted domain and can't be used with Integrated authentication. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 18452)" [enable PAL logging](#enable-kerberos-and-security-based-pal-logging) to identify the specific error, and troubleshoot accordingly.

### <a id="error-short-domain-name"></a> Error message: "Could not look up short domain name due to error"

#### Possible cause

The Transact-SQL syntax to create an Active Directory login is:

```sql
CREATE LOGIN [CONTOSO\user] FROM WINDOWS;
```

The NetBIOS name (`CONTOSO`) is required in the command, but in the backend when performing an LDAP connection, the FQDN of the domain (`contoso.com`) must be provided. To do this conversion, a DNS lookup is performed on `CONTOSO` to resolve to the IP of a domain controller, which can then be bound to for LDAP queries.

#### Guidance

The error message "Could not look up short domain name due to error" suggests that `nslookup` for `contoso` doesn't resolve to IP address of the domain controller. You should review [DNS and reverse DNS lookups](#dns-and-reverse-dns-lookups) to confirm that `nslookup` for both the NetBIOS and domain name should match.

### <a id="error-rdns-lookup"></a> Error messages: "Could not perform rDNS lookup for host \<hostname\> due to error" or <a id="error-fqdn-not-returned"></a> "FQDN not returned by rDNS lookup"

#### Possible cause

This error message mostly indicates that the reverse DNS records (PTR records) don't exist for all domain controllers.

#### Guidance

Check the [DNS and reverse DNS lookups](#dns-and-reverse-dns-lookups). Once the domain controllers that don't have rDNS entries are identified, there are two options:

- **Add rDNS entries for all domain controllers**

  This isn't a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setting, and must be configured at the domain level. You may have to work with your domain administration team to create the required PTR records for all the domain controllers returned when running `nslookup` on the domain name.

- **Restrict [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to a subset of domain controllers**

  If adding PTR records isn't possible for all returned domain controllers, you can [limit SQL Server to a subset of domain controllers](#validate-realm-information-in-krb5conf).

### <a id="error-failed-to-bind-to-ldap-server"></a> Error message: "Failed to bind to LDAP server ldap://CONTOSO.COM:3268: Local Error"

#### Possible cause

This is a generic error from OpenLDAP, but normally means one of two things:

- No credentials
- rDNS problems

Here is one such example of the error message:

```output
12/09/2021 14:32:11.319933684 Error [security.ldap] <0000000142/0x000001c0> Failed to bind to LDAP server ldap://[CONTOSO.COM:3268]: Local error
```

#### Guidance

- **No credentials**

  Other error messages are thrown first if credentials won't load for LDAP connections. You should [enable PAL logging](#enable-kerberos-and-security-based-pal-logging) and check the error log for error messages before this one. If there aren't any other errors, it's most likely not a credentials issue. If one is found, then work on fixing the error message that you see. In most cases, it will be one of the error messages covered in this article.

- **rDNS problems**

  Check the [DNS and reverse DNS lookups](#dns-and-reverse-dns-lookups).

  When the OpenLDAP library connects to a domain controller, either the domain FQDN (`contoso.com`) or the DC's FQDN (`kdc1.contoso.com`) is provided. Once the connection is made (but before returning success to the caller), the OpenLDAP library checks the IP of the server it connected to. It will then perform a reverse DNS lookup and check that the name of the server connected to (`kdc1.contoso.com`) matches the domain that the connection was requested for (`contoso.com`). If this doesn't match, the OpenLDAP library fails the connection as a security feature. This is part of why the rDNS settings are so important for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux and have been in focus for this documentation.

### <a id="error-key-table-entry-not-found"></a> Error message: "Key table entry not found"

#### Possible cause

This error indicates access issues with the keytab file, or not having all the required entries in the keytab.

#### Guidance

Make sure the keytab file has the correct access level and permissions. The default location and the name for the keytab file is `/var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab`. To view the current permissions on all files under the secrets folder, you can run this command:

```bash
sudo ls -lrt /var/opt/mssql/secrets
```

You can use these commands to set the permissions and access level on the keytab file:

```bash
sudo chown mssql /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab
sudo chmod 440 /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab
```

For more details on listing the keytab entries and setting the correct permissions, see the previous [Check keytab file and permissions](#check-keytab-file-and-permissions) section. If any of the conditions in that section aren't met, you'll see this or equivalent error: `"Key table entry not found"`.

### <a id="error-no-key-table-entry-found"></a> Error message: "No key table entry found for \<principal\>"

#### Possible cause

When attempting to retrieve the credentials of `<principal>` from the keytab, no applicable entries were found.

#### Guidance

Follow the [Check keytab file and permissions](#check-keytab-file-and-permissions) section of this document to list all entries in the keytab. Make sure that `<principal>` is present. In this case, the principal account is usually the **network.privilegedadaccount** to which the SPNs are registered. If it isn't, then add it using the **adutil** command. For more information, see [Use adutil to configure Active Directory authentication with SQL Server on Linux](sql-server-linux-ad-auth-adutil-tutorial.md#create-the-sql-server-service-keytab-file-using-mssql-conf).

### <a id="error-request-ticket-server-not-found-kvno"></a> Error message: "Request ticket server \<principal\> not found in keytab (ticket kvno \<KVNO\>)"

#### Possible cause

This error indicates that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] couldn't find a keytab entry for the requested ticket with the specified KVNO (Key Version Number).

#### Guidance

Follow the [Check keytab file and permissions](#check-keytab-file-and-permissions) section of this document to list all entries in the keytab. If you can't find an error message that matches the `<principal>` and KVNO, add this entry by updating the keytab file using the steps mentioned in that section.

You can also run the following command to get the latest KVNO from the DC. Before you run this command, you need to obtain or renew the Kerberos TGT using the **kinit** command. For more information, see [Use adutil to create an Active Directory user for SQL Server and set the Service Principal Name (SPN)](sql-server-linux-ad-auth-adutil-tutorial.md#adutil-spn).

```bash
kvno MSSQLSvc/<hostname>
```

### <a id="error-request-ticket-server-not-found-enctype"></a> Error message: "Request ticket server \<principal\> kvno \<KVNO\> found in keytab but not with enctype \<encryption type\>"

#### Possible cause

This error means that the encryption type requested by the client wasn't present in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]'s keytab.

#### Guidance

To validate, follow the [Check keytab file and permissions](#check-keytab-file-and-permissions) section of this document to list all entries in the keytab. If you can't find an error message that matches the principal, KVNO, and encryption type, add this entry by updating the keytab file using the steps mentioned in that section.

### <a id="error-request-ticket-server-not-found-decrypt"></a> Error message: "Request ticket server \<principal\> kvno \<KVNO\> enctype \<encryption type\> found in keytab but can't decrypt ticket"

#### Possible cause

This error indicates that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] couldn't use a credential from the keytab file to decrypt the incoming authentication request. The error is often cased by an incorrect password.

#### Guidance

Recreate the keytab using the correct password. If you use **adutil**, follow the steps in [Use adutil to configure Active Directory authentication with SQL Server on Linux](sql-server-linux-ad-auth-adutil-tutorial.md) to create the keytab with the right password.
