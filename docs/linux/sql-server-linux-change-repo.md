# Configure repositories for installing and upgrading SQL Server on Linux

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Linux](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-linux.md)]

::: zone pivot="ld2-rhel"
This article describes how to configure the correct repository for [!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] installations and upgrades on Linux. At the top, your current selection is **Red Hat (RHEL)**.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="ld2-sles"
This article describes how to configure the correct repository for [!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] installations and upgrades on Linux. At the top, your current selection is **SUSE (SLES)**.

::: zone pivot="ld2-ubuntu"
This article describes how to configure the correct repository for [!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] installations and upgrades on Linux. At the top, your current selection is **Ubuntu**.   
::: zone-end

> [!TIP]  
> [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] is now available! To try it, use this article to configure the `mssql-server-2022` repository. Then install using the instructions in the [installation guide](sql-server-linux-setup.md).

## <a id="repositories"></a> Repositories

When you install SQL Server on Linux, you must configure a Microsoft repository. This repository is used to acquire the database engine package, **mssql-server**, and related SQL Server packages. There are currently three main repositories:

| Repository | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **2022** | `mssql-server-2022` | [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)] repository. |
| **2019** | `mssql-server-2019` | [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] Cumulative Update (CU) repository. |
| **2017** | `mssql-server-2017` | [!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)] Cumulative Update (CU) repository. |

The Cumulative Update (CU) repository contains packages for the base SQL Server release, and any bug fixes or improvements since that release. Cumulative updates are specific to a release version, such as [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)]. They are released on a regular cadence. GDR updates are released in the same CU repository.

Each release contains the full SQL Server package and all previous updates for that repository. You can also [downgrade](sql-server-linux-setup.md#rollback) to any release within your major version (for example, 2019).

## Configure repositories

::: zone pivot="ld2-rhel"
Use the steps in the following sections to configure repositories on Red Hat Enterprise Server (RHEL).
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="ld2-sles"
Use the steps in the following sections to configure repositories on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES).
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="ld2-ubuntu"
Use the steps in the following sections to configure repositories on Ubuntu.
::: zone-end

## Check for previously configured repositories

<!--RHEL-->
::: zone pivot="ld2-rhel"
First verify whether you have already registered a SQL Server repository.

1. View the files in the `/etc/yum.repos.d` directory with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo ls /etc/yum.repos.d
   ```

1. Look for a file that configures the SQL Server directory, such as `mssql-server.repo`.

1. Display the contents of the file using `cat`.

   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/yum.repos.d/mssql-server.repo
   ```

1. The **name** property is the configured repository. You can identify it with the table in the [Repositories](#repositories) section of this article.

::: zone-end

<!--SLES-->
::: zone pivot="ld2-sles"
First verify whether you have already registered a SQL Server repository.

1. Use `zypper info` to get information about any previously configured repository.

   ```bash
   sudo zypper info mssql-server
   ```

1. The **Repository** property is the configured repository. You can identify it with the table in the [Repositories](#repositories) section of this article.

::: zone-end

<!--Ubuntu-->
::: zone pivot="ld2-ubuntu"
First verify whether you have already registered a SQL Server repository.

1. View the contents of the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file.

   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```

1. Examine the package URL for mssql-server. You can identify it with the table in the [Repositories](#repositories) section of this article.

::: zone-end

## Remove old repository

<!--RHEL-->
::: zone pivot="ld2-rhel"
If necessary, remove the old repository with the following command.

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/yum.repos.d/mssql-server.repo
```

This command assumes that the file identified in the previous section was named `mssql-server.repo`.

::: zone-end

<!--SLES-->
::: zone pivot="ld2-sles"
If necessary, remove the old repository. Use one of the following commands based on the type of previously configured repository.

| Repository | Command to remove |
|---|---|
| **2022** | `sudo zypper removerepo 'packages-microsoft-com-mssql-server-2022'` |
| **2019 CU** | `sudo zypper removerepo 'packages-microsoft-com-mssql-server-2019'` |
| **2017 CU** | `sudo zypper removerepo 'packages-microsoft-com-mssql-server-2017'` |

::: zone-end

<!--Ubuntu-->
::: zone pivot="ld2-ubuntu"
If necessary, remove the old repository. Use one of the following commands based on the type of previously configured repository.

> [!NOTE]  
>
> - Starting with [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] CU10, Ubuntu 20.04 is supported.
> - Starting with [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] CU3 and [!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)] CU20, Ubuntu 18.04 is supported.
> - If you are using Ubuntu 16.04, change the path below to `/ubuntu/16.04` instead of `/ubuntu/18.04`, and use the correct [distribution code name](https://releases.ubuntu.com/).

| Repository | Command to remove |
|---|---|
| **2022** | `sudo add-apt-repository -r 'deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/20.04/mssql-server-2022 focal main'` |
| **2019 CU** | `sudo add-apt-repository -r 'deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/20.04/mssql-server-2019 focal main'` |
| **2017 CU** | `sudo add-apt-repository -r 'deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/mssql-server-2017 bionic main'` |

::: zone-end

## Configure new repository

<!--RHEL-->
::: zone pivot="ld2-rhel"
Configure the new repository to use for SQL Server installations and upgrades. Use one of the following commands to configure the repository of your choice.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following commands for [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] points to the RHEL 8 repository. RHEL 8 does not come preinstalled with python2, which is required by SQL Server. For more information, see the following blog on installing python2 and configuring it as the default interpreter: https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/installing-microsoft-sql-server-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-beta.
>
> Starting with [!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)] CU20, RHEL 8 is supported.
>
> If you are using RHEL 7 or RHEL 8, ensure the paths match `/rhel/7` or `/rhel/8`. Our packages are agnostic to RHEL minor versions. This means that if you are using RHEL 7.7, you will need to use the path `/rhel/7` to configure your repository.

| Repository | Version | Command |
|---|---|---|
| **2022** | 2022 | `sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/mssql-server.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/8/mssql-server-2022.repo` |
| **2019 CU** | 2019 | `sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/mssql-server.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/8/mssql-server-2019.repo` |
| **2017 CU** | 2017 | `sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/mssql-server.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/8/mssql-server-2017.repo` |

::: zone-end
