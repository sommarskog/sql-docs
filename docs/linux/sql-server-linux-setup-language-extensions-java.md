# Install SQL Server Java Language Extension on Linux

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2019 - Linux](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019-linux.md)] and later versions

Learn how to install the [Java Language Extension](../language-extensions/java-overview.md) component for [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux. The Java Language Extension is part of [SQL Server Language Extensions](../language-extensions/language-extensions-overview.md) and an add-on to the [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../includes/ssde-md.md)].

Although you can [install the Database Engine and Language Extensions concurrently](#install-all), it's a best practice to install and configure the [!INCLUDE [ssdenoversion-md](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] first so that you can resolve any issues before adding more components.

## Prerequisites

- The Linux version must be [supported by SQL Server](sql-server-linux-release-notes-2019.md#supported-platforms), but doesn't include the Docker Engine. Supported versions include:

  - [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](quickstart-install-connect-red-hat.md) (RHEL)
  - [SUSE Enterprise Linux Server](quickstart-install-connect-suse.md) (SLES)
  - [Ubuntu](quickstart-install-connect-ubuntu.md)

- You should have a tool for running Transact-SQL (T-SQL) commands. A query editor is necessary for post-install configuration and validation. We recommend [Azure Data Studio](../azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio.md?view=sql-server-2017&preserve-view=true#linux-installation), a free download that runs on Linux.

::: monikerRange="=sql-server-linux-ver15"

- Package location for the Java extensions is in the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Linux source repositories. If you already configured source repositories for the [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../includes/ssde-md.md)] install, you can run the `mssql-server-extensibility-java` package install commands using the same repo registration.

::: moniker-end

- Language Extensions is also supported on Linux containers. We don't provide prebuilt containers with Language Extensions, but you can create one from the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] containers using [an example template available on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-docker/tree/master/linux/preview/examples/mssql-mlservices).

- Language Extensions and [Machine Learning Services](../machine-learning/index.yml) are installed by default on [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Big Data Clusters. If you use Big Data Clusters, you don't need to follow the steps in this article. For more information, see [Use Machine Learning Services (Python and R) on Big Data Clusters](../big-data-cluster/machine-learning-services.md).

## Package list

On an internet-connected device, packages are downloaded and installed independently of the [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../includes/ssde-md.md)] using the package installer for each operating system. The following table describes all available packages.

| Package name | Applies-to | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mssql-server-extensibility` | All languages | Extensibility framework used for the Java language extension |
| `mssql-server-extensibility-java` | Java | **Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] on Linux only<br /><br />Extensibility framework used for the Java language extension and includes a supported Java runtime |

## Install Java language extension

::: monikerRange="=sql-server-linux-ver15"

You can install Language Extensions and Java on Linux by installing `mssql-server-extensibility-java`. When you install `mssql-server-extensibility-java`, the package automatically installs JRE 11 if it isn't already installed. It also adds the JVM path to an environment variable called `JRE_HOME`.

To enable the Java Language Extension, build a custom binary by following the instructions from the [Java Language Extension page on GitHub](
https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-language-extensions/tree/main/language-extensions/java).

> [!NOTE]  
> On an internet-connected server, package dependencies are downloaded and installed as part of the main package installation. If your server is not connected to the internet, see more details in the [offline setup](#offline-install).

::: moniker-end

::: monikerRange="=sql-server-linux-ver16"

You can download and install any Java runtime as desired, including the latest [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk) or officially licensed Java runtime. Starting with [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)], [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup doesn't install a Java runtime.

To enable the Java Language Extension, build a custom binary by following the instructions from the [Java Language Extension page on GitHub](
https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-language-extensions/tree/main/language-extensions/java).

::: moniker-end

## Post-install config (required)

1. Grant permissions on Linux

   You don't need to perform this step if you are using external libraries. The recommended way of working is using external libraries. For help with creating an external library from your `jar` file, see [CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY](../t-sql/statements/create-external-library-transact-sql.md)

   If you aren't using external libraries, you need to provide [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with permissions to execute the Java classes in your `jar`.

   To grant read and execute access to a `jar` file, run the following **chmod** command on the `jar` file. We recommend always putting your class files in a `jar` when you work with [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For help with creating a `jar`, see [How to create a jar file](../language-extensions/how-to/create-a-java-jar-file-from-class-files.md).

   ```bash
   chmod ug+rx <MyJarFile.jar>
   ```

   You also need to give `mssql_satellite` permissions the `jar` file to read/execute.

   ```bash
   chown mssql_satellite:mssql_satellite <MyJarFile.jar>
   ```

   Additional configuration is primarily through the [mssql-conf tool](sql-server-linux-configure-mssql-conf.md).

1. Add the `mssql` user account used to run the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service. This is required if you haven't run the setup previously.

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
   ```

1. Enable outbound network access. Outbound network access is disabled by default. To enable outbound requests, set the `outboundnetworkaccess` Boolean property using the **mssql-conf** tool. For more information, see [Configure SQL Server on Linux with mssql-conf](sql-server-linux-configure-mssql-conf.md#mlservices-outbound-access).

   ```bash
   # Run as SUDO or root
   # Enable outbound requests over the network
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set extensibility outboundnetworkaccess 1
   ```

1. Restart the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Launchpad service and the [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../includes/ssde-md.md)] instance to read the updated values from the INI file. A restart message reminds you whenever an extensibility-related setting is modified.

   ```bash
   systemctl restart mssql-launchpadd
   systemctl restart mssql-server.service
   ```

1. Enable external script execution using Azure Data Studio, or another tool like SQL Server Management Studio (Windows only), that runs T-SQL.

   ```sql
   EXEC sp_configure 'external scripts enabled', 1;
   RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE;
   ```

1. Restart the `mssql-launchpadd` service again.

1. For each database you want to use language extensions in, you need to register the external language with [CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE](../t-sql/statements/create-external-language-transact-sql.md). See steps in the next section.

## Register external language

For each database you want to use language extensions in, you need to register the external language with [CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE](../t-sql/statements/create-external-language-transact-sql.md).

The following example adds an external language called Java to a database on [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE Java
FROM (CONTENT = N'/opt/mssql-extensibility/lib/java-lang-extension.tar.gz',
    FILE_NAME = 'javaextension.so',
    ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES = N'{"JRE_HOME":"/opt/mssql/lib/zulu-jre-11"}');
```

For the Java extension, the environment variable `JRE_HOME` is used to determine the path to find and initialize the JVM from.

The `CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE` DDL provides a parameter (`ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`) to set environment variables specifically for the process hosting the extension. This process is the recommended and most effective way to set environment variables required by external language extensions.

For more information, see [CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE](../t-sql/statements/create-external-language-transact-sql.md).

## Verify installation

Java feature integration doesn't include libraries, but you can run `grep -r JRE_HOME /etc` to confirm creation of the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

To validate installation, run a T-SQL script that executes a system stored procedure invoking Java. You need a query tool for this task. Azure Data Studio is a good choice. Other commonly used tools such as SQL Server Management Studio is Windows-only. If you have a Windows computer with these tools, use it to connect to your Linux installation of the [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../includes/ssde-md.md)].

::: monikerRange="=sql-server-linux-ver15"

## <a id="install-all"></a> Full install of SQL Server and Java Language Extension

You can install and configure the [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../includes/ssde-md.md)] and Java Language Extension in one procedure by appending Java packages and parameters on a command that installs the [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../includes/ssde-md.md)].

1. Provide a command line that includes the [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../includes/ssde-md.md)], plus language extension features.

   You can add Java extensibility to a [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../includes/ssde-md.md)] install.

   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y mssql-server mssql-server-extensibility-java
   ```

1. Accept license agreements and complete the post-install configuration. Use the **mssql-conf** tool for this task.

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
   ```

   You are prompted to accept the license agreement for the [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../includes/ssde-md.md)], choose an edition, and set the administrator password.

1. Restart the service, if prompted to do so.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mssql-server.service
   ```

## Unattended installation

Use the [unattended install](./sql-server-linux-setup.md#unattended) for the Database Engine and add the packages for `mssql-server-extensibility-java`.

## <a id="offline-install"></a> Offline installation

Follow the [Offline installation](sql-server-linux-setup.md#offline) instructions for steps on installing the packages. Find your download site, and then download specific packages using the package list later in this section.

> [!TIP]  
> Several of the package management tools provide commands that can help you determine package dependencies. For yum, use `sudo yum deplist [package]`. For Ubuntu, use `sudo apt-get install --reinstall --download-only [package name]` followed by `dpkg -I [package name].deb`.

#### Download site

You can download the packages from [https://packages.microsoft.com/](https://packages.microsoft.com/). All of the packages for Java are colocated with the [!INCLUDE [ssde-md](../includes/ssde-md.md)] package.

## Limitations

Implied authentication is currently not available on Linux at this time, which means you can't connect back to the server from in-progress Java to access data or other resources.

### Resource governance

There is parity between Linux and Windows for [Resource governance](../t-sql/statements/create-external-resource-pool-transact-sql.md) for external resource pools, but the statistics for [sys.dm_resource_governor_external_resource_pools](../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-resource-governor-external-resource-pools.md) currently have different units on Linux.

> [!NOTE]  
> Statistics in the following table are sourced from the specified Control Groups (cgroups) subsystems.

| Column name | Description | Value on Linux |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `peak_memory_kb` | The maximum amount of memory used for the resource pool. | On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the `memory` subsystem, where the value is `memory.max_usage_in_bytes` |
| `write_io_count` | The total write IOs issued since the Resource Governor statistics were reset. | On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the `blkio` subsystem, where the value on the write row is `blkio.throttle.io_serviced` |
| `read_io_count` | The total read IOs issued since the Resource Governor statistics were reset. | On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the `blkio` subsystem, where value on the read row is `blkio.throttle.io_serviced` |
| `total_cpu_kernel_ms` | The cumulative CPU user kernel time in milliseconds since the Resource Governor statistics were reset. | On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the `cpuacct` subsystem, where the value on the user row is `cpuacct.stat` |
| `total_cpu_user_ms` | The cumulative CPU user time in milliseconds since the Resource Governor statistics were reset. | On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the `cpuacct` subsystem, where the value on the system row value is `cpuacct.stat` |
| `active_processes_count` | The number of external processes running at the moment of the request. | On Linux, this statistic is sourced from the `pids` subsystem, where the value is `pids.current` |
