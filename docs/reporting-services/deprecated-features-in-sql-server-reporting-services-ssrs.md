# Deprecated features in SQL Server Reporting Services

This article describes deprecated features in the different versions of SQL Server Reporting Services. The features are still available in the release in which they are deprecated; however the features are scheduled to be removed in a future release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Don't use deprecated features in new applications.

When we mark a feature as deprecated, it means:

- The feature is in maintenance mode only. We'll make no new changes, including changes related to interoperability with new features.
- We strive not to remove a deprecated feature from future releases, to make upgrades easier. However, in rare situations, we may choose to permanently remove the feature from Reporting Services if it limits future innovations.
- For new development work, we don't recommend using deprecated features.
