The Report Viewer web part has a couple of settings that can be configured. These settings can be enabled and disabled on the SharePoint site settings page by a site administrator. Each site has its own settings. Additionally, these settings will not be reset after reinstalling the Report Viewer web part.

## Accessing the site settings page

The site settings can be accessed by:

1. In your SharePoint site, select the **gear** icon in the upper left and select **Site Settings**.

    ![Site settings from the gear icon.](media/sharepoint-site-settings.png)

2. Clicking **Report Viewer Web Part Settings** in the **Reporting Services** site settings group.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The site settings can also be reached by navigating directly to `<site>/_layouts/15/ReportViewerWebPart/ReportViewerWebPartSettings.aspx`
