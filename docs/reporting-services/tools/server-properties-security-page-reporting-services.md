# Server Properties (Security Page) - Reporting Services

  Use this [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] page in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull_md](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to turn off features that can potentially compromise a report server. Turning off these features limits some functionality, but can improve the overall security of the report server by mitigating specific threats.  
  
 To open this page:
 1) Start [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].
 2) Connect to a report server instance.
 3) Right-click the report server name, and select **Properties**.
 4) Click **Security** to open this page.  
  
## Options

### Enable Windows-Integrated Security for report data sources

 Specify whether a connection to a report data source is using the Windows security token of the user who requested the report.  
  
 If you turn off the feature, the Windows-Integrated Security feature in the report data source property pages becomes unavailable. If your report data sources are configured for Windows-integrated security and you subsequently turn off this feature, the report server immediately updates all your data source connection properties to prompt for credentials.  
  
### Enable Ad Hoc Reporting

 Specify whether users can perform ad hoc queries from a Report Builder report, where new reports are automatically generated when a user clicks data of interest.  
  
 Setting this option determines whether the **EnableLoadReportDefinition** property on the report server is set to **True** or **False**. If you clear this option, the property is set to **False** and report server doesn't generate clickthrough reports that are created during data exploration. All calls to the **LoadReportDefinition** method are blocked.  
  
 Turning off this option mitigates a threat whereby a malicious user launches a denial of service attack by overloading the report server with **LoadReportDefinition** requests.
