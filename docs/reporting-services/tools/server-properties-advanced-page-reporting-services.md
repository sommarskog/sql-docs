# Server Properties Advanced Page - Power BI Report Server & Reporting Services

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto-2016-and-later](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-2016-and-later.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto-pbirsi](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbirs.md)]

Use this page to set system properties on the report server. There are a number of ways to set system properties. This tool provides a graphical user interface so that you can set properties without having to write code.

To open this page, start SQL Server Management Studio, connect to a report server instance, right-click the report server name, and select **Properties**. Select **Advanced** to open this page.

## Options

### AccessControlAllowCredentials

*Power BI Report Server, Reporting Services 2017 and later only* 

Indicates whether the response to the client request can be exposed when the `credentials` flag is set to true. The default value is **false**.

### AccessControlAllowHeaders

*Power BI Report Server, Reporting Services 2017 and later only* 

A comma-separated list of headers that the server will allow when a client makes a request. This property can be an empty string, specifying * will allow all headers.

### AccessControlAllowMethods

*Power BI Report Server, Reporting Services 2017 and later only* 

A comma-separated list of HTTP methods that the server will allow when a client makes a request. The default values are (GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE), specifying * will allow all methods.

### AccessControlAllowOrigin

*Power BI Report Server, Reporting Services 2017 and later only* 

A comma-separated list of origins that the server will allow when a client makes a request. The default value is blank, which prevents all requests, specifying * will allow all origins when credentials aren't set; if credentials are specified an explicit list of origins must be specified.

### AccessControlExposeHeaders

*Power BI Report Server, Reporting Services 2017 and later only* 

A comma-separated list of headers that the server will expose to clients. The default value is blank.

### AccessControlMaxAge

*Power BI Report Server, Reporting Services 2017 and later only* 

Specifies the number of seconds the results of the preflight request can be cached. The default value is 600 (10 minutes).

### AllowedResourceExtensionsForUpload

*Power BI Report Server, Reporting Services 2017 and later only* 

Set extensions of resources that can be uploaded to the report server. Extensions for built-in file types like &ast;.rdl and &ast;.pbix aren't required to be included. Default is "&ast;, &ast;.xml, &ast;.xsd, &ast;.xsl, &ast;.png, &ast;.gif, &ast;.jpg, &ast;.tif, &ast;.jpeg, &ast;.tiff, &ast;.bmp, &ast;.pdf, &ast;.svg, &ast;.rtf, &ast;.txt, &ast;.doc, &ast;.docx, &ast;.pps, &ast;.ppt, &ast;.pptx".

### CustomHeaders 

*Power BI Report Server January 2020, Reporting Services 2019 and later only*

Sets header values for all URLs matching the specified regex pattern. Users can update the CustomHeaders value with valid XML to set header values for selected request URLs. Admins can add any number of headers in the XML. By default in Reporting Services 2019, there are no custom headers and the value is blank. By default in Power BI Report Server January 2020 and later, the value is this:

```xml
<CustomHeaders>
    <Header>
        <Name>X-Frame-Options</Name>
        <Pattern>(?(?=.*api.*|.*rs:embed=true.*|.*rc:toolbar=false.*)(^((?!(.+)((\/api)|(\/(.+)(rs:embed=true|rc:toolbar=false)))).*$))|(^(?!(http|https):\/\/([^\/]+)\/powerbi.*$)))</Pattern>
        <Value>SAMEORIGIN</Value>
    </Header>
</CustomHeaders>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Too many headers may impact performance. 

We recommend validating the configuration of your topology to ensure the set of headers is compatible with your deployment of Reporting Services. It's possible to choose settings that cause errors in browsers if the browsers don't also have the appropriate settings. For example, you shouldn't add an HSTS configuration if your server isn't configured for https. Incompatible headers may result in browser rendering errors.

#### CustomHeaders XML format

```xml
<CustomHeaders>
    <Header>
        <Name>{Name of the header}</Name>
        <Pattern>{Regex pattern to match URLs}</Pattern>
        <Value>{Value of the header}</Value>
    </Header>
</CustomHeaders>
```

#### Setting the CustomHeaders property

- You can set it using [SetSystemProperties](/dotnet/api/reportservice2010.reportingservice2010.setsystemproperties) SOAP endpoint passing CustomHeaders property as parameter.
- You can use REST endpoint [UpdateSystemProperties](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/microsoft-rs/PBIRS/2.0#/System/UpdateSystemProperties):  `/System/Properties` passing CustomHeaders property

#### Example

The below example shows how to set the HSTS and other custom headers for URLs with matching regex pattern.

```xml
<CustomHeaders>
    <Header>
        <Name>Strict-Transport-Security</Name>
        <Pattern>(.+)\/Reports\/mobilereport(.+)</Pattern>
        <Value>max-age=86400; includeSubDomains=true</Value>
    </Header>
    <Header>
        <Name>Embed</Name>
        <Pattern>(.+)(/reports/)(.+)(rs:embed=true)</Pattern>
        <Value>True</Value>
    </Header>
</CustomHeaders>
```

The first header in the above XML adds `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=86400; includeSubDomains=true` header to the matched requests.
- http://adventureworks/Reports/mobilereport/New%20Mobile%20Report - Regex matched and will set HSTS header
- http://adventureworks/ReportServer/mobilereport/New%20Mobile%20Report – Match Failed

The second header in above XML adds `Embed: True` header for URL which contains `/reports/` and `rs:embed=true` query parameter.
- https://adventureworks/reports/mobilereport/New%20Mobile%20Report?rs:embed=true - Match
- https://adventureworks/reports/mobilereport/New%20Mobile%20Report?rs:embed=false - Fail to Match

### CustomUrlLabel and CustomUrlValue

Default is **True**.

### EnableLoadReportDefinition
Select this option to specify whether users can perform an unplanned report execution from a Report Builder report. Setting this option determines the value of the **EnableLoadReportDefinition** property on the report server.  

If you clear this option, the property is set to False. Report server won't generate clickthrough reports for reports that use a report model as a data source. Any calls to the LoadReportDefinition method are blocked.  

Turning off this option mitigates a threat whereby a malicious user launches a denial of service attack by overloading the report server with LoadReportDefinition requests.
