# Tutorial: How to Locate and Start Reporting Services Tools (SSRS)

This tutorial introduces the tools used to configure a report server, manage report server content and operations, and create and publish paginated and mobile [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] reports. If you are already familiar with the tools, you can move on to other tutorials to learn skills for using [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. For other tutorials, see [Reporting Services Tutorials &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/reporting-services-tutorials-ssrs.md).

## <a name="bkmk_configuration_manager"></a> Report Server Configuration Manager (Native Mode)
Use the Native mode configuration manager to complete the following:

- Specify the service account.
- Create or upgrade the report server database.
- Modify the connection properties.
- Specify URLs.
- Manage encryption keys.
- Configure unattended report processing and e-mail report delivery.

**Installation:** [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager is installed when you install [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Native mode. For more information, see [Install Reporting Services Native Mode Report Server](../../reporting-services/install-windows/install-reporting-services-native-mode-report-server.md).

### To start the Report Server Configuration Manager

1. In the Windows start menu, type **reporting** and in the **Apps** search results, click **Report Server Configuration Manager**.

    ![Report Server Configuration Manager on start](../../reporting-services/tools/media/bi-ssrs-configmanager-win8-startscreen.gif "Report Server Configuration Manager on start")

    **Or**

    Click **Start**, then click **Programs**, then click [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentUI](../../includes/sscurrentui-md.md)], then click **Configuration Tools**, and then click **Report Server Configuration Manager**.

    The **Report Server Installation Instance Selection** dialog box appears so that you can select the report server instance you want to configure.

2. In **Server Name**, specify the name of the computer on which the report server instance is installed. The name of the local computer is specified by default, but you can also type the name of a remote [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.

    If you specify a remote computer, click **Find** to establish a connection. The report server must be configured for remote administration in advance. For more information, see [Configure a Report Server for Remote Administration](../../reporting-services/report-server/configure-a-report-server-for-remote-administration.md).

3. In **Instance Name**, choose the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] instance that you want to configure. Only SQL Server 2008 and later report server instances appear in the list. You can't configure earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].

4. Click **Connect**.

5. To verify that you launched the tool, compare your results to the following image:

    ![Reporting Services Configuration tool](../../reporting-services/tools/media/rs-ui-reportserverconfigkatmai.png "Reporting Services Configuration tool")

 **Next Steps:** [Configure and Administer a Report Server &#40;SSRS Native Mode&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-server/configure-and-administer-a-report-server-ssrs-native-mode.md) and [Report Server Configuration Manager &#40;Native Mode&#41;](../../reporting-services/install-windows/reporting-services-configuration-manager-native-mode.md).

## Web Portal (Native Mode)

Use [Web portal (SSRS Native Mode)](../../reporting-services/web-portal-ssrs-native-mode.md) to set permissions, manage subscriptions and schedules, and work with reports. You can also use the Web Portal to view reports.

**Installation:** The Web Portal is installed when you install [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Native mode: [Install Reporting Services Native Mode Report Server](../../reporting-services/install-windows/install-reporting-services-native-mode-report-server.md)

Before you can open the Web Portal, you must have sufficient permissions (initially, only members of the local Administrators group have permissions that provide access to the Web Portal features). The Web Portal provides different pages and options depending on the role assignments of the current user. Users who have no permissions will get an empty page. Users with permissions to view reports will get links that they can click to open the reports. To learn more about permissions, see [Roles and Permissions &#40;Reporting Services&#41;](../../reporting-services/security/roles-and-permissions-reporting-services.md).

### To start The Web Portal

1. Open your browser. For information on supported browsers and browser versions, see [Browser Support for Reporting Services](../../reporting-services/browser-support-for-reporting-services-and-power-view.md).

2. In the address bar of the Web browser, type the Web Portal URL. By default, the URL is `https://<serverName>/reports`. You can use the Reporting Services Configuration tool to confirm the server name and URL. For more information about URLs used in [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], see [Configure Report Server URLs &#40;Report Server Configuration Manager&#41;](../../reporting-services/install-windows/configure-report-server-urls-ssrs-configuration-manager.md).

3. The Web Portal opens in the browser window. The startup page is the Home folder. Depending on permissions, you might see additional folders, hyperlinks to reports, and resource files within the startup page. You might also see additional buttons and commands on the toolbar.

4. If you run the Web Portal on the local report server, see [Configure a Native Mode Report Server for Local Administration &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-server/configure-a-native-mode-report-server-for-local-administration-ssrs.md).

## <a name="bkmk_managements_studio"></a> Management Studio

Report server administrators can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] to manage a report server alongside other [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] component servers. For more information, see the [SQL Server Management Studio](../../ssms/quickstarts/ssms-connect-query-sql-server.md) tutorial.

### To Start SQL Server Management Studio

1. From the Windows start menu, type **sql server** and in the **Apps** search results, click **SQL Server Management Studio**.

    ![SQL Server Management Studio from the Windows start menu](../../reporting-services/tools/media/bi-ssms-win8-startscreen.gif "SQL Server Management Studio from the Windows start menu")

    **Or**

    Click **Start**, then click **All Programs**, then click [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentUI](../../includes/sscurrentui-md.md)], and then click **SQL Server Management Studio**. The **Connect to Server** dialog box appears.

2. If the **Connect to Server** dialog box doesn't appear, in **Object Explorer**, click **Connect** and then select **Reporting Services**.

3. In the **Server type** list, select **Reporting Services**. If [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] isn't on the list, it isn't installed.

4. In the **Server name** list, select a report server instance. Local instances appear in the list. You can also type the name of a remote [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.

5. Click **Connect**. You can expand the root node to set server properties, modify role definitions, or turn off report server features.

## <a name="bkmk_ssdt"></a> SQL Server Data Tools with Report Designer and Report Wizard

You have a choice of two different tools for creating [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] paginated reports: Report Designer and [Report Builder](#bkmk_report_builder).

Report Designer is available in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] - Visual Studio. The Report Designer design surface includes tabbed windows, wizards, and menus used to access report authoring features. The report designer tool becomes available when you choose a Report Server Project or a Report Server Wizard template in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. To learn more, see [Reporting Services in SQL Server Data Tools &#40;SSDT&#41;](../../reporting-services/tools/reporting-services-in-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md).

Download [SQL Server Data Tools](../../ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md).

### To start Report Designer

1. Open **SQL Server Data Tools**.

2. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.

3. In the **Project Types** list, click **Business Intelligence Projects**.

4. In the **Templates** list, click **Report Server Project**. The following diagram shows how the project templates appear in the dialog box:
