# Reporting Services in SQL Server Management Studio (SSRS)
  Report server administrators can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to:  
  
-   Enable features, set server defaults, and manage running jobs.  
  
-   View custom reports. In Object Explorer, most nodes display a custom reports option. You must have administrator permissions. The schema of a custom report must match the schema of the installed reports. For more information, see [Custom Reports in Management Studio](../../ssms/object/custom-reports-in-management-studio.md) and [Find the Report Definition Schema Version &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/reports/find-the-report-definition-schema-version-ssrs.md).  
  
 The next section contains links to articles that contain step-by-step instructions for performing various reporting tasks using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)]. You can also create and manage shared schedules in the web portal.
