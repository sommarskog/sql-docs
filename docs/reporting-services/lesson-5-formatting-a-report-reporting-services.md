# Lesson 5: Formatting a report (Reporting Services)

Now that you've added a data region and some fields to the Sales Orders report, you can format the date and currency fields and the column headers.

## <a name="bkmk_format_date"></a>Format the Date

The Date field expression displays date and time information by default. You can format it to display only the date.

1. Select the **Design** tab.
2. Right-click the cell with the `[Date]` field expression and then select **Text Box Properties**.
3. Select **Number**, and then in the **Category** field, select **Date**.
4. In the **Type** box, select **January 31, 2000**.
5. Select **OK** to apply the format.
6. Preview the report to see the change to the `[Date]` field formatting, and then change back to design view.

## <a name="bkmk_format_currency"></a>Format the Currency

The LineTotal field expression displays a general number. You can format it to display the number as currency.

1. Right-click the cell with the `[LineTotal]` expression, and select **Text Box Properties**.
2. Select **Number** in the left-most column list box, and **Currency** from the **Category** list box.
3. If your regional setting is English (United States), the defaults in the **Type** list box should be:
    - **Decimal places: 2**
    - **Negative numbers: ($12345.00)**
    - **Symbol: $ English (United States)**
4. Select **Use 1000 separator (,)**. If the sample text displays **$12,345.00**, then your settings are correct.
5. Select **OK** to apply the format.
6. Preview the report to see the change to the `[LineTotal]` expression column and then change back to design view.  

## <a name="bkmk_change_textstyle"></a>Change Text Style and Column Widths

You can add other formatting to your report by highlighting the header row, and adjusting the widths of the data columns.

### To format header rows and table columns

1. Select the table so that column and row handles appear above and next to the table. The gray bars along the top and side of the table are the column and row handles.

2. Point to the line between column handles so that the cursor changes into a double arrow. Drag the columns to the size you want.

4. Preview your report. It should display as below:

5. From the **File** menu, select **Save All** to save the report.
