# Using the Setting Class for a Delivery Extension
  The <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.Setting> class is located in the <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces> namespace and represents information about extension settings for a delivery extension. The <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.Setting> class provides infrastructure for storing information about the settings that are required in order for a delivery extension to function properly. For example, in Report Server E-Mail delivery, a user is required to supply settings specific to e-mail delivery, such as the recipient's address, the sender's address, the subject line of the e-mail, and more. Undoubtedly, your custom delivery providers will require the user to supply specific settings in order for the delivery extension to deliver notifications and reports.  
  
 The <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.Setting> class is used when implementing the <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.IDeliveryExtension.ExtensionSettings%2A> property of the <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.IDeliveryExtension> interface. The <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.Setting> class is also used for processing the extension setting data that is supplied by a user when a subscription or notification is created.  
  
 For an example of how to use the <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.Setting> class, see [SQL Server Reporting Services Product Samples](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=177889).
