# rsAccessedDenied - Reporting Services error
  The [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] error **rsAccessedDenied** occurs when a user does not have permission to perform an action. For example, they don't have a role assignment that allows them to open a report, or they didn't open their browser with the required permissions.

- If the error occurred while accessing the report server directly through a URL, the exception is mapped to an HTTP 401 error.  
  
- If the error occurred while using the web portal, the exception is typically mapped to an HTTP 401 error, or other defined HTML error page.  
  
- If the error occurred during a scheduled operation, subscription, or delivery, the error will appear in the report server log file only.

## User action  
 Permission to access report server content and operations are granted through role assignments. On a new installation, only local administrators have access to a report server. To grant access to other users, a local administrator must create a role assignment that specifies a domain user or group account, one or more roles that define the tasks the user can perform, and a scope (usually the Home folder or root node of the report server folder hierarchy). You can use the web portal to create role assignments. For more information, see [Role Assignments](../../reporting-services/security/role-assignments.md)
.  
  
 This error is also caused by local administration of the report server. For more information, see [Configure a Native Mode Report Server for Local Administration &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-server/configure-a-native-mode-report-server-for-local-administration-ssrs.md).
