# Lesson 2: Specifying Connection Information (Reporting Services)

In lesson 1, you added a [!INCLUDE[ssrsnoversion-md](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] paginated report to your Tutorial project.
  
In this lesson, you're going to define a *data source*, connection information the report uses to access data from a relational database or other sources.

For this report, you're going to add the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] sample database as your data source. This tutorial assumes that the database is located in the default instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] and installed on your local computer.  

## To set up a connection  

1. In the **Report Data** pane, select **New** > **Data Source**. If the **Report Data** pane isn't visible, then select **View** menu > **Report Data**.

    ![Screenshot of the Report Data pane with New > Data Source selected.](media/ssrs-table-tutorial-2-new-data-source.png)

    The **Data Source Properties** dialog box opens with the **General** section displayed.

2. In the **Name** text box, type "AdventureWorks2022".

3. Select the **Embedded connection** radio button.

4. In the **Type** dropdown selection box, select "Microsoft SQL Server".
  
5. In the **Connection string** text box, type the following string:

    `Data source=localhost; initial catalog=AdventureWorks2022`

    > [!NOTE]
    > This connection string assumes that [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], the report server, and the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database are all installed on the local computer.
    >
    >Change the connection string and replace "localhost" with the name of your database server/instance if the assumption isn't true. If you're using [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] or a SQL Server named instance, you need to modify your connection string to include instance information. For example:
    >
    > `Data source=localhost\SQLEXPRESS; initial catalog=AdventureWorks2022`
    >
    > For more information about connection strings, you can refer to the `See also` section below.

6. Select the **Credentials** tab, and under the section **Change the credentials used to connect to the data source**, select the **Use Windows Authentication (integrated security)** radio button.

7. Select **OK** to complete the process.

Report Designer adds the data source AdventureWorks2022 to the **Report Data** pane.

## Next steps

In this lesson, you've successfully defined a connection to the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] sample database. Continue with [Lesson 3: Defining a Dataset for the Table Report &#40;Reporting Services&#41;](lesson-3-defining-a-dataset-for-the-table-report-reporting-services.md) to define a dataset for the report.
