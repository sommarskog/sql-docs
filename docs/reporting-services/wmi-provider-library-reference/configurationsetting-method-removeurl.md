# ConfigurationSetting Method - RemoveURL
  Removes a URL reserved for the report server. If there are multiple URLs that need to be removed, this must be done one by one calling this API.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vb  
Public Sub RemoveURL(ByVal Application As String, _  
    ByVal UrlString As String, ByVal Lcid As Int32, _  
    ByRef [Error] As String, ByRef HRESULT As Int32)  
```  
  
```csharp  
public void RemoveURL(string Application, string UrlString, int Lcid,   
    out string Error, out int HRESULT);  
```  
  
## Parameters  
 *Application*  
 The name of application for which to remove the reservation.  
  
 *URLString*  
 The URL for the reservation.  
  
 *lcid*  
 The locale to use for the error messages returned.  
  
 *Error*  
 [out] The description of the error that occurred.  
  
 *HRESULT*  
 [out] Value indicating whether the call succeeded or failed.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns an *HRESULT* indicating success or failure of the method call. A value of 0 indicates that the method call was successful; an error code indicates the call was not successful.  
  
## Remarks  
 *UrlString* does not include the Virtual Directory name - the [SetVirtualDirectory Method &#40;WMI MSReportServer_ConfigurationSetting&#41;](../../reporting-services/wmi-provider-library-reference/configurationsetting-method-setvirtualdirectory.md) method is provided for that purpose.  
  
 Before calling the [ReserveURL](../../reporting-services/wmi-provider-library-reference/configurationsetting-method-reserveurl.md) method, you must supply a value for the VirtualDirectory configuration property for the *Application* parameter. Use the [SetVirtualDirectory Method &#40;WMI MSReportServer_ConfigurationSetting&#41;](../../reporting-services/wmi-provider-library-reference/configurationsetting-method-setvirtualdirectory.md) method to set the VirtualDirectory property.  
  
 If a TLS/SSL Certificate was provisioned by [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] and no other URLs need it, it is removed.  
  
 This method causes all non-configuration app domains to hard recycle and stop during this operation; app domains are restarted after this operation complete.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Namespace:** [!INCLUDE[ssRSWMInmspcA](../../includes/ssrswminmspca-md.md)]
