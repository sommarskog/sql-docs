# Tasks and Permissions - System-Level Tasks
  A system-level task is a collection of permissions that relate to operations that apply to the report server site as a whole. [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] also includes item-level tasks that apply to specific items. For more information, see [Item-Level Tasks](../../reporting-services/security/tasks-and-permissions-item-level-tasks.md). For more information about tasks and permissions in general, see [Tasks and Permissions](../../reporting-services/security/tasks-and-permissions.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you are working with these tasks programmatically, you must use methods that support system-level tasks. For more information, see <xref:ReportService2010.ReportingService2010.ListTasks%2A> and <xref:ReportService2010.ReportingService2010.ListRoles%2A>.
