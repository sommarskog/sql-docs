# Upload Files to a Folder
  You can upload files from the file system and store them as managed items in a report server database. What happens when you upload a file depends on the file type.  
  
-   Uploading an .rdl file is equivalent to publishing a report.  
  
-   Uploading any other file adds it to the report server database as a single binary object. These files are published to a report server as a resource. Resources can be any file type. If the file extension matches a known MIME type, an icon for that MIME type is used to identify the resource type. Otherwise, a generic file icon indicates a resource.  
  
    >[!NOTE]  
    >You cannot upload a report data source (.rds) file to create a shared data source. An .rds file is used only in Report Designer. It cannot provide the content for a shared data source item that you define and manage through the web portal. As an alternative to uploading, you can write a script that creates a shared data source based on a .rds file.  
  
 The maximum file size for uploaded items is 2 GB, and can be set using the MaxFileSizeMb property in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)].  
  
 Visually, files that you upload to a report server database are represented in the folder hierarchy with the following icons.  
  
  ![Report Server uploadable file icons](../../reporting-services/report-server/media/upload-files-to-a-folder/report-server-uploadable-file-icons.png)
  
 When you upload a file, it is always placed in the folder that is currently selected. You can navigate to the folder that you want to contain the item first, or you can upload a file and then move it to a final location later.  
  
 To upload a file, use the web portal. Whether you can upload files to a report server depends on tasks that are part of your role assignment. If you are using default security, local administrators can add items to a report server. If My Reports is enabled, any user who has a My Reports folder has permission to upload items to that folder. If you use custom role assignments, the role assignment must include tasks that support folder management.
