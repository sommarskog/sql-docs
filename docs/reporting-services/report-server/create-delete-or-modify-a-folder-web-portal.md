# Create, Delete, or Modify a Folder - Reporting Services
  You can create folders to organize and manage the items you publish to a report server. Creating folders can help users find reports of interest to them. For content managers, folders provide a framework for applying permissions. You can create role assignments on specific folders to restrict access to reports that are in development or that should not be widely distributed.
