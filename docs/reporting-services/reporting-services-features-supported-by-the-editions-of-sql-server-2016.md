## Edition requirements for the report server database
 When you create a report server database, not all editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can be used to host the database. The following table shows you which editions of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] you can use for specific editions of SQL Server [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].  
  
|For this edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Reporting Services or Power BI Report Server,|Use this edition of the Database Engine instance to host the database.|  
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|Power BI Premium (for Power BI Report Server)|Enterprise or Standard editions (local or remote)|  
|Enterprise (including Enterprise Software Assurance)|Enterprise or Standard editions (local or remote)|  
|Standard|Enterprise or Standard editions (local or remote)|  
|Web|Web edition (local only)|  
|Express with Advanced Services|Express with Advanced Services (local only)|  
|Evaluation|Evaluation|
|Developer|Developer|
  
##  <a name="BIC"></a> Business intelligence clients  
The following software client applications are available on the Microsoft Download Center. They help you create business intelligence documents that run on a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. When you host these documents in a server environment, use an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that supports that document type. The following table identifies which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition contains the server features required to host the documents created in these client applications.  
  
|Tool name|Enterprise|Standard|Web|Express with Advanced Services|Developer|  
|---------------|----------------|--------------|------------------------|-------------|---------------| 
| Power BI Desktop optimized for Power BI Report Server, **.pbix** | Yes, with Software Assurance | | | | Yes |
|[!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../includes/ssrbnoversion.md)], **.rdl** and **.rds**|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|  
|[!INCLUDE[SS_MobileReptPub_Long](../includes/ss-mobilereptpub-long.md)], **.rsmobile**|Yes||||Yes|  
|Power BI apps for mobile devices (iOS, Windows, and Android), **.rsmobile**|Yes||||Yes|  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> * The preceding table identifies the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] editions that are required to enable these client tools. However, these tools can access data hosted on any edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
> * [!INCLUDE[SS_MobileReptPub_Long](../includes/ss-mobilereptpub-long.md)] is the single point for creation of mobile reports. Connect to an SSRS server to access data sources and create reports. Then publish them to the SSRS server for others in the organization to access, either on the server or on mobile devices. You can also use [!INCLUDE[SS_MobileReptPub_Long](../includes/ss-mobilereptpub-long.md)] stand alone with local data sources. However, SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher is deprecated for all releases of SQL Server Reporting Services after SQL Server Reporting Services 2019.
> * Whether you use [!INCLUDE[ssRSCurrent](../includes/ssrscurrent-md.md)] on-premises, [!INCLUDE[sspowerbi](../includes/sspowerbi-md.md)] in the cloud, or both as your report delivery solution, you only need one mobile app to access dashboards and mobile reports on mobile devices. The [!INCLUDE[sspowerbi](../includes/sspowerbi-md.md)] apps are available for download from the Windows, iOS, or Android app stores.
