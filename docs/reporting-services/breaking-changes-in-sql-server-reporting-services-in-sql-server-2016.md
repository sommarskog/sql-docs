[!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto](../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-2016](../includes/ssrs-appliesto-2016.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-not-2017](../includes/ssrs-appliesto-not-2017.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-not-pbirs](../includes/ssrs-appliesto-not-pbirs.md)]

[!INCLUDE [ssrs-previous-versions](../includes/ssrs-previous-versions.md)]

This topic describes breaking changes in [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. These changes might break applications, scripts, or functionalities that are based on earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You might encounter these issues when you upgrade, or in custom scripts or reports.

## Security Extensions

Custom security extensions need some modification to work with the new [!INCLUDE[ssRSWebPortal](../includes/ssrswebportal.md)]. Security extensions need to use the IAuthenticationExtension2 interface.

## WMI Provider

The [!INCLUDE[ssRSWebPortal](../includes/ssrswebportal.md)] application name changes from "ReportManager" to "ReportServerWebApp".
