# Set default options for Report Builder

  In Report Builder, you can set a number of useful defaults to make report authoring easier and faster.  For example, if you can set or change the default report server, Report Builder saves your reports to the same report server automatically, unless you specify otherwise.

- In Report Builder, select **File** > **Options**.

## UI element list

**Use this report server or SharePoint site by default**  
Your administrator may have configured this setting. The value can be a well-formed URL starting with http:// or https://. This setting determines which data source connections appear by default in the Table/Matrix and Chart wizards. In addition, your reports are processed on this server and you can reference resources from this server.

If you select a different report server, you may need to restart Report Builder in order for this change to take effect.

**Publish report parts to this folder by default**  
Report Builder saves report parts that you publish to this folder. If the folder does not exist yet and you have permissions to create folders on the report server, Report Builder creates this folder.

You do not need to restart Report Builder for this setting to take effect.

**Show this number of recent shared datasets and data source connections**

**Show this number of recent documents**  
Specify the number of recent documents to show when you select the Report Builder button.
