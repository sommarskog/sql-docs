# Keyboard shortcuts for accessibility in paginated reports in Report Builder

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb.md)]

When you create and edit paginated reports in [Microsoft Report Builder](../../reporting-services/report-builder/report-builder-in-sql-server-2016.md) for Reporting Services and in [Power BI Report Builder](/power-bi/paginated-reports/report-builder-power-bi), you can use keyboard shortcuts for accessibility and navigation. You can select from several standard keyboard mapping schemes.

You can navigate through the Report Builder window, or select and change options in dialog boxes, without using the mouse.

Report Builder provides many right-click menus for quick access to frequently used dialog boxes and commands. Right-click menus are dynamic and may contain different options, depending on the user configuration and the current objects. As you explore Report Builder, make sure you right-click objects to explore the menu options and learn about these shortcuts.

> [!NOTE]  
> Keyboard shortcuts can contain the SHIFT, ALT, and/or CTRL keys in combination with letters, or use function keys. For example, F1 opens the Report Builder Help file.
