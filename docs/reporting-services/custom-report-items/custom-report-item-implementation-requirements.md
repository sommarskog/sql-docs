# Custom Report Item Implementation Requirements
  This topic will discuss the prerequisites for developing and deploying custom report items.  
  
## Development and Deployment Requirements  
 Developing a custom report item for [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] requires the following:  
  
-   Administrative access to a server running [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vsprvs2005](../../includes/vsprvs2005-md.md)] or above with the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] software development kit (SDK) installed.  
  
-   Access to the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] SDK documentation.  
  
-   Familiarity with component authoring and the component model namespaces in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
## Language and Namespace Requirements  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] custom report items fully support the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. You can develop custom report items using your choice of .NET-compliant languages.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] offers the developer many tools and features to simplify and accelerate the iterative cycles of coding, debugging, and testing and to make deployment easier. The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] SDK includes [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] and C# compilers and related tools.  
  
-   Custom report items use the **Microsoft.ReportDesigner** and <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces> namespaces. These are stored in the Microsoft.ReportingServices.Designer.DLL and Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.DLL assemblies, which are installed as part of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   Custom report item design-time components need to implement interfaces from the <xref:System.ComponentModel> namespace in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. The <xref:System.ComponentModel> is documented in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] SDK documentation.
