# Add HTML into a paginated report (Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes](../../includes/ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes.md)]

  Using a placeholder, you can import HTML from a field in your dataset for use in the paginated report. By default, a placeholder represents plain text, so you will need to change the placeholder mark-up type to HTML. For more information, see [Importing HTML into a Report &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/importing-html-into-a-report-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).

### To add HTML from a field in your dataset into a text box  
  
1.  On the **Insert** tab, click **List**. Click the design surface, and then drag to create a box that is the size you want.  
  
     The **Dataset Properties** dialog box opens. You can use a shared dataset or a dataset embedded in your report. For more information, click [Dataset Properties Dialog Box, Query &#40;Report Builder&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-data/dataset-properties-dialog-box-query-report-builder.md) or [Dataset Properties Dialog Box, Query](/previous-versions/sql/).  
  
2.  On the **Insert** tab, click **Text Box**. Click in the list, and then drag to create a box that is the size you want.  
  
3.  Drag an HTML field from your dataset into the text box. A placeholder is created for your field.  
  
4.  Right-click the placeholder, and then click **Placeholder Properties**.  
  
5.  On the **General** tab, verify that the **Value** box contains an expression that evaluates to the field you dropped in step 3.  
  
6.  Click **HTML - Interpret HTML tags as styles**. This causes the field to be evaluated as HTML.  
  
7.  Select **OK**.
