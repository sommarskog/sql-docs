# Format paginated report items (Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes](../../includes/ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes.md)]

  Formatting the items in your paginated reports makes them look more attractive and enhances readability. You can format the text boxes and individual items within text boxes, the images, the expressions, and the data while in report design mode.

 You can change formatting options by selecting the item that you want to format and then opening the item's Properties dialog box.

Then, you can apply the formatting styles that you want.
