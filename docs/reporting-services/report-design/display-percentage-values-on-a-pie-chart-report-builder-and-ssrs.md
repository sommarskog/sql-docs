# Display percentage values on pie chart in a paginated report (Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes](../../includes/ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes.md)]

In paginated reports, by default the legend shows categories. You may also want percentages in the legend or the pie slices themselves.

 The [Tutorial: Add a Pie Chart to Your Report (Report Builder)](../tutorial-add-a-pie-chart-to-your-report-report-builder.md) walks you through adding percentages to pie slices, if you'd like to try this with sample data first.
 
  
## To display percentage values as labels on a pie chart  
  
1.  Add a pie chart to your report. For more information, see [Add a Chart to a Report &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/add-a-chart-to-a-report-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
2.  On the design surface, right-click on the pie and select **Show Data Labels**. The data labels should appear within each slice on the pie chart.  
  
3.  On the design surface, right-click on the labels and select **Series Label Properties**. The **Series Label Properties** dialog box appears.  
  
4.  Type **#PERCENT** for the **Label data** option.  
  
5.  (Optional) To specify how many decimal places the label shows, type "#PERCENT{P*n*}" where *n* is the number of decimal places to display. For example, to display no decimal places, type "#PERCENT{P0}".  
  
## To display percentage values in the legend of a pie chart  
  
1.  On the design surface, right-click on the pie chart and select **Series Properties**. The **Series Properties** dialog box displays.  
  
2.  In **Legend**, type **#PERCENT** for the **Custom legend text** property.
