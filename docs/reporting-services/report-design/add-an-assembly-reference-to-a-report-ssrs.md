# Add an assembly reference to a paginated report (Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes](../../includes/ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes.md)]

  When you embed custom code that contains references to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] classes that are not in <xref:System.Math> or <xref:System.Convert>, you must provide an assembly reference to the report so that the report processor can resolve the names. For more information, see [Add Code to a Report &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/add-code-to-a-report-ssrs.md).  
  
### To add an assembly reference to a report  
  
1.  In **Design** view, right-click the design surface outside the border of the report and click **Report Properties**.  
  
2.  Click **References**.  
  
3.  In **Add or remove assemblies**, click **Add** and then click the ellipsis button to browse to the assembly.  
  
4.  In **Add or remove classes**, click **Add** and then type name of the class and provide an instance name to use within the report.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Specify a class and instance name only for instance-based members. Do not specify static members in the **Classes** list. For more information, see [Custom Code and Assembly References in Expressions in Report Designer &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/custom-code-and-assembly-references-in-expressions-in-report-designer-ssrs.md).  
  
5.  Select **OK**.
