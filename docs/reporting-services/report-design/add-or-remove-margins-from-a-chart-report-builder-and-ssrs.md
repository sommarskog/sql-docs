# Add or remove margins from a paginated report chart (Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes](../../includes/ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes.md)]

For Column and Scatter chart types in paginated reports, the chart automatically adds side margins on the ends of the x-axis. In Bar chart types, the chart automatically adds side margins on the ends of the y-axis. In all other chart types, the chart does not add side margins. You cannot change the size of the margin.  
  
 This topic does not apply to pie, doughnut, funnel, or pyramid chart types.

## To enable or disable side margins  
  
1.  Right-click the axis and select **Axis Properties**. The **Vertical** or **HorizontalAxis Properties** dialog box appears.  
  
2.  On the **Axis Options** page, set the **Side margins** property:  
  
    -   **Auto** The chart will determine whether to add a side margin based on the chart type.  
  
    -   **Disabled** Bar, column, and scatter charts will have no side margins.  
  
3.  Select **OK**.
