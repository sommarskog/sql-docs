# Start pie chart values at the top of the pie in a paginated report (Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes](../../includes/ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes.md)]

In pie charts in paginated reports, by default the first value in the dataset starts at 90 degrees from the top of the pie.

*Chart values start at 90 degrees.*

You might want the first value to start at the top instead.

*Chart values start at the top of the chart.*
  
## To Start the Pie Chart at the Top of the Pie  
  
1.  Click the pie itself.  
  
2.  If the **Properties** pane is not open, on the **View** tab, click **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **Properties** pane, under **Custom Attributes**, change **PieStartAngle** from **0** to **270**.  
  
4.  Click **Run** to preview your report.  
  
 The first value now starts at the top of the pie chart.
