A SQL Server Reporting Services report server installed in SharePoint mode requires a version of SharePoint and the SQL Server Reporting Services add-in (rsSharePoint.msi) for SharePoint products, which you install on the SharePoint servers. This topic summarizes the supported combinations.

> [!NOTE]
> Reporting Services integration with SharePoint is no longer available after SQL Server 2016. To add a report within a SharePoint site using SQL Server Reporting Services 2017 and later, use the [Report Viewer web part](../../reporting-services/report-server-sharepoint/report-viewer-web-part-sharepoint-site.md). Power View support is no longer available after SQL Server 2017.

 *Exception: Power view integration isn't supported.

 For links to the add-in download pages, see [Where to find the Reporting Services add-in for SharePoint Products](../../reporting-services/install-windows/where-to-find-the-reporting-services-add-in-for-sharepoint-products.md).  

 **Additional considerations:**

- Be sure to upgrade all of the SharePoint servers within the farm. This includes the App and Web Front End servers.

- SharePoint 2016 support, including Power view integration, requires the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report server and the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in version of SQL Server 2016 or later.

- SharePoint 2013 support, including Power view integration, requires the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report server and the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in version of SQL Server 2012 SP1 or later.

- Power View was introduced in SQL Server 2012. Therefore, Power View integration with SharePoint 2010 requires the SQL Server 2012 or later of the add-in.

- The SQL Server 2008 R2 Add-In isn't supported by SQL Server 2012 (or later) report servers. The SharePoint 2010 prerequisite installer automatically installs the SQL Server 2008 R2 Add-In. It must be uninstalled before installing newer versions of the add-in. In place upgrade of the add-in isn't supported.

- **Upgrade:** SharePoint 2010 with the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Add-In installed, cannot be upgraded in-place to SharePoint 2013. SharePoint 2013 requires SQL Server 2012 SP1 or later of the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] add-in and report server. For more information on upgrade, see [Upgrade and Migrate Reporting Services](../../reporting-services/install-windows/upgrade-and-migrate-reporting-services.md).
