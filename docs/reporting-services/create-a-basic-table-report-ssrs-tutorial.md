# Create a Basic Table Report (SSRS Tutorial)

In this tutorial, you use the *Report Designer* tool in Visual Studio / SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). You create a SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) paginated report. The report contains a query table, created from data in the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.

As you progress in this tutorial, you're going to learn how to:
  
- create a report project.
- set up a data connection.
- define a query.
- add a table data region.
- format the report.
- group and total fields.
- preview the report.
- optionally publish the report.

## Requirements

Your system must have the following components installed to take this tutorial:

- [!INCLUDE[msconame-md](../includes/msconame-md.md)] SQL Server database engine.  
- SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services or later (SSRS).
- The [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  For more information, see [Adventure Works Sample Databases](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases).
- [SQL Server Data Tools](../ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md) for Visual Studio along with the Reporting Services extension installed to enable access to the *Report Designer*.
  
You must also have read-only permissions to retrieve data from the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.

**Estimated time to complete the tutorial:** 30 minutes.
