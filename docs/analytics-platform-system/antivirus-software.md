# Antivirus software for Analytics Platform System

If your datacenter requires antivirus software, use these guidelines to install antivirus software on Analytics Platform System. We recommend not installing antivirus software unless it's a firm requirement of your datacenter.

> [!WARNING]
>
> We strongly recommend that you individually assess the security risk for each computer and for Analytics Platform System as a whole, and that you select the tools that are appropriate for the security risk level of each computer. Additionally, we recommend that before you roll out any virus-protection project, you test the whole system under a full load to measure any changes in stability and performance.
>
> Virus protection software requires some system resources to execute. You must perform testing before and after you install your antivirus software to determine whether there is any performance effect on the Analytics Platform System.

This article is based on the guidance in [How to choose antivirus software to run on computers that are running SQL Server](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309422) and [KB Article 961804](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/961804/en-us).
