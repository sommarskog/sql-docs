# Admin Console alerts in Analytics Platform System

Alerts for Analytics Platform System appear in the Admin Console appliance and in System Center Operations Manager. Use the list in this article to identify which alerts require investigation.
  
For information about connecting to the Admin Console by using Internet Explorer, see [Monitor the appliance by using the Admin Console (Analytics Platform System)](monitor-the-appliance-by-using-the-admin-console.md). For information about Operations Manager, see [Monitor the appliance by using System Center Operations Manager (Analytics Platform System)](monitor-the-appliance-by-using-system-center-operations-manager.md).
  
For information about obtaining alert information by using Transact\-SQL, see [Monitor the appliance by using system views (Analytics Platform System)](monitor-the-appliance-by-using-system-views.md).
  
## Types of alerts

Alert names that indicate a **NORMAL** status don't usually require investigation. Alert names that contain **NON-CRITICAL** sometimes require action. Investigation is required for all other types of alerts.
  
## Alert list

The following table lists alerts alphabetically by name. The list doesn't include all possible alerts. The wording of some alerts varies slightly for different vendors.
