Follow these steps to configure the System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) Management Packs for Analytics Platform System. The Management Packs are required to monitor Analytics Platform System from SCOM.  
  
## <a name="BeforeBegin"></a>Before You Begin  
**Prerequisites**  
  
System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2 must be installed and running.  
  
The management packs must be installed and configured.
