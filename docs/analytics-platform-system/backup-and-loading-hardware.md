To backup a PDW database, you need one or more backup servers. You can use your own existing hardware or purchase new hardware. For more information, see [Acquire and Configure a Backup Server](acquire-and-configure-backup-server.md). These instructions include a [Backup server capacity planning worksheet](backup-capacity-planning-worksheet.md) to help you plan the right solution for backup.
