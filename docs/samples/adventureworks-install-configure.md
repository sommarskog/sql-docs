# AdventureWorks sample databases

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

This article provides direct links to download `AdventureWorks` sample databases, and instructions for restoring them to SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Managed Instance.

For more information about samples, see the [Samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases).

## Prerequisites

- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2022) or [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/)
- [SQL Server Management Studio](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md) (SSMS) or [Azure Data Studio](../azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio.md)

## Download backup files

Use these links to download the appropriate sample database for your scenario.

- **OLTP** data is for most typical online transaction processing workloads.
- **Data Warehouse (DW)** data is for data warehousing workloads.
- **Lightweight (LT)** data is a lightweight and pared down version of the **OLTP** sample.

If you're not sure what you need, start with the OLTP version that matches your SQL Server version.

## Restore to SQL Server

You can use the `.bak` file to restore your sample database to your [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. You can do so using the [RESTORE (Transact-SQL)](../t-sql/statements/restore-statements-transact-sql.md) command, or using the graphical interface (GUI) in [SQL Server Management Studio](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md) (SSMS) or [Azure Data Studio](../azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio.md).

# [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](#tab/ssms)

If you're not familiar using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), you can see [connect & query](../ssms/quickstarts/ssms-connect-query-sql-server.md) to get started.

To restore your database in SSMS, follow these steps:

1. Download the appropriate `.bak` file from one of links provided in the [download backup files](#download-backup-files) section.
1. Move the `.bak` file to your [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] backup location. This varies depending on your installation location, instance name and version of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For example, the default location for a default instance of [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] is:

   `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup`.

1. Open SSMS and connect to your [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.
1. Right-click **Databases** in **Object Explorer** > **Restore Database...** to launch the **Restore Database** wizard.

   :::image type="content" source="media/adventureworks-install-configure/restore-db-ssms.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to choose to restore your database by right-clicking databases in Object Explorer and then selecting Restore Database.":::

1. Select **Device** and then select the ellipses **(...)** to choose a device.
1. Select **Add** and then choose the `.bak` file you recently moved to the backup location. If you moved your file to this location but you're not able to see it in the wizard, this typically indicates a permissions issue - [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or the user signed into [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] doesn't have permission to this file in this folder.
1. Select **OK** to confirm your database backup selection and close the **Select backup devices** window.
1. Check the **Files** tab to confirm the **Restore as** location and file names match your intended location and file names in the **Restore Database** wizard.
1. Select **OK** to restore your database.

   :::image type="content" source="media/adventureworks-install-configure/restore-db-wizard-ssms.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Restore Database window with the backup set to restore highlighted and the OK option highlighted.":::

For more information on restoring a [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database, see [Restore a database backup using SSMS](../relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-a-database-backup-using-ssms.md).

# [Transact-SQL (T-SQL)](#tab/tsql)

You can restore your sample database using Transact-SQL (T-SQL). An example to restore [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] is provided below, but the database name and installation file path may vary depending on your environment.

To restore [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] on **Windows**, modify values as appropriate to your environment and then run the following Transact-SQL (T-SQL) command:

```sql
USE [master];
GO
RESTORE DATABASE [AdventureWorks2022]
FROM DISK = N'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup\AdventureWorks2022.bak'
WITH
    FILE = 1,
    NOUNLOAD,
    STATS = 5;
GO
```

To restore [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] on **Linux**, change the Windows filesystem path to Linux, and then run the following Transact-SQL (T-SQL) command:

```sql
USE [master];
GO
RESTORE DATABASE [AdventureWorks2022]
FROM DISK = '/var/opt/mssql/backup/AdventureWorks2022.bak'
WITH
    MOVE 'AdventureWorks2022' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/AdventureWorks2022.mdf',
    MOVE 'AdventureWorks2022_log' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/AdventureWorks2022_log.ldf',
    FILE = 1,
    NOUNLOAD,
    STATS = 5;
GO
```

# [Azure Data Studio](#tab/data-studio)

If you're not familiar using [Azure Data Studio Studio](../azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio.md), see [connect & query](../azure-data-studio/quickstart-sql-server.md) to get started

To restore your database in Azure Data Studio, follow these steps:

1. Download the appropriate `.bak` file from one of links provided in the [download backup files](#download-backup-files) section.
1. Move the `.bak` file to your [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] backup location. This varies depending on your installation location, instance name and version of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For example, the default location for a default instance of [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] is:

   `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup`.

1. Open Azure Data Studio and connect to your [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.
1. Right-click on your server and select **Manage**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/adventureworks-install-configure/ads-manage.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure Data Studio with the Manage option highlighted and called out.":::

1. Select **Restore**

   :::image type="content" source="media/adventureworks-install-configure/ads-restore-database.png" alt-text="Select restore from the top menu to restore your database.":::

1. On the **General** tab, fill in the values listed under **Source**.
   1. Under **Restore from**, select *Backup file*.
   1. Under **Backup file path**, select the location you stored the .bak file.

   :::image type="content" source="media/adventureworks-install-configure/ads-source.png" alt-text="Select your backup file path":::

   This auto-populates the rest of the fields such as **Database**, **Target database** and **Restore to**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/adventureworks-install-configure/ads-destination-restore-plan.png" alt-text="Once you have chosen a backup file path, the rest of the fields autopopulate":::

1. Select **Restore** to restore your database.

## Deploy to Azure SQL Database

You have two options to view sample Azure SQL Database data. You can use a sample when you create a new database, or you can deploy a database from [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] directly to Azure using SSMS.

To get sample data for Azure SQL Managed Instance instead, see [restore World Wide Importers to SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/restore-sample-database-quickstart).

### Deploy new sample database

When you create a new database in Azure SQL Database, you can create a blank database, restore from a backup or select sample data to populate your new database.

Follow these steps to add a sample data to your new database:

1. Connect to your Azure portal.
1. Select **Create a resource** in the top left of the navigation pane.
1. Select **Databases** and then select **SQL Database**.
1. Fill in the requested information to create your database.
1. On the **Additional settings** tab, choose **Sample** as the existing data under **Data source**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/adventureworks-install-configure/deploy-sample-to-azure.png" alt-text="Choose sample as the data source on the Additional settings tab in the Azure portal when creating your Azure SQL Database":::

1. Select **Create** to create your new SQL Database, which is the restored copy of the `AdventureWorksLT` database.

### Deploy database from SQL Server

SSMS allows you to deploy a database directly to Azure SQL Database. This method doesn't currently provide data validation so is intended for development and testing and shouldn't be used for production.

To deploy a sample database from [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to Azure SQL Database, follow these steps:

1. Connect to your [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in SSMS.
1. If you haven't already done so, [restore the sample database to SQL Server](#restore-to-sql-server).
1. Right-click your restored database in **Object Explorer** > **Tasks** > **Deploy Database to Microsoft Azure SQL Database...**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/adventureworks-install-configure/deploy-db-to-azure.png" alt-text="Choose to deploy your database to Microsoft Azure SQL Database from right-clicking your database and selecting Tasks":::

1. Follow the wizard to connect to Azure SQL Database and deploy your database.

## Creation scripts

Instead of restoring a database, alternatively, you can use scripts to create the `AdventureWorks` databases regardless of version.

The below scripts can be used to create the entire `AdventureWorks` database:

- [AdventureWorks OLTP Scripts Zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks-oltp-install-script.zip)
- [AdventureWorks DW Scripts Zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorksDW-data-warehouse-install-script.zip)

Additional information about using the scripts can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks).

## Next steps

Once you've restored your sample database, using the following tutorials to get started with [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:
