# Prerequisites for Using the ADO Documentation
To use this documentation, you should have, at a minimum, some experience developing applications with Microsoft Visual Basic, because most of the examples in the guide are written in this language. There are also some examples written in Microsoft Visual C++, Java, Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and Microsoft JScript.  
  
 Because ADO is used for accessing data from a variety of sources, you will also need some understanding of relational database management systems and online analytical processing (OLAP), and basic familiarity with the Internet and Internet protocols.  
  
 Because ADO and the related OLE DB technology are based on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM), knowledge of COM will help you to better understand advanced concepts in ADO.
