# Internet Server Error: Access Denied
If you get this error, it usually means that Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) returned the following status:  
  
 HTTP_STATUS_DENIED 401  
  
 Make sure the directories accessed by IIS have proper permissions. RDS can communicate with an IIS Web server running in any one of the three Password Authentication modes: Anonymous, Basic, or NT Challenge/Response (called Integrated Windows authentication in Windows 2000). Also, the Web server must have permissions to the data source computer if it is a Windows NT/Windows 2000 computer.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](/dotnet/framework/wcf/).
