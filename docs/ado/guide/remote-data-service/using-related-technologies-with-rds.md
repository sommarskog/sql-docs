# Using Related Technologies with RDS
This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Using RDS with ODBC Connection Pooling](./using-rds-with-odbc-connection-pooling.md)  
  
-   [Running Business Objects in Component Services](./running-business-objects-in-component-services.md)  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](/dotnet/framework/wcf/).  
  
 Many other technologies interact with Remote Data Service or are used in its implementation.
