# RDS API Reference
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](/dotnet/framework/wcf/).  
  
 This section of the ADO documentation contains reference topics for each RDS object, property, method, and event, as well as RDS code samples:  
  
-   [RDS Objects](./rds-objects.md)  
  
-   [RDS Properties](./rds-properties.md)  
  
-   [RDS Methods](./rds-methods.md)  
  
-   [RDS Events](./rds-events.md)  
  
-   [RDS Code Examples](./rds-code-examples.md)
