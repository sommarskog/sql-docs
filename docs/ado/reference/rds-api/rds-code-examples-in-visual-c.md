# RDS Code Examples in Visual C++
Use the following code examples to learn how to use RDS properties when writing in Microsoft Visual C++.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](/dotnet/framework/wcf/).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Paste the entire code example, from beginning to end, into your code editor. The example may not run correctly if partial examples are used or if paragraph formatting is lost.
