# Deploy an SSIS project from the command prompt with ISDeploymentWizard.exe

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


This quickstart demonstrates how to deploy an SSIS project from the command prompt by running the Integration Services Deployment Wizard, `ISDeploymentWizard.exe`.

For more info about the Integration Services Deployment Wizard, see [Integration Services Deployment Wizard](packages/deploy-integration-services-ssis-projects-and-packages.md#integration-services-deployment-wizard).

## Prerequisites

The validation described in this article for deployment to Azure SQL Database requires SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) version 17.4 or later. To get the latest version of SSDT, see [Download SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](../ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md).

An Azure SQL Database server listens on port 1433. If you're trying to connect to an Azure SQL Database server from within a corporate firewall, this port must be open in the corporate firewall for you to connect successfully.

## Supported platforms

You can use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS project to the following platforms:

-   SQL Server on Windows.

-   Azure SQL Database. For more info about deploying and running packages in Azure, see [Lift and shift SQL Server Integration Services workloads to the cloud](lift-shift/ssis-azure-lift-shift-ssis-packages-overview.md).

You cannot use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS package to SQL Server on Linux. For more info about running packages on Linux, see [Extract, transform, and load data on Linux with SSIS](../linux/sql-server-linux-migrate-ssis.md).

## For Azure SQL Database, get the connection info

To deploy the project to Azure SQL Database, get the connection information you need to connect to the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB). You need the fully qualified server name and login information in the procedures that follow.

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **SQL Databases** from the left-hand menu, and then select the SSISDB database on the **SQL databases** page. 
3. On the **Overview** page for your database, review the fully qualified server name. To see the **Click to copy** option, hover over the server name. 
4. If you forget your Azure SQL Database server login information, navigate to the SQL Database server page to view the server admin name. You can reset the password if necessary.

## Supported authentication method

Refer to [authentication methods for deployment](ssis-quickstart-deploy-ssms.md#authentication-methods-for-deployment).

## Start the Integration Services Deployment Wizard
1. Open a Command Prompt window.

2. Run `ISDeploymentWizard.exe`. The Integration Services Deployment Wizard opens.

    If the folder that contains `ISDeploymentWizard.exe` is not in your `path` environment variable, you may have to use the `cd` command to change to its directory. For SQL Server 2017, this folder is typically `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\140\DTS\Binn`.

## Deploy a project with the wizard
1. On the **Introduction** page of the wizard, review the introduction. Click **Next** to open the **Select Source** page.

2. On the **Select Source** page, select the existing SSIS project to deploy.
    -   To deploy a project deployment file that you created by building a project in the development environment, select **Project deployment file** and enter the path to the .ispac file.
    -   To deploy a project that is already deployed to an SSIS catalog database, select **Integration Services catalog**, and then enter the server name and the path to the project in the catalog.
    Click **Next** to see the **Select Destination** page.
  
3.  On the **Select Destination** page, select the destination for the project.
    -   Enter the fully qualified server name. If the target server is an Azure SQL Database server, the name is in this format `<server_name>.database.windows.net`.
    -   Provide authentication information, and then select **Connect**. See [authentication methods for deployment](ssis-quickstart-deploy-ssms.md#authentication-methods-for-deployment) in this article.
    -   Then select **Browse** to select the target folder in SSISDB.
    -   Then select **Next** to open the **Review** page. (The **Next** button is enabled only after you select **Connect**.)

4.  On the **Review** page, review the settings you selected.
    -   You can change your selections by clicking **Previous**, or by clicking any of the steps in the left pane.
    -   Click **Deploy** to start the deployment process.

5.  If you're deploying to an Azure SQL Database server, the **Validate** page opens and checks the packages in the project for known issues that may prevent the packages from running as expected in the Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime. For more info, see [Validate SSIS packages deployed to Azure](lift-shift/ssis-azure-validate-packages.md).

6.  After the deployment process is complete, the **Results** page opens. This page displays the success or failure of each action.
    -   If the action failed, click **Failed** in the **Result** column to display an explanation of the error.
    -   Optionally, click **Save Report...** to save the results to an XML file.
    -   Click **Close** to exit the wizard.
