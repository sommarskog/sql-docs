# Delete Packages

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], you can delete packages saved to the file system. If you delete a package, it is deleted permanently and it cannot be restored to an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to remove packages from an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project, but use them in other projects, then you should use the **Exclude From Project** option instead of the **Delete** option.  
  
### To delete a package in Business Intelligence

2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the package, and then click **Delete**.  
  
3.  Click **OK** to confirm the deletion or click **Cancel** to keep the package.
