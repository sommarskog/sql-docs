# Deploy Packages with SSIS

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] provides tools that make it easy to deploy packages to another computer. The deployment tools also manage any dependencies, such as configurations and files that the package needs. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use these tools to install packages and their dependencies on a target computer.    
    
First, you will perform tasks to prepare for deployment. You will create a new [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] and add existing packages and data files to the project. You will not create any new packages from scratch; instead, you will work only with completed packages that were created just for this tutorial. You will not modify the functionality of the packages in this tutorial; however, after you have added the packages to the project, you might find it useful to open the packages in [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer and review the contents of each package. By examining the packages, you will learn about package dependencies such as log files and about other interesting features of the packages.    
    
In preparation for deployment, you will also update the packages to use configurations. Configurations make the properties of packages and package objects updatable at run time. In this tutorial, you will use configurations to update the connection strings of log and text files and the locations of the XML and XSD files that the package uses. For more information, see [Package Configurations](./packages/legacy-package-deployment-ssis.md) and [Create Package Configurations](./packages/legacy-package-deployment-ssis.md).    
    
After you have verified that the packages run successfully in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], you will create the deployment bundle to use to install the packages. The deployment bundle will consist of the package files and other items that you added to the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project, the package dependencies that [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] automatically includes, and the deployment utility that you built. For more information, see [Create a Deployment Utility](./packages/legacy-package-deployment-ssis.md).    
    
You will then copy the deployment bundle to the target computer and run the Package Installation Wizard to install the packages and package dependencies. The packages will be installed in the msdb SQL Server database, and the supporting and ancillary files will be installed in the file system. Because the deployed packages use configurations, you will update the configuration to use new values that enable packages to run successfully in the new environment.    
    
Finally, you will run the packages in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] by using the Execute Package Utility.    
    
It is the goal of this tutorial to simulate the complexity of real-life deployment issues that you may encounter. However, if it is not possible for you to deploy the packages to a different computer, you can still do this tutorial by installing the packages in the msdb database on a local instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and then running the packages from [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] on the same instance.    

**Estimated time to complete this tutorial:** 2 hours

## What You Learn    
The best way to become acquainted with the new tools, controls, and features available in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] is to use them. This tutorial walks you through the steps to create an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project and then add the packages and other necessary files to the project. After the project is complete, you will create a deployment bundle, copy the bundle to the destination computer, and then install the packages on the destination computer.    
    
## Prerequisites    
This tutorial is intended for users who are already familiar with fundamental file system operations, but who have limited exposure to the new features available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]. To better understand basic [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] concepts that you will put to use in this tutorial, you might find it useful to first complete the following [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] tutorial: [SSIS How to Create an ETL Package](../integration-services/ssis-how-to-create-an-etl-package.md).    
    
### On the source computer

The computer on which you create the deployment bundle **must have the following components installed:**

- SQL Server. (Download a free evaluation or developer edition of SQL Server from [SQL Server downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).)

- Sample data, completed packages, configurations, and a Readme. To download the sample data and the lesson packages as a Zip file, see [SQL Server Integration Services Tutorial Files](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56827). Most of the files in the Zip file are read-only to prevent unintended changes. To write output to a file or to change it, you may have to turn off the read-only attribute in the file properties.

-   The [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] sample database. You can download the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database from [AdventureWorks sample databases](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks) and restore the backup.  

-   You must have permission to create and drop tables in the AdventureWorks database.
    
-   [SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](../ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md).    
    
### On the destination computer

The computer to which you deploy packages **must have the following components installed:**    
    
- SQL Server. (Download a free evaluation or developer edition of SQL Server from [SQL Server downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).)

- Sample data, completed packages, configurations, and a Readme. To download the sample data and the lesson packages as a Zip file, see [SQL Server Integration Services Tutorial Files](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56827). Most of the files in the Zip file are read-only to prevent unintended changes. To write output to a file or to change it, you may have to turn off the read-only attribute in the file properties.

-   The [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] sample database. You can download the [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database from [AdventureWorks sample databases](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks) and restore the backup.  
    
- [SQL Server Management Studio](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).    
    
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]. To install SSIS, see [Install Integration Services](install-windows/install-integration-services.md).
    
-   You must have permission to create and drop tables in the AdventureWorks database, and to run SSIS packages in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].    
    
-   You must have read and write permission on the `sysssispackages` table in the `msdb` [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system database.    
    
If you plan to deploy packages to the same computer as the one on which you create the deployment bundle, that computer must meet requirements for both the source and destination computers.
