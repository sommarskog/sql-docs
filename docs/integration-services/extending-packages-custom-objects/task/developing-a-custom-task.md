# Developing a Custom Task

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] uses tasks to perform units of work in support of the extraction, transformation, and loading of data. [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] includes a variety of tasks that perform the most frequently used actions, from executing an SQL statement to downloading a file from an FTP site. If the included tasks and supported actions do not completely meet your requirements, you can create a custom task.  
  
 To create a custom task, you have to create a class that inherits from the [Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Task](/dotnet/api/microsoft.sqlserver.dts.runtime.task) base class, apply the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DtsTaskAttribute> attribute to your new class, and override the important methods and properties of the base class, including the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Task.Execute%2A> method.
