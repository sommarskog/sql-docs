# Complete the Wizard (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


After you specify whether you want to run the copy operation immediately, and after you optionally save the package that the wizard created, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard shows **Complete the Wizard**. On this page, you review the choices that you made in the wizard, and then click **Finish** to start the copy operation.
 
## Screen shot of the Complete the Wizard page 
 The following screen shot shows a simple example of the **Complete the Wizard** page of the wizard.

-   The data to copy.

## What's next?
