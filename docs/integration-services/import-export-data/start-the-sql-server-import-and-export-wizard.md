# Start the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]

Start the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard in one of the ways that is described in this topic to import data from and export data to any supported data source.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic describes only how to **start** the wizard. If you're looking for something else, see [Related tasks and content](#related-tasks-and-content).

You can start the wizard:

- From the [Start menu](#start-menu).
- From the [command prompt](#command-prompt).
- From [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](#sql-server-management-studio-ssms).
- From [Visual Studio with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](#visual-studio).

## Prerequisite - Is the wizard installed on your computer?

If you want to run the wizard, but you don't have [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installed on your computer, you can install the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard  by installing SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). For more info, see [Download SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](../../ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To use the 64-bit version of the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard, you have to install SQL Server. SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) are 32-bit applications and only install 32-bit files, including the 32-bit version of the wizard.

## Start menu

### Start the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard from the Start menu

1. On the **Start** menu, find and expand **Microsoft SQL Server 20xx**.
2. Click one of the following options.
    - **SQL Server 20xx Import and Export Data (64-bit)**
    - **SQL Server 20xx Import and Export Data (32-bit)**

    Run the 64-bit version of the wizard unless you know that your data source requires a 32-bit data provider.

## Command prompt

### Start the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard from the command prompt

In a Command Prompt window, run **DTSWizard.exe** from one of the following locations.

- **C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\140\DTS\Binn** for the 64-bit version.
  - *140* = SQL Server 2017.  This value depends on the version of SQL Server you have.

- **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\140\DTS\Binn** for the 32-bit version.
  - *140* = SQL Server 2017.  This value depends on the version of SQL Server you have.

Run the 64-bit version of the wizard unless you know that your data source requires a 32-bit data provider.
