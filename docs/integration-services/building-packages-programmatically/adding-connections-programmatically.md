# Add Connections Programmatically

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]

  The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> class represents physical connections to external data sources. The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> class isolates the implementation details of the connection from the runtime. This enables the runtime to interact with each connection manager consistently and predictably. Connection managers contain stock properties that all connections have in common, such as the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Name%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.ID%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Description%2A>, and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.ConnectionString%2A>. However, the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.ConnectionString%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Name%2A> properties are ordinarily the only properties required to configure a connection manager. Unlike other programming paradigms, where connection classes expose methods such as **Open** or **Connect** to establish a connection to the data source physically, the run-time engine manages all the connections for the package while it runs.

The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Connections> class is a collection of the connection managers that have been added to that package and are available for use at run time. You can add more connection managers to the collection using the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Connections.Add%2A> method of the collection, and supplying a string that indicates the connection manager type. The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Connections.Add%2A> method returns the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> instance that was added to the package.

## Intrinsic Properties

The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> class exposes a set of properties common to all connections. However, sometimes you need access to properties unique to the specific connection type. The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Properties%2A> collection of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> class provides access to these properties. The properties can be retrieved from the collection using the indexer or the property name and the **GetValue** method, and the values are set using the **SetValue** method. The properties of the underlying connection object properties can also be set by acquiring an actual instance of the object and setting its properties directly. To get the underlying connection, use the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.InnerObject%2A> property of the connection manager. The following line of code shows a C# line that creates an ADO.NET connection manager with the underlying class, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Wrapper.ConnectionManagerAdoNetClass>.

`ConnectionManagerAdoNetClass cmado = cm.InnerObject as ConnectionManagerAdoNet;`

This casts the managed connection manager object to its underlying connection object. If you use C++, the **QueryInterface** method of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager> object is called and the interface of the underlying connection object is requested.

The following table lists the connection managers included with [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]. and the string that is used in the `package.Connections.Add("xxx")` statement. For a list of all connection managers, see [Integration Services (SSIS) Connections](../../integration-services/connection-manager/integration-services-ssis-connections.md).

| String | Connection manager |
| --- | --- |
| "OLEDB" | Connection manager for OLE DB connections. |
| "ODBC" | Connection manager for ODBC connections. |
| "ADO" | Connection manager for ADO connections. |
| "ADO.NET:SQL" | Connection manager for ADO.NET (SQL data provider) connections. |
| "ADO.NET:OLEDB" | Connection manager for ADO.NET (OLE DB data provider) connections. |
| "FLATFILE" | Connection manager for flat file connections. |
| "FILE" | Connection manager for file connections. |
| "MULTIFLATFILE" | Connection manager for multiple flat file connections. |
| "MULTIFILE" | Connection manager for multiple file connections. |
| "SQLMOBILE" | Connection manager for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Compact connections. |
| "MSOLAP100" | Connection manager for [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] connections. |
| "FTP" | Connection manager for FTP connections. |
| "HTTP" | Connection manager for HTTP connections. |
| "MSMQ" | Connection manager for Message Queuing (also known as MSMQ) connections. |
| "SMTP" | Connection manager for SMTP connections. |
| "WMI" | Connection manager for Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) connections. |

The following code example demonstrates adding an OLE DB and FILE connection to the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Package.Connections%2A> collection of a <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Package>. The example then sets the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.ConnectionString%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Name%2A>, and <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.ConnectionManager.Description%2A> properties.

**Sample Output:**

`Connection description: OLE DB connection to the AdventureWorks database.`

`Connection description: Flat File connection.`
