In this task, you create a copy of the Lesson 2.dtsx package from Lesson 2. If you didn't complete Lesson 2, you can add the completed lesson 2 package included with this tutorial to the project, and then copy it instead. You use this new copy throughout the rest of Lesson 3.

7.  In the **Properties** window, change the **Name** property to **Lesson 3**.

8.  Select the box for the **ID** property, select the drop-down arrow, and then select **\<Generate New ID>**.

## Add the completed Lesson 2 package

3.  In the **Add Copy of Existing Package** dialog, in **Package location**, select **File system**.
