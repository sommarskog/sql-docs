# Deploy an SSIS project from Visual Studio Code with Transact-SQL

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


This quickstart demonstrates how to use Visual Studio Code to connect to the SSIS Catalog database, and then use Transact-SQL statements to deploy an SSIS project to the SSIS Catalog.

Visual Studio Code is a code editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux that supports extensions, including the `mssql` extension for connecting to Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or Azure Synapse Analytics. For more info about VS Code, see [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have installed the latest version of Visual Studio Code and loaded the `mssql` extension. To download these tools, see the following pages:
-   [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
-   [mssql extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql)

## Supported platforms

You can use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS project to the following platforms:

-   SQL Server on Windows.

You cannot use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS package to Azure SQL Database. The `catalog.deploy_project` stored procedure expects path to the `.ispac` file in the local (on premises) file system. For more info about deploying and running packages in Azure, see [Lift and shift SQL Server Integration Services workloads to the cloud](lift-shift/ssis-azure-lift-shift-ssis-packages-overview.md).

You cannot use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS package to SQL Server on Linux. For more info about running packages on Linux, see [Extract, transform, and load data on Linux with SSIS](../linux/sql-server-linux-migrate-ssis.md).

## Set language mode to SQL in VS Code

To enable `mssql` commands and T-SQL IntelliSense, set the language mode to **SQL** in Visual Studio Code.

1. Open Visual Studio Code and then open a new window. 

2. Click **Plain Text** in the lower right-hand corner of the status bar.
 
3. In the **Select language mode** drop-down menu that opens, select or enter **SQL**, and then press **ENTER** to set the language mode to SQL. 

## Supported authentication method

Refer to [authentication methods for deployment](ssis-quickstart-deploy-ssms.md#authentication-methods-for-deployment).

## Connect to the SSIS Catalog database

Use Visual Studio Code to establish a connection to the SSIS Catalog.

1. In VS Code, press **CTRL+SHIFT+P** (or **F1**) to open the Command Palette.

2. Type **sqlcon** and press **ENTER**.

3. Press **ENTER** to select **Create Connection Profile**. This step creates a connection profile for your SQL Server instance.

4. Follow the prompts to specify the connection properties for the new connection profile. After specifying each value, press **ENTER** to continue. 

   | Setting       | Suggested value | More info |
   | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | 
   | **Server name** | The fully qualified server name |  |
   | **Database name** | **SSISDB** | The name of the database to which to connect. |
   | **Authentication** | SQL Login | |
   | **User name** | The server admin account | This account is the account that you specified when you created the server. |
   | **Password (SQL Login)** | The password for your server admin account | This password is the password that you specified when you created the server. |
   | **Save Password?** | Yes or No | If you do not want to enter the password each time, select Yes. |
   | **Enter a name for this profile** | A profile name, such as **mySSISServer** | A saved profile name speeds your connection on subsequent logins. | 

5. Press the **ESC** key to close the info message that informs you that the profile is created and connected.

6. Verify your connection in the status bar.

## Run the T-SQL code
Run the following Transact-SQL code to deploy an SSIS project.

1. In the **Editor** window, enter the following query in the empty query window.

2. Update the parameter values in the `catalog.deploy_project` stored procedure for your system.

3. Press **CTRL+SHIFT+E** to run the code and deploy the project.

```sql
DECLARE @ProjectBinary AS varbinary(max)
DECLARE @operation_id AS bigint
SET @ProjectBinary = (SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK '<project_file_path>.ispac', SINGLE_BLOB) AS BinaryData)

EXEC catalog.deploy_project @folder_name = '<target_folder>',
    @project_name = '<project_name',
    @Project_Stream = @ProjectBinary,
    @operation_id = @operation_id out
```
