# Lesson 3-1 - Copying the Deployment Bundle

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


In this task, you will copy the deployment bundle to the destination computer.  
  
The easiest way to copy the deployment bundle to the destination computer is to first create a public share on the destination computer, map a drive to the public share, and then copy the deployment bundle to the share. If you do not know how to create and configure public folders or map drives, see the Windows documentation.  
  
### To copy the deployment bundle  
  
1.  Locate the deployment bundle on your computer.  
  
    If you used the default location, the deployment bundle is the Bin\Deployment folder within the Deployment Tutorial folder.  
  
2.  Right-click the Deployment folder and click **Copy**.  
  
3.  Locate the public share to which you want to copy the folder on the target computer and click **Paste**.
