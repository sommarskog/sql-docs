  Use the **Package Properties** dialog box to view properties for packages that are stored on the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] server.  
  
 For more information, see [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Server](../integration-services-ssis-packages.md).

##  <a name="open_dialog"></a> Open the Package Properties dialog box  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] server.  
  
     You're connecting to the instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] that hosts the SSISDB database.  
  
2.  In Object Explorer, expand the tree to display the **Integration Services Catalogs** node.

 **Entry Point**  
 The value of **True** indicates that the package is started directly. The value of **False** indicates that the package is started by another package using the Execute Package task. The default value is **True**.  
  
 You set this property in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] for both the parent package and the child packages by right-clicking the package in Solution Explorer and then clicking **Entry-point Package**.
