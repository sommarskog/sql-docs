# Azure Storage connection manager

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]

The Azure Storage connection manager enables a SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) package to connect to an Azure Storage account. The connection manager is a component of the [SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Feature Pack for Azure](../../integration-services/azure-feature-pack-for-integration-services-ssis.md). 
  
In the **Add SSIS Connection Manager** dialog box, select **AzureStorage** > **Add**.  
  
The following properties are available.

- **Service:** Specifies the storage service to connect to.
- **Account name:** Specifies the storage account name.
- **Authentication:** Specifies the authentication method to use. AccessKey, ServicePrincipal, and SharedAccessSignature authentication are supported.
    - **AccessKey:** For this authentication method, specify the **Account key**.
    - **ServicePrincipal:** For this authentication method, specify the **Application ID**, **Application key**, and **Tenant ID** of the service principal.
      For **Test Connection** to work, the service principal should be assigned at least the **Storage Blob Data Reader** role to the storage account.
      For more information, see [Grant access to Azure blob and queue data with RBAC in the Azure portal](/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal#assign-rbac-roles-using-the-azure-portal).
    - **SharedAccessSignature:** For this authentication method, specify at least the **Token** of the shared access signature.
      To test connection, specify additionally the resource scope to test against. It may be **Service**, **Container**, or **Blob**.
      For **Container** and **Blob**, specify container name and blob path, respectively.
      For more information, see [Azure Storage shared access signature overview](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview).
- **Environment:** Specifies the cloud environment hosting the storage account.

## Managed identities for Azure resources authentication
When running SSIS packages on [Azure-SSIS integration runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory (ADF)](/azure/data-factory/concepts-integration-runtime#azure-ssis-integration-runtime), you can use Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication with [the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your ADF](/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-blob-storage#managed-identity) to access Azure Storage. Your Azure-SSIS IR can access and copy data from or to your storage account by using this managed identity.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use user-assigned managed identity, SSIS integration runtime Azure Active Directory authentication needs to be enabled with the same user-assigned managed identity. For more information, see [Enable Azure Active Directory authentication for Azure-SSIS integration runtime](/azure/data-factory/enable-aad-authentication-azure-ssis-ir).

Refer to the [Authenticate access to Azure Storage using AAD](/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad) article for Azure Storage authentication in general. To use AAD authentication with the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your ADF to access Azure Storage, follow these steps:
 
1. [Find the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your ADF from Azure portal](/azure/data-factory/data-factory-service-identity). Go to your data factory's **Properties**. Copy the **Managed Identity Application ID** (not the **Managed Identity Object ID**).

1. Grant the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your ADF the required permissions to access Azure Storage. For more details about roles, see the [Manage access rights to Azure Storage data with RBAC](/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal) article.

   - **As source**, in Access control (IAM), grant at least the **Storage Blob Data Reader** role.
   - **As destination**, in Access control (IAM), grant at least the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role.

Finally, you can configure AAD authentication with the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your ADF on the Azure Storage connection manager. Here are the options to do this:

- **Configure at design time.** In SSIS Designer, double-click on your Azure Storage connection manager to open the **Azure Storage Connection Manager Editor**. Select the **Use managed identity to authenticate on Azure** option.

  > [!NOTE]
  >  Currently, this option doesn't take effect (indicating that AAD authentication with the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your ADF doesn't work) when you run your package in SSIS Designer or on SQL Server.

- **Configure at run time.** When you run your package via [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../ssis-quickstart-run-ssms.md) or [Execute SSIS Package activity in ADF pipeline](/azure/data-factory/how-to-invoke-ssis-package-ssis-activity), find the Azure Storage connection manager and update its property `ConnectUsingManagedIdentity` to `True`.

  > [!NOTE]
  > On Azure-SSIS IR, all other authentication methods (for example, integrated security and password) preconfigured on your Azure Storage connection manager are overridden when using AAD authentication with the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your ADF.

To configure AAD authentication with the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your ADF on your existing packages, the preferred way is to rebuild your SSIS project with the [latest SSIS Designer](../../ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md) at least once. Redeploy your SSIS project to run on Azure-SSIS IR, so that the new connection manager property `ConnectUsingManagedIdentity` is automatically added to all Azure Storage connection managers in your project. The alternative way is to directly use property overrides with the property path *\Package.Connections[{the name of your connection manager}].Properties[ConnectUsingManagedIdentity]* assigned to `True` at run time.

## Secure network traffic to your storage account
ADF is now a [trusted Microsoft service](/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#trusted-microsoft-services) to Azure Storage. When you use AAD authentication with the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your ADF, it's possible to 
secure your storage account by [limiting access to selected networks](/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#change-the-default-network-access-rule) while still allowing your ADF to access it. Please refer to the [Managing exceptions](/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#managing-exceptions) article for instructions.
