# Azure Subscription Connection Manager

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  The **Azure Subscription connection manager** enables an SSIS package to connect to an Azure subscription by using the values you specify for the properties: Azure Subscription ID and Management Certificate.  
  
 The **Azure Subscription connection manager** is a component of the [SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Feature Pack for Azure](../../integration-services/azure-feature-pack-for-integration-services-ssis.md).
  
1.  In the **Add SSIS Connection Manager** dialog box shown above, you select **Azure Subscription**, and click **Add**.  You should see the following **Azure Subscription Connection Manager Editor** dialog box.

2.  Enter your Azure subscription ID, which uniquely identifies an Azure subscription, for the **Azure subscription ID**.  The value can be found on the [Azure Management Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com) under **Settings** page:

3.  Choose **Management certificate store location** and **Management certificate store name** from the drop-down lists.  
  
4.  Enter **Management certificate thumbprint** or click the **Browse...** to choose a certificate from the selected store. The certificate must be uploaded as a management certificate for the subscription. To do so, click **Upload** on the following page of the Azure Portal (see this [MSDN post](/previous-versions/azure/gg551722(v=azure.100)) for more detail).

5.  Click **Test Connection** to test the connection.  
  
6.  Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
