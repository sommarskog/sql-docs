# Analysis Services Connection Manager

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  An [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] connection manager enables a package to connect to a server that runs an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database or to an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project that provides access to cube and dimension data. You can only connect to an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project while developing packages in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. At run time, packages connect to the server and the database to which you deployed the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project.  
  
 Both tasks, such as the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] Execute DDL task and the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] Processing task, and destinations, such as the Data Mining Model Training destination, use an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] connection manager.  
  
 For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] databases, see [Multidimensional Model Databases &#40;SSAS&#41;](/analysis-services/multidimensional-models/multidimensional-model-databases-ssas).  
  
## Configuration of the Analysis Services Connection Manager  
 When you add an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] connection manager to a package, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] creates a connection manager that is resolved as an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] connection at run time, sets the connection manager properties, and adds the connection manager to the **Connections** collection on the package. The **ConnectionManagerType** property of the connection manager is set to **MSOLAP100**.  
  
 You can configure the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] connection manager in the following ways:  
  
-   Provide a connection string configured to meet the requirements of the Microsoft OLE Provider for Analysis Services provider.  
  
-   Specify the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project to connect to.  
  
-   If you are connecting to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], specify the authentication mode.  

> [!NOTE]    
>  If you use SSIS in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and want to connect to Azure Analysis Services (AAS) instance, you can not use an account with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled, but must use an account that does not require any interactivity/MFA or a service principal instead. To use the latter, see [here](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-service-principal) to create one and assign the server administrator role to it, then select **Use a specific user name and password** to log on to the server in your connection manager, and finally enter `User name: app:YourApplicationID` and `Password: YourAuthorizationKey`.
  
-   Indicate whether the connection that is created from the connection manager is retained at run time.  
  
 You can set properties through [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer or programmatically.  
  
 For more information about the properties that you can set in [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer, click one of the following topic:
