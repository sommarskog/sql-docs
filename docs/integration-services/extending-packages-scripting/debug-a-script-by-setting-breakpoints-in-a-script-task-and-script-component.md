# Debug a Script by Setting Breakpoints in a Script Task and Script Component

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  This procedure describes how to set breakpoints in the scripts that are used in the Script task and Script component.  
  
 After you set breakpoints in the script, the **Set Breakpoints - \<object name>** dialog box lists the breakpoints, along with the built-in breakpoints.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Under certain circumstances, breakpoints in the Script task and Script component are ignored. For more information, see the **Debugging the Script Task** section in [Coding and Debugging the Script Task](../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting/task/coding-and-debugging-the-script-task.md) and the **Debugging the Script Component** section in [Coding and Debugging the Script Component](../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting/data-flow-script-component/coding-and-debugging-the-script-component.md).  
  
### To set a breakpoint in script  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  Double-click the package that contains the script in which you want to set breakpoints.  
  
3.  To open the Script task, click the **Control Flow** tab, and then double-click the Script task.  
  
4.  To open the Script component, click the **Data Flow** tab, and then double-click the Script component.  
  
5.  Click **Script** and then click **Edit Script**.  
  
6.  In [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Tools for Applications (VSTA), locate the line of script on which you want to set a breakpoint, right-click that line, point to **Breakpoint**, and then click **Insert Breakpoint**.  
  
     The breakpoint icon appears on the line of code.  
  
7.  On the **File** menu, click **Exit**.  
  
8.  Click **OK**.  
  
9. To save the package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.
