# Developing Specific Types of Data Flow Components

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  This section covers the specifics of developing source components, transformation components with synchronous outputs, transformation components with asynchronous outputs, and destination components.  
  
 For information about component development in general, see [Developing a Custom Data Flow Component](../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/data-flow/developing-a-custom-data-flow-component.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Developing a Custom Source Component](../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects-data-flow-types/developing-a-custom-source-component.md)  
 Contains information on developing a component that accesses data from an external data source and supplies it to downstream components in the data flow.  
  
 [Developing a Custom Transformation Component with Synchronous Outputs](../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects-data-flow-types/developing-a-custom-transformation-component-with-synchronous-outputs.md)  
 Contains information on developing a transformation component whose outputs are synchronous to its inputs. These components do not add data to the data flow, but process data as it passes through.  
  
 [Developing a Custom Transformation Component with Asynchronous Outputs](../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects-data-flow-types/developing-a-custom-transformation-component-with-asynchronous-outputs.md)  
 Contains information on developing a transformation component whose outputs are not synchronous to its inputs. These components receive data from upstream components, but also add data to the dataflow.  
  
 [Developing a Custom Destination Component](../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects-data-flow-types/developing-a-custom-destination-component.md)  
 Contains information on developing a component that receives rows from upstream components in the data flow and writes them to an external data source.  
  
## Reference  
 <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline>  
 Contains the classes and interfaces used to create custom data flow components.  
  
 <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.Wrapper>  
 Contains the unmanaged classes and interfaces of the data flow task. The developer uses these, and the managed <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline> namespace, when building a data flow programmatically or creating custom data flow components.
