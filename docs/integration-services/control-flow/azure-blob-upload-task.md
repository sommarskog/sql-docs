# Azure Blob Upload Task

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


The **Azure Blob Upload Task** enables an SSIS package to upload files to Azure Blob Storage.
    
To add an **Azure Blob Upload Task**, drag-drop it to the SSIS Designer, and double-click or right-click and click **Edit** to see the following **Azure Blob Upload Task Editor** dialog box.  
  
 The **Azure Blob Upload Task** is a component of the [SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Feature Pack for Azure](../../integration-services/azure-feature-pack-for-integration-services-ssis.md).
  
 The following table provides descriptions for the fields in this dialog box.  

|**Field**|**Description**|  
|---|---|  
|AzureStorageConnection|Specify an existing Azure Storage Connection Manager or create a new one that refers to an Azure Storage Account, which points to where the blob files are hosted.|  
|BlobContainer|Specifies the name of the blob container that contains the uploaded files as blobs.|  
|BlobDirectory|Specifies the blob directory where the uploaded file is stored as a block blob. The blob directory is a virtual hierarchical structure. If the blob already exists, it is replaced.|  
|LocalDirectory|Specify the local directory that contains the files to be uploaded.|  
|SearchRecursively|Specify whether to search recursively within sub-directories.|  
|FileName|Specifies a name filter to select files with the specified name pattern. For example, `MySheet*.xls\*` includes files such as `MySheet001.xls` and `MySheetABC.xlsx`.|  
|TimeRangeFrom/TimeRangeTo|Specifies a time range filter. Files modified after **TimeRangeFrom** and before **TimeRangeTo** are included.|
