# SQL Server Integration Services

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]

SQL Server [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] is a platform for building enterprise-level data integration and data transformations solutions. Use [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] to solve complex business problems by copying or downloading files, loading data warehouses, cleansing and mining data, and managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] objects and data.

## Capabilities

[!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] can [extract and transform data](./data-flow/data-flow.md) from a wide variety of sources such as XML data files, flat files, and relational data sources, and then load the data into one or more destinations.

[!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] includes:

- A rich set of built-in [tasks](./control-flow/integration-services-tasks.md) and [transformations](./data-flow/transformations/integration-services-transformations.md).
- [Graphical tools](ssis-designer.md) for building packages.
- An SSIS [Catalog database](./catalog/ssis-catalog.md) to store, run, and manage packages.

You can use the graphical [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] tools to create solutions without writing a single line of code. You can also program the extensive [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] object model to create packages programmatically and code custom tasks and other package objects.

## Get started

You can start by installing SQL Server Integration Services, which is part of SQL Server setup. 

For installation instructions and guidance, see [Install Integration Services](install-windows/install-integration-services.md).
