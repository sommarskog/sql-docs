# Teradata destination

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]

The Teradata destination bulk loads data into Teradata Database.

The destination uses the Teradata connection manager to connect to a data source. For more information, see [Teradata connection manager](teradata-connection-manager.md).

## Load options

Teradata destination supports two data load modes:

- **TPT Stream**: This mode uses the TPT API Stream operator (Teradata TPump protocol).

- **TPT Load** (fast bulk-load): This mode uses the TPT API Load operator (Teradata FastLoad protocol) for fast bulk loading.

Fast load mode has below restrictions:

- The limit of sessions for Teradata database is determined by whichever below factor is encountered first:
    - Session limits set using the SESSIONS command
    - The Teradata Database limit of one session per AMP
    - The platform limit on maximum number of sessions per application: Defined by MaxSess variable in the communications processor (COP) Interface software file, CLISPB.DAT. You can use the TDP SET MAXSESSIONS command to specify a platform limit. The default limit is equal to the server MAXSESS.

- Join indexes are not supported.
- Foreign key references in target tables are not supported.
- Target tables defined with a secondary index are not supported.

For more information on the Teradata fast load restrictions, see Teradata's fast load reference.

You can set the mode in the [Teradata Destination Editor (Connection Manager Page)](#teradata-destination-editor-connection-manager-page).

## Error handling

Errors returned during the load process are written to temporary error tables that are locked during loading process.
**Maximum number of errors (MaxErrors)** property in Advanced Editor sets the maximum number of errors that can be written to these tables.

If the Maximum number of errors is greater than zero, error tables with unique names are generated, and informational message is printed to package log. The errors can be retrieved by standard SSIS component error output.

The temporary tables are dropped once the loading process is completed. If the temporal tables cannot be read by Teradata destination, they are not dropped unless **Always drop error table** property is checked.  If the loading process is stopped before completion, you need to manually drop these tables if needed. These tables are located in the same database with the destination table.

When the **Maximum number of errors** is reached, the target table state depends on the mode being used.

- In fast load mode, the target table is not usable. To execute again, you must truncate or drop and recreate the target table. Rollback is not supported.
- In TPT Steam operator mode, Teradata destination executes via buffered row mechanism. If job fails, all the changes that were completed (buffers were sent) at the time of failure are permanent in target table(s). There is no rollback concept. Error tables will be dropped.

The Teradata destination has an error output. For more information, see [Teradata Destination Editor (Error Output Page)](#teradata-destination-editor-error-output-page).

## Parallelism

Parallelism is restricted in fast load mode, multiple independent fast load jobs cannot access the same table at the same time. Also the number of concurrent fast load jobs is limited by database variable **MaxLoadTasks**.

There is no restriction of parallelism in TPT Stream mode. It is possible to run multiple Teradata destinations concurrently against the same table, while this may reduce the performance per Teradata. See Teradata documentation for more information.

## Troubleshooting the Teradata destination

You can log the calls that the Teradata source makes to the Teradata Parallel Transporter API (TPT API). You can enable package logging and select the **Diagnostic** event at the package level to log the calls.

You can log the ODBC calls that the Teradada source makes to the Teradata ODBC driver by enabling the ODBC driver manager trace. For more information, see the Microsoft documentation on *How To Generate an ODBC Trace with ODBC the Data Source Administrator*.
