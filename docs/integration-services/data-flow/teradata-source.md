# Connect to the Teradata source

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]

The Teradata source extracts data from Teradata databases by using:
- A table or a view.
- The results of an SQL statement.

The source uses the Teradata connection manager to connect to the Teradata source. For more information, see [Use the Teradata connection manager](teradata-connection-manager.md).

## Troubleshoot the Teradata source

You can log the calls that the Teradata source makes to the Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT) API. To do so, enable package logging and then select the **Diagnostic** event at the package level.

You can log the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) calls that the Teradata source makes to the Teradata ODBC driver by enabling the ODBC driver manager trace. For more information, see [How to generate an ODBC trace with the ODBC Data Source Administrator](../../odbc/admin/setting-tracing-options.md).

## Parallelism

The Teradata source supports parallelism, wherein export jobs can access the same table or different tables at same time. A database variable called `MaxLoadTasks` sets the limit of the number of export jobs that can run at the same time. You can define this maximum number by using the `MaxLoadTasks` variable.

## Teradata source custom properties

The custom properties of the Teradata source are listed in the following table. All properties are read/write.

|Property name|Data type|Description|

|MaxSessions|Integer|The maximum number of sessions that are logged in. This value must be greater than one. The default value is one session for each available Access Module Processor (AMP).|

The job will be terminated with an error if the DBS does not support *NoSpool*.|
|SqlCommand|String|The SQL command to be executed when `AccessMode` is set to *SQL Command*.|
|TableName|String|The name of the table containing the data to be used when `AccessMode` is set to *Table Name*.|
|TenacityHours|Integer|The number of hours the TPT driver attempts to log in when the maximum number of load/export operations are already running. The default value is *4 hours*. This property is in the **Advanced Editor** pane.|
|TenacitySleep|Integer|The number of minutes the TPT driver pauses before attempting to log in when the limit is reached. The limit is defined by the `MaxSessions` and `TenacityHours` properties. Default value is 6 minutes. This property is in the **Advanced Editor** pane.|
|UnicodePassThrough|Boolean|*Off* (default value): Disable Unicode pass-through. <br>*On*: Enable Unicode pass-through.|

## Configure the Teradata source

You can configure the Teradata source programmatically or by using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Designer.

The **Teradata Source Editor** pane is shown in the following image. For more information, go to each of the following Teradata Source Editor sections:

- [The Connection Manager pane](#the-connection-manager-pane)
- [The Columns pane](#the-columns-pane)
- [The Error Output pane](#the-error-output-pane)

![Teradata Source Editor](media/teradata-source.png)

The **Advanced Editor** pane contains properties that can be set programmatically. To open the pane:
- On the **Data Flow** page of your Integration Services project, right-click the Oracle source, and then select **Show Advanced Editor**.

For more information about the properties that you can set in the **Advanced Editor** pane, see [Teradata source custom properties](#teradata-source-custom-properties).

## The Connection Manager pane

Use the **Connection Manager** pane to select the Teradata connection manager instance for the source. In this pane, you can also select a table or a view from the database. To open the pane:

1. In SQL Server Data Tools, open the SSIS package that contains the Teradata source.

1. On the **Data Flow** tab, double-click the Teradata source.

1. In Teradata Source Editor, select the **Connection Manager** tab.

### Options

**Connection manager**

* Select an existing connection manager from the list, or select **New** to create a new Teradata connection manager instance.

**New**

* Select **New**. The **Teradata Connection Manager Editor** pane opens. From this pane, you can create a new connection manager.

**Data Access Mode**

* Choose a method for selecting data from the source. The options are shown in the following table:

    |Option|Description|
    |:-|:-|
    |Table name - TPT Export|Retrieve data from a table or a view in the Teradata data source. When this option is selected, select an available table or view from the list for **Name of the table or the view**.|
    |SQL command - TPT Export|Retrieve data from the Teradata data source by using an SQL query. When this option is selected, enter a query in one of the following ways: <ul><li>Enter the text of the SQL query in the **SQL command text** field.</li><li>Select **Browse** to load the SQL query from a text file.</li><li>Select **Parse query** to verify the syntax of the query text.</li></ul>|

**Preview**

* Select **Preview** to view up to the first 200 rows of the data that's extracted from the table or view you selected.

## The Columns pane

Use the **Columns** pane to map an output column to each external (source) column. To open the pane:

1. In SQL Server Data Tools, open the SSIS package that contains the Teradata source.

1. On the **Data Flow** tab, double-click the Teradata source.

1. In Teradata Source Editor, select the **Columns** tab.

### Options

**Available External Columns**

This table lists the available external columns that you can select to add to the **External Column** list. You can list the columns in the order you choose. You can't use this table to add or delete columns.

* To choose all columns, select the **Select All** check box.

**External Columns**

The external (source) columns that you selected are listed in order. To change the order, first clear the **Available External Column** list, and then select the columns in a different order.

**Output Column**

Although the name of the selected external (source) column is the default output name, you can enter any unique name.

>[!NOTE]
>>If there are columns that contain unsupported data types, you'll receive a warning that displays those unsupported data types, and the relevant columns will be removed from the mapping columns.

## The Error Output pane

Use the **Error Output** pane to select error-handling options. To open the pane:

1. In SQL Server Data Tools, open the SSIS package that contains the Teradata source.

1. On the **Data Flow** tab, double-click the Teradata source.

1. In Teradata Source Editor, select the **Error Output** tab.

### Options

**Error behavior**

* Select how the Teradata source should handle errors in a flow: 
  * Ignore the failure
  * Redirect the row
  * Fail the component

**Related topics**: See [Error handling in data](error-handling-in-data.md).

**Truncation**

* Select how the Teradata source should handle truncation in a flow:
