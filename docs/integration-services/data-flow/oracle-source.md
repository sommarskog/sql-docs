# Oracle source

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]

The Oracle source extracts data from Oracle Database with below modes:

- A table or view.

- The results of an SQL statement.

The source uses an Oracle Connection Manager to connect to Oracle source. For more information, see [Oracle Connection Manager](oracle-connection-manager.md).

## Error output

Error output includes the following columns:  

- **Error Code**: A number that represents error type of the current error. The error code could be from:
    - Oracle server. See detail error description in Oracle database documentation.
    - SSIS runtime. For a list of SSIS error codes, see the SSIS Error Code and Message Reference.
- **Error Column**: The source column number that causes the conversion errors.

- **Error Data Columns**: The data which causes the error.

The Oracle source returns errors occurred during loading and extraction process in the error output. For more information, see [Oracle Source Editor (Error Output Page)](#oracle-source-editor-error-output-page).

## Troubleshooting the Oracle source

You can log the ODBC calls that the Oracle source makes to Oracle data sources to troubleshoot the data exporting. To log the ODBC calls that the Oracle source makes to Oracle data sources, enable the ODBC driver manager trace. For more information, see the Microsoft documentation on *How To Generate an ODBC Trace with ODBC the Data Source Administrator.*

## Oracle source custom properties

The custom properties of the Oracle source are as below. All properties are read/write.

|Property Name|Data Type|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|AccessMode|Integer (enumeration)|The mode used to access the database. The possible values are **Table Name** and **SQL Command**. The default is **Table Name**.|
|BatchSize|Integer|The size of the batch for bulk loading. This is the number of records extracted as an array. <br>This property is set by **Advanced Editor** only|
|DefaultCodePage|Integer|The code page to use when data source does not have code page information. <br>This property is set by **Advanced Editor** only.|
|PreFetchCount|Integer|The number of pre-fetched rows. <br>This property is set by **Advanced Editor** only.|
|SqlCommand|String|The SQL command to be executed when AccessMode is set to SQL Command.|
|TableName|String|The name of the table with the data to be used when AccessMode is set to Table Name.|

## Configuring the Oracle source

You can configure the Oracle Source programmatically or through the SSIS Designer.

The Oracle Source Editor is shown in below picture. It contains Connection Manager Page, Columns Page, and Error Output Page.

For more information, see one of the following sections:

- [Oracle Source Editor (Connection Manager Page)](#oracle-source-editor-connection-manager-page)
- [Oracle Source Editor (Columns Page)](#oracle-source-editor-columns-page)
- [Oracle Source Editor (Error Output Page)](#oracle-source-editor-error-output-page)

On **Columns** page, **Oracle Source Editor** dialog box is used to map an output column to each external (source) column.

**To open the Oracle Source Editor Columns Page**

- In SQL Server Data Tools, open the SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) package that has the Oracle source.

- On the Data Flow tab, double-click the Oracle source.

- In the Oracle Source Editor, click Columns.

### Options

**Available External Columns**
