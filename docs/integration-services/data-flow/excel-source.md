# Excel Source

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  The Excel source extracts data from worksheets or ranges in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Excel workbooks.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For detailed info about connecting to Excel files, and about limitations and known issues for loading data from or to Excel files, see [Load data from or to Excel with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)](../load-data-to-from-excel-with-ssis.md).

## Access Modes
 The Excel source provides four different data access modes for extracting data:  
  
-   A table or view.  
  
-   A table or view specified in a variable.  
  
-   The results of an SQL statement. The query can be a parameterized query.  
  
-   The results of an SQL statement stored in a variable.  
  
 The Excel source uses an Excel connection manager to connect to a data source, and the connection manager specifies the workbook file to use. For more information, see [Excel Connection Manager](../../integration-services/connection-manager/excel-connection-manager.md).  
  
 The Excel source has one regular output and one error output.  
  
## Excel Source Configuration  
 You can set properties through [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer or programmatically.  
  
 The **Advanced Editor** dialog box reflects all the properties that can be set programmatically. For more information about the properties that you can set in the **Advanced Editor** dialog box or programmatically, click one of the following topics:  
  
-   [Common Properties](./set-the-properties-of-a-data-flow-component.md)  
  
-   [Excel Custom Properties](../../integration-services/data-flow/excel-custom-properties.md)  
  
 For information about looping through a group of Excel files, see [Loop through Excel Files and Tables by Using a Foreach Loop Container](../../integration-services/control-flow/loop-through-excel-files-and-tables-by-using-a-foreach-loop-container.md).  
  
## Excel Source Editor (Connection Manager Page)
  Use the **Connection Manager** node of the **Excel Source Editor** dialog box to select the [!INCLUDE[ofprexcel](../../includes/ofprexcel-md.md)] workbook for the source to use. The Excel source reads data from a worksheet or named range in an existing workbook.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The **CommandTimeout** property of the Excel source is not available in the **Excel Source Editor**, but can be set by using the **Advanced Editor**. For more information on this property, see the Excel Source section of [Excel Custom Properties](../../integration-services/data-flow/excel-custom-properties.md).
