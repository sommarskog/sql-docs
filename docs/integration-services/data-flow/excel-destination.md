# Excel Destination

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  The Excel destination loads data into worksheets or ranges in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Excel workbooks.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For detailed info about connecting to Excel files, and about limitations and known issues for loading data from or to Excel files, see [Load data from or to Excel with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)](../load-data-to-from-excel-with-ssis.md).
  
## Access Modes  
 The Excel destination provides three different data access modes for loading data:  
  
-   A table or view.  
  
-   A table or view specified in a variable.  
  
-   The results of an SQL statement. The query can be a parameterized query.  
  
## Configure the Excel Destination  
 The Excel destination uses an Excel connection manager to connect to a data source, and the connection manager specifies the workbook file to use. For more information, see [Excel Connection Manager](../../integration-services/connection-manager/excel-connection-manager.md).  
  
 The Excel destination has one regular input and one error output.  
  
 You can set properties through [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer or programmatically.  
  
 The **Advanced Editor** dialog box reflects all the properties that can be set programmatically. For more information about the properties that you can set in the **Advanced Editor** dialog box or programmatically, click one of the following topics:  
  
-   [Common Properties](./set-the-properties-of-a-data-flow-component.md)  
  
-   [Excel Custom Properties](../../integration-services/data-flow/excel-custom-properties.md)  
  
 For more information about how to set properties, see [Set the Properties of a Data Flow Component](../../integration-services/data-flow/set-the-properties-of-a-data-flow-component.md).  
  
## Excel Destination Editor (Connection Manager Page)
  Use the **Connection Manager** page of the **Excel Destination Editor** dialog box to specify data source information, and to preview the results. The Excel destination loads data into a worksheet or a named range in a [!INCLUDE[ofprexcel](../../includes/ofprexcel-md.md)] workbook.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The **CommandTimeout** property of the Excel destination is not available in the **Excel Destination Editor**, but can be set by using the **Advanced Editor**. In addition, certain Fast Load options are available only in the **Advanced Editor**. For more information on these properties, see the Excel Destination section of [Excel Custom Properties](../../integration-services/data-flow/excel-custom-properties.md).
