# Add or Delete a Component in a Data Flow

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  Data flow components are sources, destinations, and transformations in a data flow. Before you can add components to a data flow, the control flow in the package must include a Data Flow task.  
  
 The following procedures describe how to add or delete a component in the data flow of a package.  
  
### To add a component to a data flow  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  Click the **Control Flow** tab, and then double-click the Data Flow task that contains the data flow to which you want to add a component.  
  
4.  In the Toolbox, expand **Data Flow Sources**, **Data Flow Transformations**, or **Data Flow Destinations**, and then drag a data flow item to the design surface of the **Data Flow** tab.  
  
5.  To save the updated package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.  
  
### To delete a component from a data flow  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  Click the **Control Flow** tab, and then double-click the Data Flow task that contains the data flow from which you want to delete a component.  
  
4.  Right-click the data flow component, and then click **Delete**.  
  
5.  Confirm the delete operation.  
  
6.  To save the updated package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.
