# Advanced Connection Properties

  Use the **Advanced Connection Properties** dialog box to add more connection parameters to the connection string.  
  
 The additional connection parameters can be any ODBC connection parameter that is supported by the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database instance you are using.  
  
 The parameters added using the **Advanced Connection Properties** dialog box are added to the parameters selected in the **Connect to SQL Server** dialog box.  
  
 The last instance of each parameter provided overrides any previous instances of the parameter. Parameters added using the **Advanced Connection Parameters** dialog box follow and replace the parameters provided in the **SQL Server Connection** dialog box. For example, if the **SQL Server Connection** dialog box specifies SERVER1 as the Server name, and the **Additional Connection Parameters** page contains ;SERVER=SERVER2, the connection will be made to SERVER2.  
  
 Parameters added using the **Advanced Connection Properties** dialog box are passed as plain text.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Do not include login credentials in the **Advanced Connection Properties** dialog box. They will not be encrypted when they are passed across the network.
