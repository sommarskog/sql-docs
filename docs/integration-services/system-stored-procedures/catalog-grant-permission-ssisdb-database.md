  Grants a permission on a securable object in the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] catalog.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```sql
catalog.grant_permission [ @object_type = ] object_type  
    , [ @object_id = ] object_id  
    , [ @principal_id = ] principal_id  
    , [ @permission_type = ] permission_type  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ @object_type = ] *object_type*  
 The type of securable object. Securable objects types include folder (`1`), project (`2`), environment (`3`), and operation (`4`).The *object_type* is **smallint**_._  
  
 [ @object_id = ] *object_id*  
 The unique identifier (ID) of the securable object. The *object_id* is **bigint**.  
  
 [ @principal_id = ] *principal_id*  
 The ID of the principal to be granted permission. The *principal_id* is **int**.  
  
 [ @permission_type = ] *permission_type*  
 The type of permission to be granted. The *permission_type* is **smallint**.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 0 (success)  
  
 1 (object_class is invalid)  
  
 2 (object_id does not exist)  
  
 3 (principal does not exist)  
  
 4 (permission is invalid)  
  
 5 (other error)  
  
## Result Sets  
 None  
  
## Permissions  
 This stored procedure requires one of the following permissions:

|permission_type Value|Permission Name|Permission Description|Applicable Object Types|  
|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|  
|`1`|READ|Allows the principal to read information that is considered part of the object, such as properties. It does not allow the principal to enumerate or read the contents of other objects contained within the object.|Folder, Project, Environment, Operation|  
|`2`|MODIFY|Allows the principal to modify information that is considered part of the object, such as properties. It does not allow the principal to modify other objects contained within the object.|Folder, Project, Environment, Operation|
