# Lesson 5: Add SSIS package configurations for the Package Deployment Model

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]



Package configurations let you set run-time properties and variables from outside the development environment. Configurations allow you to develop packages that are flexible and easy to both deploy and distribute. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] offers the following configuration types:  
  
-   XML configuration file  
  
-   Environment variable  
  
-   Registry entry  
  
-   Parent package variable  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table  
  
In this lesson, you modify the example [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] package that you created in [Lesson 4: Add error flow redirection with SSIS](../integration-services/lesson-4-add-error-flow-redirection-with-ssis.md) to use the Package Deployment Model and take advantage of package configurations. You can also copy the completed Lesson 4 package  included with this tutorial. 

Using the Package Configuration Wizard, you create an XML configuration that updates the **Directory** property of the Foreach Loop container. You use a package-level variable mapped to the **Directory** property. After you create the configuration file, you modify the value of the variable from outside the development environment to a new sample data folder path. When you run the package again, the configuration file populates the value of the variable, and the variable in turn updates the **Directory** property. The package then iterates through the files in the new data folder, rather than in the original hard-coded folder.
