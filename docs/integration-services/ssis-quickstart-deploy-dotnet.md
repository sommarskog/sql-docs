# Deploy an SSIS project with C# code in a .NET app

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


This quickstart demonstrates how to write C# code to connect to a database server and deploy an SSIS project.

To create a C# app, you can use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or another tool of your choice.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code installed. Download the free Community edition of Visual Studio, or the free Visual Studio Code, from [Visual Studio Downloads](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

An Azure SQL Database server listens on port 1433. If you're trying to connect to an Azure SQL Database server from within a corporate firewall, this port must be open in the corporate firewall for you to connect successfully.

## Supported platforms

You can use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS project to the following platforms:

-   SQL Server on Windows.

-   Azure SQL Database. For more info about deploying and running packages in Azure, see [Lift and shift SQL Server Integration Services workloads to the cloud](lift-shift/ssis-azure-lift-shift-ssis-packages-overview.md).

You cannot use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS package to SQL Server on Linux. For more info about running packages on Linux, see [Extract, transform, and load data on Linux with SSIS](../linux/sql-server-linux-migrate-ssis.md).

## For Azure SQL Database, get the connection info

To deploy the project to Azure SQL Database, get the connection information you need to connect to the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB). You need the fully qualified server name and login information in the procedures that follow.

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **SQL Databases** from the left-hand menu, and then select the SSISDB database on the **SQL databases** page. 
3. On the **Overview** page for your database, review the fully qualified server name. To see the **Click to copy** option, hover over the server name. 
4. If you forget your Azure SQL Database server login information, navigate to the SQL Database server page to view the server admin name. You can reset the password if necessary.
5. Click **Show database connection strings**.
6. Review the complete **ADO.NET** connection string. Optionally, your code can use a `SqlConnectionStringBuilder` to recreate this connection string with the individual parameter values that you provide.

## Supported authentication method

Refer to [authentication methods for deployment](ssis-quickstart-deploy-ssms.md#authentication-methods-for-deployment).

## Create a new Visual Studio project

1. In Visual Studio, choose **File**, **New**, **Project**. 
2. In the **New Project** dialog, and expand **Visual C#**.
3. Select **Console App** and enter *deploy_ssis_project* for the project name.
4. Click **OK** to create and open the new project in Visual Studio.

## Add references
1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **References** folder and select **Add Reference**. The **Reference Manager** dialog box opens.
2. In the **Reference Manager** dialog box, expand **Assemblies** and select **Extensions**.
3. Select the following two references to add:
    -   Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Sdk.Sfc
    -   Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo
4. Click the **Browse** button to add a reference to **Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.IntegrationServices**. (This assembly is installed only in the global assembly cache (GAC).) The **Select the files to reference** dialog box opens.
5. In the **Select the files to reference** dialog box, navigate to the GAC folder that contains the assembly. Typically this folder is `C:\Windows\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.IntegrationServices\14.0.0.0__89845dcd8080cc91`.
6. Select the assembly (that is, the .dll file) in the folder and click **Add**.
7. Click **OK** to close the **Reference Manager** dialog box and add the three references. To make sure the references are there, check the **References** list in Solution Explorer.

## Add the C# code 
1. Open **Program.cs**.

2. Replace the contents of **Program.cs** with the following code. Add the appropriate values for your server, database, user, and password.

> [!NOTE]
> The following example uses Windows Authentication. To use SQL Server authentication, replace the `Integrated Security=SSPI;` argument with `User ID=<user name>;Password=<password>;`. If you're connecting to an Azure SQL Database server, you can't use Windows authentication.

```csharp
using Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.IntegrationServices;
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.IO;

namespace deploy_ssis_project
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Variables
            string targetServerName = "localhost";
            string targetFolderName = "Project1Folder";
            string projectName = "Integration Services Project1";
            string projectFilePath = @"C:\Projects\Integration Services Project1\Integration Services Project1\bin\Development\Integration Services Project1.ispac";

            // Create a connection to the server
            string sqlConnectionString = "Data Source=" + targetServerName +
                ";Initial Catalog=master;Integrated Security=SSPI;";
            SqlConnection sqlConnection = new SqlConnection(sqlConnectionString);

            // Create the Integration Services object
            IntegrationServices integrationServices = new IntegrationServices(sqlConnection);

            // Get the Integration Services catalog
            Catalog catalog = integrationServices.Catalogs["SSISDB"];

            // Create the target folder
            CatalogFolder folder = new CatalogFolder(catalog,
                targetFolderName, "Folder description");
            folder.Create();

            Console.WriteLine("Deploying " + projectName + " project.");

            byte[] projectFile = File.ReadAllBytes(projectFilePath);
            folder.DeployProject(projectName, projectFile);

            Console.WriteLine("Done.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Run the code

1. To run the application, press **F5**.
2. In SSMS, verify that the project has been deployed.
