# Deploy an SSIS project from SSMS with Transact-SQL

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]



This quickstart demonstrates how to use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to connect to the SSIS Catalog database, and then use Transact-SQL statements to deploy an SSIS project to the SSIS Catalog. 

SQL Server Management Studio is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to SQL Database. For more info about SSMS, see [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the latest version of SQL Server Management Studio. To download SSMS, see [Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).

## Supported platforms

You can use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS project to the following platforms:

-   SQL Server on Windows.

You cannot use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS package to Azure SQL Database. The `catalog.deploy_project` stored procedure expects path to the `.ispac` file in the local (on premises) file system. For more info about deploying and running packages in Azure, see [Lift and shift SQL Server Integration Services workloads to the cloud](lift-shift/ssis-azure-lift-shift-ssis-packages-overview.md).

You cannot use the information in this quickstart to deploy an SSIS package to SQL Server on Linux. For more info about running packages on Linux, see [Extract, transform, and load data on Linux with SSIS](../linux/sql-server-linux-migrate-ssis.md).

## Supported authentication method

Refer to [authentication methods for deployment](ssis-quickstart-deploy-ssms.md#authentication-methods-for-deployment).

## Connect to the SSIS Catalog database

Use SQL Server Management Studio to establish a connection to the SSIS Catalog. 

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio.

2. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, enter the following information:

   | Setting       | Suggested value | More info | 
   | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | 
   | **Server type** | Database engine | This value is required. |
   | **Server name** | The fully qualified server name |  |
   | **Authentication** | SQL Server Authentication | |
   | **Login** | The server admin account | This account is the account that you specified when you created the server. |
   | **Password** | The password for your server admin account | This password is the password that you specified when you created the server. |

3. Click **Connect**. The Object Explorer window opens in SSMS. 

4. In Object Explorer, expand **Integration Services Catalogs** and then expand **SSISDB** to view the objects in the SSIS Catalog database.


## Run the T-SQL code
Run the following Transact-SQL code to deploy an SSIS project.

1.  In SSMS, open a new query window and paste the following code.

2.  Update the parameter values in the `catalog.deploy_project` stored procedure for your system.

3.  Make sure that **SSISDB** is the current database.

4.  Run the script.

5. In Object Explorer, refresh the contents of **SSISDB** if necessary and check for the project that you deployed.

```sql
DECLARE @ProjectBinary AS varbinary(max)
DECLARE @operation_id AS bigint
SET @ProjectBinary =
    (SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK '<project_file_path>.ispac', SINGLE_BLOB) AS BinaryData)

EXEC catalog.deploy_project @folder_name = '<target_folder>',
    @project_name = '<project_name',
    @Project_Stream = @ProjectBinary,
    @operation_id = @operation_id out
```
