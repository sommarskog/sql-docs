# Understanding the Differences between Local and Remote Execution

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  Package developers and administrators should be aware that there are restrictions related to where an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] package runs.  
  
-   **A package runs on the same computer as the program that launches it**. Even when a program loads a package that is stored remotely on another server, the package runs on the local computer.  
  
-   **You can only run a package outside the development environment on a computer that has Integration Services installed**. You cannot run packages outside of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] on a client computer that does not have [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] installed, and the terms of your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] licensing may not permit you to install [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] on additional computers. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] is a server component and is not redistributable to client computers. To run packages from a client computer, you need to launch them in a manner that ensures that the packages run on the server.
