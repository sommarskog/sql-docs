# Running and Managing Packages Programmatically

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  If you need manage and run [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages outside the development environment, you can manipulate packages programmatically. In this approach, you have a range of options:  
  
-   Load and run an existing package without modification.  
  
-   Load an existing package, reconfigure it (for example, for a different data source), and run it.  
  
-   Create a new package, add and configure components object by object and property by property, save it, and run it.  
  
 You can load and run an existing package from a client application by writing only a few lines of code.  
  
 This section describes and demonstrates how to run an existing package programmatically and how to access the output of the data flow from other applications. As an advanced programming option, you can programmatically create an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] package line by line as described in the topic, [Building Packages Programmatically](../../integration-services/building-packages-programmatically/building-packages-programmatically.md).  
  
 This section also discusses other administrative tasks that you can perform programmatically to manage stored packages, running packages, and package roles.  
  
## Running Packages on the Integration Services Server  
 When you deploy packages to the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] server, you can run the packages programmatically by using the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.IntegrationServices> namespace. The Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.IntegrationServices assembly is compiled with .NET Framework 3.5. If you are building a .NET Framework 4.0 application, you might need to add the assembly reference directly to your project file.  
  
 You can also use the namespace to deploy and manage [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] projects on the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] server. For an overview of the namespace and code snippets, see the blog entry, [A Glimpse of the SSIS Catalog Managed Object Model](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-integration-services/a-glimpse-of-the-ssis-catalog-managed-object-model/ba-p/387892), on blogs.msdn.com.
