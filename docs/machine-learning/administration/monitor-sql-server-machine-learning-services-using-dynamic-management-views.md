# Monitor SQL Server Machine Learning Services using dynamic management views (DMVs)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2016 SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-asdbmi.md)]

Use dynamic management views (DMVs) to monitor the execution of external scripts (Python and R), resources used, diagnose problems, and tune performance in SQL Server Machine Learning Services.

In this article, you will find the DMVs that are specific for SQL Server Machine Learning Services. You will also find example queries that show:

+ Settings and configuration options for machine learning
+ Active sessions running external Python or R scripts
+ Execution statistics for the external runtime for Python and R
+ Performance counters for external scripts
+ Memory usage for the OS, SQL Server, and external resource pools
+ Memory configuration for SQL Server and external resource pools
+ Resource Governor resource pools, including external resource pools
+ Installed packages for Python and R

For more general information about DMVs, see [System Dynamic Management Views](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/system-dynamic-management-views.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can also use the custom reports to monitor SQL Server Machine Learning Services. For more information, see [Monitor machine learning using custom reports in Management Studio](monitor-sql-server-machine-learning-services-using-custom-reports-management-studio.md).

## Dynamic management views

The following dynamic management views can be used when monitoring machine learning workloads in SQL Server. To query the DMVs, you need `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission on the instance.

| Dynamic management view | Type | Description |
|-------------------------|------|-------------|
| [sys.dm_external_script_requests](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-external-script-requests.md) | Execution | Returns a row for each active worker account that is running an external script. |
| [sys.dm_external_script_execution_stats](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-external-script-execution-stats.md) | Execution | Returns one row for each type of external script request. |
| [sys.dm_os_performance_counters](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-performance-counters-transact-sql.md) | Execution | Returns a row per performance counter maintained by the server. If you use the search condition `WHERE object_name LIKE '%External Scripts%'`, you can use this information to see how many scripts ran, which scripts were run using which authentication mode, or how many R or Python calls were issued on the instance overall. |
| [sys.dm_resource_governor_external_resource_pools](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-resource-governor-external-resource-pools.md) | Resource Governor | Returns information about the current external resource pool state in Resource Governor, the current configuration of resource pools, and resource pool statistics. |
| [sys.dm_resource_governor_external_resource_pool_affinity](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-resource-governor-external-resource-pool-affinity-transact-sql.md) | Resource Governor | Returns CPU affinity information about the current external resource pool configuration in Resource Governor. Returns one row per scheduler in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] where each scheduler is mapped to an individual processor. Use this view to monitor the condition of a scheduler or to identify runaway tasks. |

For information about monitoring [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instances, see [Catalog Views](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/catalog-views-transact-sql.md) and [Resource Governor Related Dynamic Management Views](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/resource-governor-related-dynamic-management-views-transact-sql.md).

## Settings and configuration

View the Machine Learning Services installation setting and configuration options.

![Output from the settings and configuration query](media/dmv-settings-and-configuration.png "Output from the settings and configuration query")

Run the query below to get this output. For more information on the views and functions used, see [sys.dm_server_registry](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-server-registry-transact-sql.md), [sys.configurations](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-configurations-transact-sql.md), and [SERVERPROPERTY](../../t-sql/functions/serverproperty-transact-sql.md).

```sql
SELECT CAST(SERVERPROPERTY('IsAdvancedAnalyticsInstalled') AS INT) AS IsMLServicesInstalled
    , CAST(value_in_use AS INT) AS ExternalScriptsEnabled
    , COALESCE(SIGN(SUSER_ID(CONCAT (
                    CAST(SERVERPROPERTY('MachineName') AS NVARCHAR(128))
                    , '\SQLRUserGroup'
                    , CAST(serverproperty('InstanceName') AS NVARCHAR(128))
                    ))), 0) AS ImpliedAuthenticationEnabled
    , COALESCE((
            SELECT CAST(r.value_data AS INT)
            FROM sys.dm_server_registry AS r
            WHERE r.registry_key LIKE 'HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\%\SuperSocketNetLib\Tcp'
            AND r.value_name = 'Enabled'
            ), - 1) AS IsTcpEnabled

## Resource pools

In [SQL Server Resource Governor](../../relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor.md), a [resource pool](../../relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor-resource-pool.md) represents a subset of the physical resources of an instance. You can specify limits on the amount of CPU, physical IO, and memory that incoming application requests, including execution of external scripts, can use within the resource pool. View the resource pools used for SQL Server and external scripts.

![Output from the resource pools query](media/dmv-resource-pools.png "Output from the resource pools query")

Run the query below to get this output. For more information on the dynamic management views used, see  [sys.dm_resource_governor_resource_pools](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-resource-governor-resource-pools-transact-sql.md) and [sys.dm_resource_governor_external_resource_pools](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-resource-governor-external-resource-pools.md).
