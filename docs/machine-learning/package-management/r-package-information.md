This article describes how to get information about installed R packages on [Machine Learning Services on SQL Server](../sql-server-machine-learning-services.md) and on [SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters](../../big-data-cluster/machine-learning-services.md). Example R scripts show you how to list package information such as installation path and version.

## Default R library location

When you install machine learning with SQL Server, a single package library is created at the instance level for each language that you install. On Windows, the instance library is a secured folder registered with SQL Server.

All script that runs in-database on SQL Server must load functions from the instance library. SQL Server can't access packages installed to other libraries. This applies to remote clients as well: any R script running in the server compute context can only use packages installed in the instance library.
To protect server assets, the default instance library can be modified only by a computer administrator.

::: moniker range="=sql-server-2016"
The default path of the binaries for R is:

`C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\R_SERVICES\library`

This assumes the default SQL instance, MSSQLSERVER. If SQL Server is installed as a user-defined named instance, the given name is used instead.

::: moniker range="=sql-server-2017"
The default path of the binaries for R is:

`C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL14.MSSQLSERVER\R_SERVICES\library`

This assumes the default SQL instance, MSSQLSERVER. If SQL Server is installed as a user-defined named instance, the given name is used instead.

Run the following statement to verify the default R package library for the current instance:

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script  
  @language = N'R',
  @script = N'OutputDataSet <- data.frame(.libPaths());'
WITH RESULT SETS (([DefaultLibraryName] VARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL));
GO
```

## Default Microsoft R packages

The following Microsoft R packages are installed with SQL Server R Services.

|Packages | Version | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [RevoScaleR](/r-server/r-reference/revoscaler/revoscaler)  | 8.0.3 | Used for remote compute contexts, streaming, parallel execution of rx functions for data import and transformation, modeling, visualization, and analysis. |
| [sqlrutils](../r/ref-r-sqlrutils.md) | 1.0.0 | Used for including R script in stored procedures. |

## Default Microsoft R packages

The following Microsoft R packages are installed with SQL Server Machine Learning Services when you select the R feature during setup.

|Packages | Version | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [RevoScaleR](/r-server/r-reference/revoscaler/revoscaler)  | 9.2 | Used for remote compute contexts, streaming, parallel execution of rx functions for data import and transformation, modeling, visualization, and analysis. |
| [sqlrutils](../r/ref-r-sqlrutils.md) | 1.0.0 | Used for including R script in stored procedures. |
| [MicrosoftML](../r/ref-r-microsoftml.md)| 1.4.0 | Adds machine learning algorithms in R. | 
| [olapR](../r/ref-r-olapr.md) | 1.0.0 | Used for writing MDX statements in R. |

### Component upgrades

By default, R packages are refreshed through service packs and cumulative updates. Additional packages and full version upgrades of core R components are possible only through product upgrades.

::: moniker range="=sql-server-2016"
In addition, you can add MicrosoftML and olapR packages to a SQL Server instance through a component upgrade.

## Default open-source R packages

R support includes open-source R so that you can call base R functions and install additional open-source and third-party packages. R language support includes core functionality such as **base**, **stats**, **utils**, and others. A base installation of R also includes numerous sample datasets and standard R tools such as **RGui** (a lightweight interactive editor) and **RTerm** (an R command prompt).

For information on which version of R is included with each SQL Server version, see [Python and R versions](../sql-server-machine-learning-services.md#versions).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should never manually overwrite the version of R installed by SQL Server Setup with newer versions on the web. Microsoft R packages are based on specific versions of R. Modifying your installation could destabilize it.

## List all installed R packages

The following example uses the R function `installed.packages()` in a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] stored procedure to display a list of R packages that have been installed in the R_SERVICES library for the current SQL instance. This script returns package name and version fields in the DESCRIPTION file.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script
  @language=N'R',
@script = N'str(OutputDataSet);
packagematrix <- installed.packages();
Name <- packagematrix[,1];
Version <- packagematrix[,3];
OutputDataSet <- data.frame(Name, Version);',
@input_data_1 = N'
  '
WITH RESULT SETS ((PackageName nvarchar(250), PackageVersion nvarchar(max) ))
```

For more information about the optional and default fields for the R package DESCRIPTION field, see
[https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file).

## Find a single R package

If you've installed an R package and want to make sure that it's available to a particular SQL Server instance, you can execute a stored procedure to load the package and return messages.

For example, the following statement looks for and loads the [glue](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glue/) package, if available.
If the package cannot be located or loaded, you get an error.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script  
  @language =N'R',
  @script=N'
require("glue")
'
```

To see more information about the package, view the `packageDescription`.
The following statement returns information for the **MicrosoftML** package.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script
  @language = N'R',
  @script = N'
print(packageDescription("MicrosoftML"))
'
```
