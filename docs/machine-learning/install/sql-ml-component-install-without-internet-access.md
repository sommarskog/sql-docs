# Offline install SQL Server Machine Learning Services on Windows computers with no internet access
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2016 and later](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016.md)]

This article describes how to install SQL Server Machine Learning Services on Windows offline on computers with no internet access isolated behind a network firewall.

By default, installers connect to Microsoft download sites to get required and updated components for machine learning on SQL Server. If firewall constraints prevent the installer from reaching these sites, you can use an internet-connected device to download files, transfer files to an offline server, and then run setup.

> [!NOTE]
> Feature capabilities and installation options vary between versions of SQL Server. Use the version selector dropdown to choose the appropriate version of SQL Server.

In-database analytics consist of database engine instance, plus additional components for R and Python integration, depending on the version of SQL Server. 

+ Beginning with [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)], runtimes for R, Python, and Java, are no longer installed with SQL Setup. Instead, install your desired R and/or Python custom runtime(s) and packages. The offline installation process is therefore similar to the online process. For more information, see [Install SQL Server 2022 Machine Learning Services on Windows](sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install-sql-2022.md) or [Install SQL Server 2022 Machine Learning Services on Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup-machine-learning-sql-2022.md).
+ SQL Server 2019 includes R, Python, and Java.
+ SQL Server 2017 includes R and Python.
+ SQL Server 2016 is R-only.

## SQL Server 2022 offline install

Offline installation of [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] is similar to the online installation experience. 

1. Use SQL Setup to install the Machine Learning services feature.
2. Download any desired runtimes and copy them to the offline installation server. Custom runtimes for [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] are customer-installed. CAB files are not used for [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)].
3. Download any desired packages and copy them to the offline installation server. Otherwise, refer to instructions for installation from SQL Setup and installation of any desired custom packages: 

   - [Install SQL Server 2022 Machine Learning Services (Python and R) on Windows](sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install-sql-2022.md)
   - [Install SQL Server Machine Learning Services (Python and R) on Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup-machine-learning-sql-2022.md)

::: moniker range="=sql-server-2016||=sql-server-2017||=sql-server-ver15"

## Transfer files

Copy the SQL Server installation media (.iso or .cab) and in-database analytics CAB files to the target computer. Place the CAB files and installation media file in the same folder on the target machine, such as the setup user's %TEMP% folder.

The %TEMP% folder is required for Python CAB files. For R, you can use %TEMP% or set the `myrcachedirectory` parameter to the CAB path.

## Run Setup

When you run SQL Server Setup on a computer disconnected from the internet, Setup adds an **Offline installation** page to the wizard so that you can specify the location of the CAB files you copied in the previous step.

1. To begin installation, double-click the .iso or .cab file to access the installation media. You should see the **setup.exe** file.

2. Right-click **setup.exe** and run as administrator.

3. When the setup wizard displays the licensing page for open-source R or Python components, click  **Accept**. Acceptance of licensing terms allows you to proceed to the next step.

4. When you get to the **Offline installation** page, in **Install Path**, specify the folder containing the CAB files you copied earlier.

5. Continue following the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

## Set environment variables

For R feature integration only, you should set the **MKL_CBWR** environment variable to [ensure consistent output](https://software.intel.com/articles/introduction-to-the-conditional-numerical-reproducibility-cnr) from Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) calculations.

1. In Control Panel, click **System and Security** > **System** > **Advanced System Settings** > **Environment Variables**.

2. Create a new User or System variable. 

   + Set variable name to `MKL_CBWR`
   + Set the variable value to `AUTO`

This step requires a server restart. If you are about to enable script execution, you can hold off on the restart until all of the configuration work is done.

## Post-install configuration
