# Grant database users permission to execute Python and R scripts with SQL Server Machine Learning Services
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2016 SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016-asdbmi.md)]

Learn how you can give a [database user](../../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/create-a-database-user.md) permission to run external Python and R scripts in [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../sql-server-machine-learning-services.md) and give read, write, or data definition language (DDL) permissions to databases.

For more information, see the permissions section in [Security overview for the extensibility framework](../../machine-learning/concepts/security.md#permissions).

## Permission to run scripts

For each user who runs Python or R scripts with SQL Server Machine Learning Services, and who are not an administrator, you must grant them the permission to run external scripts in each database where the language is used.

To grant permission to a [database user](../../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/create-a-database-user.md) to execute external script, run the following script:

```sql
USE <database_name>
GO
GRANT EXECUTE ANY EXTERNAL SCRIPT TO [UserName]
```

> [!NOTE]
> Permissions are not specific to the supported script language. In other words, there are not separate permission levels for R script versus Python script.

## Grant database permissions

While a database user is running scripts, the database user might need to read data from other databases. The database user might also need to create new tables to store results, and write data into tables.

For each database user account or SQL login that is running R or Python scripts, ensure that it has the appropriate permissions on the specific database: 

+ `db_datareader` to read data.
+ `db_datawriter` to save objects to the database.
+ `db_ddladmin` to create objects such as stored procedures or tables containing trained and serialized data.

For example, the following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement gives the SQL login *MySQLLogin* the rights to run T-SQL queries in the *ML_Samples* database. To run this statement, the SQL login must already exist in the security context of the server. For more information, see [sp_addrolemember (Transact-SQL)](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-addrolemember-transact-sql.md).

```sql
USE ML_Samples
GO
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datareader', 'MySQLLogin'
```
