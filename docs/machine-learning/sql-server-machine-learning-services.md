# What is SQL Server Machine Learning Services with Python and R?
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2017 SQL and Managed Instance](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2017-asdbmi.md)]

Machine Learning Services is a feature in SQL Server that gives the ability to run Python and R scripts with relational data. You can use open-source packages and frameworks, and the [Microsoft Python and R packages](#packages), for predictive analytics and machine learning. The scripts are executed in-database without moving data outside SQL Server or over the network. This article explains the basics of SQL Server Machine Learning Services and how to get started.

## Execute Python and R scripts in SQL Server

SQL Server Machine Learning Services lets you execute Python and R scripts in-database. You can use it to prepare and clean data, do feature engineering, and train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models within a database. The feature runs your scripts where the data resides and eliminates transfer of the data across the network to another server.

You can execute Python and R scripts on a SQL Server instance with the stored procedure [sp_execute_external_script](../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md).

Base distributions of Python and R are included in Machine Learning Services. You can install and use open-source packages and frameworks, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn, in addition to the Microsoft packages.

Machine Learning Services uses an extensibility framework to run Python and R scripts in SQL Server. Learn more about how this works:

+ [Python extension](concepts/extension-python.md)
+ [R extension](concepts/extension-r.md)

## Get started with Machine Learning Services

::: moniker range=">=sql-server-ver15||>=sql-server-linux-ver15||=azuresqldb-mi-current"
1. [Install SQL Server Machine Learning Services on Windows](install/sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install.md) or [on Linux](../linux/sql-server-linux-setup-machine-learning.md?toc=/sql/machine-learning/toc.json). You can also use [Machine Learning Services on Big Data Clusters](../big-data-cluster/machine-learning-services.md) and [Machine Learning Services in Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/machine-learning-services-overview).

1. Configure your development tools. You can use [run Python and R scripts in Azure Data Studio notebooks](install/sql-machine-learning-azure-data-studio.md). You can also run T-SQL in [Azure Data Studio](../azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio.md).

1. Write your first Python or R script.

## Python and R packages

You can use open-source packages and frameworks, in addition to Microsoft's enterprise packages. Most common open-source Python and R packages are pre-installed in Machine Learning Services. 

> [!NOTE]
> Beginning with [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)], runtimes for R, Python, and Java, are no longer installed with SQL Setup. Instead, install your desired R and/or Python custom runtime(s) and packages. For more information, see [Install SQL Server 2022 Machine Learning Services on Windows](install/sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install-sql-2022.md) or [Install SQL Server Machine Learning Services (Python and R) on Linux](../linux/sql-server-linux-setup-machine-learning.md).
