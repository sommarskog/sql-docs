# Tutorial: Develop a clustering model in R with SQL machine learning

In this four-part tutorial series, you'll use R to develop and deploy a K-Means clustering model in [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../sql-server-machine-learning-services.md) or on [Big Data Clusters](../../big-data-cluster/machine-learning-services.md) to categorize customer data.

In part one of this series, you'll set up the prerequisites for the tutorial and then restore a sample dataset to a database. 
In parts two and three, you'll develop some R scripts in an Azure Data Studio notebook to analyze and prepare this sample data and train a machine learning model. Then, in part four, you'll run those R scripts inside a database using stored procedures.

*Clustering* can be explained as organizing data into groups where members of a group are similar in some way. For this tutorial series, imagine you own a retail business. You'll use the **K-Means** algorithm to perform the clustering of customers in a dataset of product purchases and returns. By clustering customers, you can focus your marketing efforts more effectively by targeting specific groups. K-Means clustering is an *unsupervised learning* algorithm that looks for patterns in data based on similarities.

In this article, you'll learn how to:

In [part two](r-clustering-model-prepare-data.md), you'll learn how to prepare the data from a database to perform clustering.

In [part three](r-clustering-model-build.md), you'll learn how to create and train a K-Means clustering model in R.

In [part four](r-clustering-model-deploy.md),  you'll learn how to create a stored procedure in a database that can perform clustering in R based on new data.

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range=">=sql-server-ver15||>=sql-server-linux-ver15"
* [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../sql-server-machine-learning-services.md) with the Python language option - Follow the installation instructions in the [Windows installation guide](../install/sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install.md) or the [Linux installation guide](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup-machine-learning.md?toc=%252fsql%252fmachine-learning%252ftoc.json&view=sql-server-linux-ver15&preserve-view=true). You can also [enable Machine Learning Services on SQL Server Big Data Clusters](../../big-data-cluster/machine-learning-services.md).

* [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../sql-server-machine-learning-services.md) with the R language option - Follow the installation instructions in the [Windows installation guide](../install/sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install.md).
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="=azuresqldb-mi-current"
* Azure SQL Managed Instance Machine Learning Services. For information, see the [Azure SQL Managed Instance Machine Learning Services overview](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/machine-learning-services-overview).

* [SQL Server Management Studio](../../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md) for restoring the sample database to Azure SQL Managed Instance.
::: moniker-end

* [Azure Data Studio](../../azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio.md). You'll use a notebook in Azure Data Studio for SQL. For more information about notebooks, see [How to use notebooks in Azure Data Studio](../../azure-data-studio/notebooks/notebooks-guidance.md).

* R IDE - This tutorial uses [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

* RODBC - This driver is used in the R scripts you'll develop in this tutorial. If it's not already installed, install it using the R command `install.packages("RODBC")`. For more information on RODBC, see [CRAN - Package RODBC](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RODBC).

## Restore the sample database

The sample dataset used in this tutorial has been saved to a **.bak** database backup file for you to download and use. This dataset is derived from the [tpcx-bb](http://www.tpc.org/tpcx-bb/default5.asp) dataset provided by the [Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC)](http://www.tpc.org/).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Machine Learning Services on Big Data Clusters, see how to [Restore a database into the SQL Server big data cluster master instance](../../big-data-cluster/data-ingestion-restore-database.md).
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=sql-server-2017||>=sql-server-linux-ver15"
1. Download the file [tpcxbb_1gb.bak](https://rserverdistribution.blob.core.windows.net/production/sqlmldocument/tpcxbb_1gb.bak).

1. Follow the directions in [Restore a database from a backup file](../../azure-data-studio/tutorial-backup-restore-sql-server.md#restore-a-database-from-a-backup-file) in Azure Data Studio, using these details:

   * Import from the **tpcxbb_1gb.bak** file you downloaded
   * Name the target database "tpcxbb_1gb"

1. You can verify that the dataset exists after you have restored the database by querying the **dbo.customer** table:

    ```sql
    USE tpcxbb_1gb;
    SELECT * FROM [dbo].[customer];
    ```

1. Download the file [tpcxbb_1gb.bak](https://rserverdistribution.blob.core.windows.net/production/sqlmldocument/tpcxbb_1gb.bak).

1. Follow the directions in [Restore a database to a Managed Instance](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-get-started-restore) in SQL Server Management Studio, using these details:

   * Import from the **tpcxbb_1gb.bak** file you downloaded
   * Name the target database "tpcxbb_1gb"

1. You can verify that the dataset exists after you have restored the database by querying the **dbo.customer** table:

    ```sql
    USE tpcxbb_1gb;
    SELECT * FROM [dbo].[customer];
    ```

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue with this tutorial, delete the tpcxbb_1gb database.

## Next steps

In part one of this tutorial series, you completed these steps:
