# Python Tutorial: Prepare data to train a linear regression model with SQL machine learning
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2017 SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2017-asdbmi.md)]

In part two of this four-part tutorial series, you'll prepare data from a database using Python. Later in this series, you'll use this data to train and deploy a linear regression model in Python with SQL Server Machine Learning Services or on SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters.

In this article, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Load the data from the database into a **pandas** data frame
> * Prepare the data in Python by removing some columns

In [part one](python-ski-rental-linear-regression.md), you learned how to restore the sample database.

In [part three](python-ski-rental-linear-regression-train-model.md), you'll learn how to train a linear regression machine learning model in Python.

In [part four](python-ski-rental-linear-regression-deploy-model.md), you'll learn how to store the model in a database, and then create stored procedures from the Python scripts you developed in parts two and three. The stored procedures will run on the server to make predictions based on new data.

## Prerequisites

* Part two of this tutorial assumes you have completed [part one](python-ski-rental-linear-regression.md) and its prerequisites.

## Explore and prepare the data

To use the data in Python, you'll load the data from the database into a pandas data frame.

Create a new Python notebook in Azure Data Studio and run the script below. 

The Python script below imports the dataset from the `dbo.rental_data` table in your database to a pandas data frame **df**.

In the connection string, replace connection details as needed. To use Windows authentication with an ODBC connection string, specify `Trusted_Connection=Yes;` instead of the `UID` and `PWD` parameters.

```python
import pyodbc
import pandas
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Connection string to your SQL Server instance
conn_str = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}; SERVER=<server>; DATABASE=TutorialDB;UID=<username>;PWD=<password>')

query_str = 'SELECT Year, Month, Day, Rentalcount, Weekday, Holiday, Snow FROM dbo.rental_data'

df = pandas.read_sql(sql=query_str, con=conn_str)
print("Data frame:", df)
```

You should see results similar to the following.

```results
Data frame:      Year  Month  Day  Rentalcount  WeekDay  Holiday  Snow
0    2014      1   20          445        2        1     0
1    2014      2   13           40        5        0     0
2    2013      3   10          456        1        0     0
3    2014      3   31           38        2        0     0
4    2014      4   24           23        5        0     0
..    ...    ...  ...          ...      ...      ...   ...
448  2013      2   19           57        3        0     1
449  2015      3   18           26        4        0     0
450  2015      3   24           29        3        0     1
451  2014      3   26           50        4        0     1
452  2015     12    6          377        1        0     1

[453 rows x 7 columns]
```

Filter the columns from the dataframe to remove ones we don't want to use in the training. `Rentalcount` should not be included as it is the target of the predictions.

```python
columns = df.columns.tolist()
columns = [c for c in columns if c not in ["Year", "Rentalcount"]]

print("Training set:", test[columns])

```

Note the data the training set will have access to:

```results
Training set:      Month  Day  Weekday  Holiday  Snow
1        2   13        5        0     0
3        3   31        2        0     0
7        3    8        7        0     0

421      1   21        3        0     1
438      2   19        4        0     1
441      2    3        3        0     1
447      1    4        6        0     1

[91 rows x 5 columns]
```
