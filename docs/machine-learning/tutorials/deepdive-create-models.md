# Create R models (SQL Server and RevoScaleR tutorial)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2016 and later](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016.md)]

This is tutorial 7 of the [RevoScaleR tutorial series](deepdive-data-science-deep-dive-using-the-revoscaler-packages.md) on how to use [RevoScaleR functions](/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/revoscaler) with SQL Server.

You have enriched the training data. In this tutorial, you'll analyze the data using regression modeling. Linear models are an important tool in the world of predictive analytics. The **RevoScaleR** package includes regression algorithms that can subdivide the workload and run it in parallel.

## Create a linear regression model

In this step, create a simple linear model that estimates the credit card balance for the customers using as independent variables the values in the *gender* and *creditLine* columns.
  
To do this, use the [rxLinMod](/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxlinmod) function, which supports remote compute contexts.
  
1. Create an R variable to store the completed model, and call **rxLinMod**, passing an appropriate formula.
  
    ```R
    linModObj <- rxLinMod(balance ~ gender + creditLine,  data = sqlFraudDS)
    ```
  
2. To view a summary of the results, call the standard R **summary** function on the model object.
  
     ```R
     summary(linModObj)
     ```

You might think it peculiar that a plain R function like **summary** would work here, since in the previous step, you set the compute context to the server. However, even when the **rxLinMod** function uses the remote compute context to create the model, it also returns an object that contains the model to your local workstation, and stores it in the shared directory.

Therefore, you can run standard R commands against the model just as if it had been created using the "local" context.

**Results**

```

## Create a logistic regression model

Next, create a logistic regression model that indicates whether a particular customer is a fraud risk. You'll use the **RevoScaleR** [rxLogit](/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxlogit) function, which supports fitting of logistic regression models in remote compute contexts.

Keep the compute context as is. You'll also continue to use the same data source as well.

1. Call the **rxLogit** function and pass the formula needed to define the model.

    ```R
    logitObj <- rxLogit(fraudRisk ~ state + gender + cardholder + balance + numTrans + numIntlTrans + creditLine, data = sqlFraudDS, dropFirst = TRUE)
    ```
  
    Because it is a large model, containing 60 independent variables, including three dummy variables that are dropped, you might have to wait some time for the compute context to return the object.
    
    The reason the model is so large is that, in R and in the **RevoScaleR** package, every level of a categorical factor variable is automatically treated as a separate dummy variable.
  
2. To view a summary of the returned model, call the R **summary** function.
  
    ```R
    summary(logitObj)
    ```
  
**Partial results**

```R
Logistic Regression Results for: fraudRisk ~ state + gender + cardholder + balance + numTrans + numIntlTrans + creditLine
