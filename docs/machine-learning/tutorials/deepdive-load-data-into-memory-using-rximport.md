# Load data into memory using rxImport (SQL Server and RevoScaleR tutorial)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2016 and later](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016.md)]

This is tutorial 10 of the [RevoScaleR tutorial series](deepdive-data-science-deep-dive-using-the-revoscaler-packages.md) on how to use [RevoScaleR functions](/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/revoscaler) with SQL Server.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to get data from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and then use the **rxImport** function to put the data of interest into a local file. That way, you can analyze it in the local compute context repeatedly, without having to re-query the database.

The [rxImport](/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rximport) function can be used to move data from a data source into a data frame in session memory, or into an XDF file on disk. If you don't specify a file as destination, data is put into memory as a data frame.

## Extract a subset of data from SQL Server to local memory

You've decided that you want to examine only the high risk individuals in more detail. The source table in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is big, so you want to get the information about just the high-risk customers. You then load that data into a data frame in the memory of the local workstation.

1. Reset the compute context to your local workstation.

    ```R
    rxSetComputeContext("local")
    ```

2. Create a new SQL Server data source object, providing a valid SQL statement in the *sqlQuery* parameter. This example gets a subset of the observations with the highest risk scores. That way, only the data you really need is put in local memory.

    ```R
    sqlServerProbDS \<- RxSqlServerData(
        sqlQuery = paste("SELECT * FROM ccScoreOutput2",
        "WHERE (ccFraudProb > .99)"),
        connectionString = sqlConnString)
    ```

3. Call the function [rxImport](/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rximport) to read the data into a data frame in the local R session.

    ```R
    highRisk <- rxImport(sqlServerProbDS)
    ```

    If the operation was successful, you should see a status message like this one: "Rows Read: 35, Total Rows Processed: 35, Total Chunk Time: 0.036 seconds"

4. Now that the high-risk observations are in an in-memory data frame, you can use various R functions to manipulate the data frame. For example, you can order customers by their risk score, and print a list of the customers who pose the highest risk.

    ```R
    orderedHighRisk <- highRisk[order(-highRisk$ccFraudProb),]
    row.names(orderedHighRisk) <- NULL
    head(orderedHighRisk)
    ```

**Results**

```R
ccFraudLogitScore   state gender cardholder balance numTrans numIntlTrans creditLine ccFraudProb1
9.786345    SD   Male  Principal   23456       25            5 75   0.99994382

```

## More about rxImport

You can use **rxImport** not just to move data, but to transform data in the process of reading it. For example, you can specify the number of characters for fixed-width columns, provide a description of the variables, set levels for factor columns, and even create new levels to use after importing.

The **rxImport** function assigns variable names to the columns during the import process, but you can indicate new variable names by using the *colInfo* parameter, or change data types using the *colClasses* parameter.

By specifying additional operations in the *transforms* parameter, you can do elementary processing on each chunk of data that is read.
