# Check for Updates Dialog Box

Beginning in the November 2012 release of SQL Server Data Tools, you see a **Check for Updates** menu option under the **SQL** menu.  
  
The **Check for Updates** dialog box displays the version of SQL Server Data Tools that is installed on your computer, and the released version. An **Update** displays if the released version is later than the installed version. Click the **Update** button to see a description of the available updates, and, if you choose, install the most recent SQL Server Data Tools version on your computer.  
  
The **Check for Updates** dialog box also has an **Automatically check for updates to SQL Server Data Tools** check box. When checked, SQL Server Data Tools displays a description of available updates when Visual Studio starts. You can choose to install those updates.
