# DAC Framework Compatibility

When you attempt an action that uses the DAC Framework, SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) verifies the version of DACFx on the computer. If SSDT does not work with the installed version of DACFx, the following error displays:

**Incompatible versions of SQL Server Data Tools and database runtime components are installed on this computer**

You can download a newer version of SSDT from [Install Latest SQL Server Data Tools](./download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md).
