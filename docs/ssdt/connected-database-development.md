# Connected Database Development

This section describes features provided by SQL Server Data Tools for designing and querying a connected database.  
  
Using the SQL Server Object Explorer in Visual Studio, developers can now create, edit and browse database objects located in either an on-premises database server, such as SQL Server 2008 or Microsoft SQL Server 2012, or off-premise in SQL Azure. Developers can easily clone an existing production database to a test instance, perform additional development work on it, and publish the changes back to the production database.
