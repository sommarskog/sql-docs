# Data Tools Operations Window

The **Data Tools Operations**  window shows the progress of some operations discussed in this topic, and notifies you of any errors.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
> Some operations (for example, publishing) will open the window automatically. For some other operations, you need to make sure the window is open. You can turn this option off by unchecking **Show Data Tools Operations for high-priority operations** located under Tools > Options > SQL Server Tools > General.  
  
To view the **Data Tools Operations** window, select **View** menu, then **Other Windows**, and then **Data Tools Operations**.  
  
The **Data Tools Operations** window shows the progress when you perform the following operations:  
  
-   Expanding a database in the **SQL Server Object Explorer**. This operation starts an import of the database model.  
  
-   Committing changes to a database or generating scripts through the **Update Database** button in the Transact\-SQL Editor. For more information, see [How to: Update a Connected Database with Power Buffer](../ssdt/how-to-update-a-connected-database-with-power-buffer.md).  
  
-   Deleting an object from the **SQL Server Object Explorer**. For more information, see [How to: Delete Objects and Resolve Dependencies](../ssdt/how-to-delete-objects-and-resolve-dependencies.md).  
  
-   Publishing results. For more information, [How to: Change Target Platform and Publish a Database Project](../ssdt/how-to-change-target-platform-and-publish-a-database-project.md)  
  
-   Deploying. For more information, see [How to: Build and Deploy to a Local Database](../ssdt/how-to-build-and-deploy-to-a-local-database.md).
