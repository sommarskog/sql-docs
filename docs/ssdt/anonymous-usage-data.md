# SQL Server Data Tools usage and diagnostic data collection

The SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) component is enabled through the Data workload in Visual Studio.  The Visual Studio Customer Experience Improvement Program (VSCEIP) is designed to help Microsoft improve Visual Studio over time. This program collects information about errors, computer hardware, and how people use Visual Studio, without interrupting users in their tasks at the computer.

For more information about the VSCEIP, including how to opt in or opt out, see the [VSCEIP Overview](/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-experience-improvement-program).

For more information about the system-generated diagnostic logs collected, see the documentation on [system-generated logs](/visualstudio/ide/diagnostic-data-collection).


SSDT doesn't collect your name, address, or any other data related to an identified or identifiable individual. For more information about the information collected, processed, or transmitted by the VSCEIP, see the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).
