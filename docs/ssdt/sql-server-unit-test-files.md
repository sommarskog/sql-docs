# SQL Server Unit Test Files

Like the unit tests for managed code, SQL Server unit tests reside in test projects. You can see the items that compose a SQL Server unit test in the hierarchy of a test project in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
A SQL Server unit test consists of multiple items that are contained in several files. The following table describes the files that interact to form a SQL Server unit test.  
  
|**File**|**Description**|  
|------------|-------------------|  
|.cs or .vb|This source-code file contains a class that is decorated with the [TestClass] attribute. This class contains a single test method for each of the contained SQL Server unit tests. These methods are decorated with the [TestMethod] attribute.<br /><br />Each test method contains the appropriate code to exercise the Transact\-SQL test script. This code is generated when the test methods are created, and you can modify it.<br /><br />**NOTE:** If you double-click this file in **Solution Explorer**, the test class opens in the SQL Server Unit Test Designer. To open the .cs or .vb file to see its source code, right-click the file in **Solution Explorer**, and then click **View Code**.|  
|.resx|This resource file contains the Transact\-SQL scripts for all tests in the associated .cs or .vb file. This group of scripts includes the pre-test script, the test script, and the post-test script. The resource file contains XML, which you can edit. The resource file is compiled into the test assembly.<br /><br />You should code your Transact\-SQL scripts by using the **SQL Server Unit Test Designer**. For more information about the scripts that are used in SQL Server unit tests, see [Scripts in SQL Server Unit Tests](../ssdt/scripts-in-sql-server-unit-tests.md).|  
|app.config|This file stores the database connection strings for the test project, in addition to other SQL Server unit test configuration settings such as command time-out. For more information, see [Scripts in SQL Server Unit Tests](../ssdt/scripts-in-sql-server-unit-tests.md).|  
|SQLDatabaseSetup.cs or SQLDatabaseSetup.vb|This file contains a class that prepares the test environment for all SQL Server unit tests in the test project. Based on the configuration settings in the app.config file, it may deploy a SQL Server Database Project to the test database.|
