# Previous releases of SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT and SSDT-BI)

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) provides project templates and design surfaces for building SQL Server content types - relational databases, Analysis Services models, Reporting Services reports, and Integration Services packages.

SSDT is backwards compatible, so you can always use [the newest SSDT](download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md) to design and deploy databases, models, reports, and packages that run on older versions of SQL Server.

Historically, the Visual Studio shell used to create SQL Server content types has been released under various names, including **SQL Server Data Tools**, **SQL Server Data Tools - Business Intelligence**, and **Business Intelligence Development Studio**. Previous versions came with distinct sets of project templates. To get all of the project templates together in one SSDT, you need [the newest version](download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md). Otherwise, you probably need to install multiple previous versions to get all of the templates used in SQL Server. Only one shell is installed per version of Visual Studio; installing a second SSDT just adds the missing templates.

> [!WARNING]
> Visual Studio 2017 is out of mainstream support and use of Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 is recommended.  Learn more about SSDT for Visual Studio 2019 and 2022 at [Download SSDT](download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md).

Download previous SSDT versions by selecting the download link in the related section.

| SSDT version | Visual Studio version |
| --- | --- |

| [17.4](#ssdt-for-visual-studio-vs-2015) | 2015 |

## SSDT for Visual Studio (VS) 2017

### Changes in SSDT for Visual Studio 2017

Starting with Visual Studio 2017, the functionality of creating Database Projects has been integrated into the Visual Studio installation. There's no need to install the SSDT standalone installer for the core SSDT experience.

Now to create Analysis Services, Integration Services, or Reporting Services projects, you still need the SSDT standalone installer.

### Install SSDT with Visual Studio 2017

To install SSDT during [Visual Studio installation](/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio), select the **Data storage and processing** workload, and then select **SQL Server Data Tools**.

If Visual Studio is already installed, use the Visual Studio Installer to modify the installed workloads to include SSDT.

1. Launch the Visual Studio Installer. In the Windows Start menu, you can search for "installer".

   :::image type="content" source="media/previous-releases-of-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt-and-ssdt-bi/visual-studio-installer.png" alt-text="Visual Studio Installer in the Windows Start menu for 2017.":::

1. In the installer, select for the edition of Visual Studio that you want to add SSDT to, and then choose **Modify**.

1. Select **SQL Server Data Tools** under **Data storage and processing** in the list of workloads.

### Install Analysis Services, Integration Services, and Reporting Services tools

To install Analysis Services, Integration Services, and Reporting Services project support, run the [SSDT standalone installer](#ssdt-for-vs-2017-standalone-installer).

The installer lists available Visual Studio instances to add SSDT tools. If Visual Studio isn't already installed, selecting **Install a new SQL Server Data Tools instance** installs SSDT with a minimal version of Visual Studio, but for the best experience, we recommend using SSDT with [the latest version of Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads).

### Supported SQL versions

| Project Templates | SQL Platforms Supported |
| --- | --- |
| Relational databases | SQL Server 2005\* - SQL Server 2017<br /><br />Azure SQL Database<br /><br />Azure Synapse Analytics (supports queries only; database projects aren't yet supported)<br /><br />\* SQL Server 2005 support is deprecated,<br /><br />move to an officially supported SQL version |

### Considerations and limitations

- You can't install the community version offline

- To upgrade SSDT, you need to follow the same path used to install SSDT. For example, if you added SSDT using the VSIX extensions, then you must upgrade via the VSIX extensions. If you installed SSDT via a separate install, then you need to upgrade using that method.

### Offline install

To install SSDT when you're not connected to the internet, follow the steps in this section. For more information, see [Create a network installation of Visual Studio 2017](/visualstudio/install/create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio).

First, complete the following steps while **online**:

1. [Download the SSDT standalone installer](#ssdt-for-vs-2017-standalone-installer).

1. [Download vs_sql.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vs_sql.exe).

1. While still online, execute one of the following commands to download all the files required for installing offline. Using the `--layout` option is the key, it downloads the actual files for the offline installation. Replace `<filepath>` with the actual layouts path to save the files.

   a. For a specific language, pass the locale: `--lang`. A single language is ~1 GB in size.

   ```dos
   vs_sql.exe --layout c:\<filepath> --lang en-us
   ```

   b. For all languages, omit the `--lang` argument. All languages are ~3.9 GB.

   ```dos
   vs_sql.exe --layout c:\<filepath>
   ```

  After completing the previous steps, the following steps below can be done **offline**:

1. Run this command to install the VS2017 Shell and SQL Server Data Project.

   ```dos
   vs_setup.exe --NoWeb
   ```

1. Run this command to install SSDT

   a. For an interactive installation, from the layouts folder, run this command and select SSIS/SSRS/SSAS

   ```dos
   SSDT-Setup-ENU.exe /install
   ```

   b. For an unattended installation, run this command

   ```dos
   SSDT-Setup-ENU.exe /INSTALLALL[:vsinstances] /passive
   ```

   c. For an unattended installation to a specific VS Instance that you may have previously installed, you can query the instance ID of the desired VS instance

   ```dos
   cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer> vswhere.exe -all
   ```

    Then run this command by replacing the VS_INSTANCE_ID_HERE with your instanceID (it looks something like this: 49cf420b)

    ```dos
    SSDT-Setup-ENU.exe /INSTALLALL[:VS_INSTANCE_ID_HERE] /passive
    ```

For available options, run `SSDT-Setup-ENU.exe /help`

> [!NOTE]  
> If using a full version of Visual Studio 2017, create an offline folder for SSDT only, and run `SSDT-Setup-ENU.exe` from this newly created folder (don't add SSDT to another Visual Studio 2017 offline layout). If you add the SSDT layout to an existing Visual Studio offline layout, the necessary runtime (.exe) components are not created there.

#### 16.5,&nbsp; SSDT for VS 2015

_Released:_ &nbsp; October 20, 2016  
_Build number:_ &nbsp; 14.0.61021.0  
_SSDT for Visual Studio 2015._  
_Supports up to SQL Server 2016._

**What's new?**

##### Connection Improvements

* The new search box in the **Browse** tab helps you filter your Local servers, Network servers, and Azure SQL databases. This is useful if you have a large number of servers or databases appearing in these lists.
* The **History** tab has right-click menu options to pin / unpin favorites, and a new option to remove connections from history.

##### SqlPackage and DacFx API Improvements

Using SqlPackage.exe and the DacFx APIs you can now generate a deployment report, deployment script, and publish to a database all in one action. This is a timesaver for anyone who likes to keep a report of what was published during a deployment. Another benefit is that for Azure scenarios, separate scripts for the master database and the deploy target database are created. Up to now a single script was created which wasn't useful for repeated deployments.

For SqlPackage's Publish and Script actions, two new arguments have been added.

* DeployScriptPath (shortname: dsp). This is an optional path to write the deployment script to. For Azure deployment, if there were TSQL commands to create of modify the DB a master script will be written to the same path but with "Filename_Master.sql" as the output file name.
* DeployReportPath (shortname: drp). This is an optional path to write the deployment report to.

For the Script action, either the existing Output Path arguments or the new script/report-specific arguments should be used, but not both.

Sample usage:

**Publish Action**

```Sqlpackage.exe /a:Publish /tsn:(localdb)\ProjectsV13 /tdn:MyDatabase /deployscriptpath:"My\DeployScript.sql" /deployreportpath:"My\DeployReport.xml"```

**Script Action**

```Sqlpackage.exe /a:Script /tsn:(localdb)\ProjectsV13 /tdn:MyDatabase /deployscriptpath:"My\DeployScript.sql" /deployreportpath:"My\DeployReport.xml"```

In DacFx, two new APIs have been added: DacServices.Publish() and DacServices.Script(). These also support performing publish + script + report actions in a single operation. Sample usage:

```
DacServices service = new DacServices(connectionString);
using(DacPackage package = DacPackage.Load(@"C:\My\db.dacpac")) {
var options = new PublishOptions() {
    GenerateDeploymentScript = true, // Should a deployment script be created?
    GenerateDeploymentReport = true, // Should an xml deploy report be created?
    DatabaseScriptPath = @"C:\My\OutputScript.sql", // optional path to save script to
    MasterDbScriptPath = @"C:\My\OutputScript_Master.sql", // optional path to save master script to
    DeployOptions = new DacDeployOptions()
};

// Call publish and receive deployment script & report in the results
PublishResult result = service.Publish(package, "TargetDb", options);
Console.WriteLine(result.DatabaseScript);
Console.WriteLine(result.MasterDbScript);
Console.WriteLine(result.DeploymentReport);

// Call script and receive deployment script & report in results
result = service.Script(package, "TargetDb", options);
Console.WriteLine(result.DatabaseScript);
Console.WriteLine(result.MasterDbScript);
Console.WriteLine(result.DeploymentReport);
```

**Analysis Services & Reporting Services**

SSAS tabular designer DAX parser has improved performance when working with large DAX expressions.
For more information, please read the [Analysis Services blog post](/archive/blogs/analysisservices/introducing-integrated-workspace-mode-for-sql-server-data-tools-for-analysis-services-tabular-projects-ssdt-tabular).

##### Fixed / Improved this month

**Database Tools**

* [Connect bug 3055711](https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/3055711/columns-can't-be-selected-from-cross-apply-openjson-with-explicit-schema) - Columns can't be selected from CROSS APPLY OPENJSON with explicit schema
* Fixed - issue with Autogenerated History table indexes, where DacFx dropped index on redeployment
* Fixed - issue with DacFx batch parser not parsing escaped bracket ']' characters, which caused publish to fail

#### 16.4, SSDT for VS 2015

_Released:_ &nbsp; September 20, 2016  
_Build number:_ &nbsp; 14.0.60918  
_For SQL Server 2016._

**What's new?**

Schema Compare is now supported in SqlPackage.exe and the Data-Tier Application Framework (DacFx) API. For details, see [Schema Compare in SqlPackage and the Data-Tier Application Framework](/archive/blogs/ssdt/schema-compare-in-sqlpackage-and-the-data-tier-application-framework-dacfx).

**Analysis Services - Integrated Workspace Mode for SSDT Tabular (SSAS)**

SSDT Tabular now includes an internal SSAS instance, which SSDT Tabular starts automatically in the background if integrated workspace mode is enabled so that you can add and view tables, columns, and data in the model designer without having to provide an external workspace server instance. Integrated workspace mode doesn't change how SSDT Tabular works with a workspace server and database. What changes is where SSDT Tabular hosts the workspace database. To enable integrated workspace mode, select the Integrated Workspace option in the Tabular Model Designer dialog box displayed when creating a new tabular project. For existing tabular projects that currently use an explicit workspace server, you can switch to integrated workspace mode by setting the Integrated Workspace Mode parameter to True in the Properties window, which is displayed when you select the Model.bim file in Solution Explorer. For details, see the [Analysis Services blog post](/archive/blogs/analysisservices/introducing-integrated-workspace-mode-for-sql-server-data-tools-for-analysis-services-tabular-projects-ssdt-tabular).

#### 16.3,&nbsp; SSDT for VS 2015

_Released:_ &nbsp; August 15, 2016  
_Build number:_ &nbsp; 14.0.60812.0  
_For SQL Server 2016._

**What's new?**

- **Release Versioning & Numbering:** Releases are now tagged numerically rather than by month. This aligns with the new SSMS policy and simplifies cases where we have multiple releases or hotfixes in a month. This release is 16.3, which means the third update after the RTM release. Any hotfix will be 16.3.1, and so on, with our next update (planned for next month) being 16.4.
- **Analysis Services - Tabular Model Explorer:** Tabular Model Explorer lets you conveniently navigate through the various metadata objects in a model, such as data sources, tables, measures, and relationships. It's implemented as a separate tools window that you can display by opening the View menu in Visual Studio, pointing to Other Windows, and then clicking Tabular Model Explorer. The Tabular Model Explorer appears by default in the Solution Explorer area on a separate tab. Tabular Model Explorer organizes the metadata objects in a tree structure that closely resembles the schema of a tabular 1200 model and many more new features.
- **Database Tools - Always Encrypted**:  This release provides new [Always Encrypted Key management](../relational-databases/security/encryption/overview-of-key-management-for-always-encrypted.md) dialogs to easily add Column Master Keys or Column Encryption Keys to your database project, or a live database in SQL Server Object Explorer. This release supports certificates in Windows Certificate Store.
    - While creating Column Master Key or Column Encryption Key, you may experience that the changes aren't reflected on SQL Server Object Explorer immediately after clicking Update Database. To work around, refresh the database node in SQL Server Object Explorer.
    - If you try to encrypt a column in a table with data from SQL Server Object Explorer, you may experience a failure. This feature is currently supported only in SSDT database projects and SSMS.

**Updates and fixes**

#### July 2016,&nbsp; SSDT for VS 2015

_Released:_ &nbsp; June 30, 2016  
_Build number:_ &nbsp; 14.0.60629.0  
_For SQL Server 2016._

**What's new?**  
- **Always Encrypted support:** For Databases that contain Always Encrypted columns, this release adds full support for Always Encrypted through our core APIs and command-line tool (SqlPackage.exe). You can build and publish database projects with full support for all Always Encrypted features.  
- **Temporal Tables enhanced support:** Simplified the experience by unlinking temporal tables before alterations and relinking once these have completed. This means that Temporal Tables have parity with other table types (standard, in-memory) in terms of the operations that are supported. 
- **SqlPackage.exe and installation changes:** Changes to isolate SSDT from SQL Server engine and SSMS updates. For details, see [Changes to SSDT and SqlPackage.exe installation and updates](/archive/blogs/ssdt/changes-to-ssdt-and-sqlpackage-exe-installation-and-updates).


**Updates and fixes**
* **Database tools:**
    * From now on SSDT will never disable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) on a database. Previously since the default encryption option in a project's database settings was disabled, it would turn off encryption. With this fix encryption can be enabled but never disabled during publish. 
    * Increased the retry count and resiliency for Azure SQL Database connections during initial connection.
    * If the default filegroup isn't PRIMARY, Import/Publish to Azure V12 would fail. Now this setting is ignored when publishing.
    * Fixed an issue where when exporting a database with an object with Quoted Identifier on, export validation could fail in some instances.
    * Fixed an issue where the TEXTIMAGE_ON option was incorrectly added for Hekaton table creations where it isn't allowed.
    * Fixed an issue where Export took a long time exporting with large amount of data due to a write to the model.xml file after data phase completed caused contents of the .bacpac file to be rewritten.
    * Fixed an issue where Users weren't appearing in the Security folder for Azure SQL DW and APS connections.

* **Analysis Services & Reporting Services:**
    * Fixed a SxS issue with MSOLAP OLEDB provider where only the 32-bit provider was getting installed, impacting 64-bit Excel 2016 connecting to SQL Server 2014 (didn't repro with ClickOnce installs from Office 365, only MSI Excel install).
    * Fixed an issue for a corner case to be more robust when upgrading AS model with pasted tables from 1103 to 1200 compatibility level that could give error "Relationship uses an invalid column ID".
    * Fixed a SxS issue when SSDT-BI 2013 on same machine, could no longer import data in AS model after uninstalling SSDT 2015 (cartridges shared registry setting).
    * Improved robustness to address issues\crashes when the connection to the AS engine is lost (i.e. SSDT left open overnight and AS server recycled, or other cases where the connection is temporarily lost). 
    * Fixed issues with dialogs opening on different screens than VS in multi-monitor scenarios. 
    * Fixed/enabled support for pasting from HTML tables (grid data) in AS model pasted tables. 
    * Fixed issue where upgrade failed to upgrade an empty pasted table to 1200 (used only as container table for measures). 
    * Fixed an issue with upgrading AS tabular model with pasted tables to 1200 to work around an AS engine issue with CalcTables (which are used for Pasted Tables in 1200), to perform a process full on the new calc tables after the upgrade. 
    * Fixed an issue where canceling creation of new AS 1200 model calculated table with incomplete DAX expression could crash. 
    * Fixed an issue importing 1200 model from AS server into SSDT AS project when DB name and a table name were the same. 
    * Fixed an issue with editing KPI measure in 1103 tabular model. 
    * Fixed an Object reference not set exception hit while pasting a KPI measure in the grid for an AS 1200 model. 
    * Fixed an issue where a column in a calculated table couldn't be deleted from the diagram view in 1200 models. 
    * Fixed an Object Reference not set exception when viewing the model.bim project file properties while in code view. 
    * Fixed an issue with pasting data into AS model grid to create pasted table yielded incorrect values on international locales using comma as decimal separator. 
    * Fixed an issue opening 2008 RS project in SSDT and choosing to not upgrade it. 
    * Fixed issue in 1200 compatibility level models calculated table UI when using default formatting for column type to allow changing the formatting type from the UI.
