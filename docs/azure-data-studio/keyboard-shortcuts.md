# Keyboard shortcuts in Azure Data Studio

This article provides the steps to quickly view, edit, and create keyboard shortcuts in Azure Data Studio.

Because Azure Data Studio inherits its key binding functionality from Visual Studio Code, detailed information about advanced customizations, using different keyboard layouts, etc., is in the [Key Bindings for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) article. Some key binding features may not be available (for example, Keymap extensions are not supported in Azure Data Studio).

## Open the Keyboard Shortcuts editor

To view all currently defined keyboard shortcuts:

Open the **Keyboard Shortcuts** editor from the **File** menu: **File** > **Preferences** > **Keyboard Shortcuts** (**Azure Data Studio** > **Preferences** > **Keyboard Shortcuts** on Mac).

In addition to displaying current key bindings, the **Keyboard Shortcuts** editor lists the available commands that do not have keyboard shortcuts defined. The **Keyboard Shortcuts** editor enables you to easily change, remove, reset, and define new key bindings.  

## Edit existing keyboard shortcuts

To change the key binding for an existing keyboard shortcut:

1. Locate the keyboard shortcut you want to change by using the search box or scrolling through the list.
   > [!TIP]
   > Search by key, by command, by source, etc. to return all relevant keyboard shortcuts.

2. Right-click the desired entry and select **Change Key binding**

3. Press the desired combination of keys, then press **Enter** to save it.

## Create new keyboard shortcuts
