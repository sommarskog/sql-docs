## Install Azure Data Studio

### Windows installation

[!INCLUDE [ssms-ads-install](../includes/ssms-azure-data-studio-install.md)]

This release of Azure Data Studio includes a standard Windows installer experience and a .zip file.

We recommend the *user installer*, which simplifies installations and updates and doesn't require Administrator privileges. (It doesn't require Administrator privileges because the location is under your user Local AppData (LOCALAPPDATA) folder.) The user installer also provides a smoother background update experience. For more information, see [User setup for Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_26#_user-setup-for-windows).

**User installer** (recommended)

1. Download and run the [Azure Data Studio user installer for Windows](https://azuredatastudio-update.azurewebsites.net/latest/win32-x64-user/stable).

1. Start the Azure Data Studio app.

**System installer**

1. Download and run the [Azure Data Studio system installer for Windows](https://azuredatastudio-update.azurewebsites.net/latest/win32-x64/stable).

1. Start the Azure Data Studio app.

**.zip file**

1. Download the [Azure Data Studio .zip file for Windows](https://azuredatastudio-update.azurewebsites.net/latest/win32-x64-archive/stable).

1. Go to the downloaded file and extract it.

1. Run `\azuredatastudio-windows\azuredatastudio.exe`.

#### Unattended installation for Windows

You can also install Azure Data Studio by using a command prompt script.

For Windows, install Azure Data Studio in the background without prompts using the following steps:

1. Open the command prompt window with elevated permissions.

1. Run the following command:

   ```console
   <path where the azuredatastudio-windows-user-setup-x.xx.x.exe file is located> /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode>
   ```

   Example:

   ```console
   %systemdrive%\azuredatastudio-windows-user-setup-1.24.0.exe /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The following example also works with the system installer file.

   > ```console
   > <path where the azuredatastudio-windows-setup-x.xx.x.exe file is located> /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode>
   > ```
   >
   > In the preceding code, you can also pass */SILENT* instead of */VERYSILENT* to see the setup user interface.

1. If you've run the commands successfully, you can see Azure Data Studio installed.

### macOS installation

1. Download [Azure Data Studio for macOS](https://azuredatastudio-update.azurewebsites.net/latest/darwin-universal/stable).

1. To expand the contents of the .zip file, double-click it.

1. To make Azure Data Studio available in Launchpad, drag the *Azure Data Studio.app* file to the *Applications* folder.

> [!NOTE]  
> For Apple Silicon users, please make sure you have Rosetta 2 installed. Some backend services are yet to be converted to native ARM64 binaries. You can run the following command in a Terminal window to install Rosetta 2.
