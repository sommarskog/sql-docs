# Preview features in Azure Data Studio

In Azure Data Studio, new features and improvements are often first released as preview features before they're made generally available (GA). The amount of time a feature remains in preview can vary based on user feedback, quality checks, and long-term road maps. By enabling preview features, you get full access to Azure Data Studio features and the chance to provide early feedback.

## How do I enable preview features?

### On first launch

If you're a new user, you can opt into preview features when you launch Azure Data Studio for the first time. On startup, a toast notification will appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen that gives you the option to enable or disable preview features. Select **Yes (recommended)** to enable preview features.

### In Settings

You can enable or disable preview features anytime in your Settings.

1. Select the **Gear** icon in the bottom-left corner and then select **Settings** from the context menu. The Settings tab will open.
