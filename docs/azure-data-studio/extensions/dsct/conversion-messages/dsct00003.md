# DSCT00003: Identifier was not resolved (Error)

This article covers the reason why Database Schema Conversion Toolkit isn't able to resolve an identifier reference.

## Background

To perform correct schema conversion, the Database Schema Conversion Toolkit needs to establish object references within the database schema. This process is referred to as "binding" or "linking". During this process, Database Schema Conversion Toolkit attempts to match object references with their declarations. If Database Schema Conversion Toolkit cann't find a suitable declaration for the encountered object reference, then `DSCT00003` error message is produced.

## Example

Consider the below table definition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES
(
    ID INT NOT NULL,
    NAME VARCHAR(20),
    DEPARTMENT_ID INT 
        REFERENCES DEPARTMENTS (ID)
)
```

Without any additional table definitions included in the conversion, Database Schema Conversion Toolkit will not be able to resolve the foreign key reference to `DEPARTMENTS.ID` and validate that its data type matches the `DEPARTMENTS_ID` column, which the target database might require.

## Possible remedies

To eliminate these types of errors, make sure all referenced objects are included in the conversion.
