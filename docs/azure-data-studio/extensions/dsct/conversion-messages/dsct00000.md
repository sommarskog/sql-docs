# DSCT00000: Failed to parse SQL fragment (Error)

This article covers the reason why Database Schema Conversion Toolkit isn't able to parse input SQL text.

## Background

The Database Schema Conversion Toolkit contains a custom implementation of the parser for different SQL dialects to understand and interpret definitions of objects in the source database. Such custom parser implementation may not support the entire spectrum of statements and clauses, or may have some discrepancies compared to the actual database engine. Database Schema Conversion Toolkit will produce a `DSCT00000` error in the converted output if an unsupported statement or clause is encountered.

## Possible remedies

Statements and clauses that cannot be parsed will need to be converted manually.
