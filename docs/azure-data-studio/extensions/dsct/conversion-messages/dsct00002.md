# DSCT00002: Conversion of syntax element is not supported (Error)

This article covers the reason why Database Schema Conversion Toolkit isn't able to convert certain syntax elements.

## Background

When it comes to automated database schema conversion, there are cases when some clauses are not converted. This can be due to multiple different reasons.

The most common are:

- Conversion of a certain clause isn't yet implemented in the Database Schema Conversion Toolkit
- Conversion of the clause can't be automated because target platform doesn't provide similar functionality, and this functionality can't be emulated

## Example

To better understand how limitations of the target platform affect the conversion, consider the following table definition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES
(
    ID INT NOT NULL,
    NAME VARCHAR2(20),
    DEPARTMENT_ID INT
        REFERENCES DEPARTMENTS (ID)
)
```

When converting this table definition targeting Azure Synapse, a `DSCT00002` error message will be produced, as Azure Synapse doesn't currently support foreign key constraints.

## Possible remedies

Clauses that can't be automatically converted will need to be converted manually.

> [!NOTE]
> When migrating from Oracle database to Microsoft SQL platform, you may also consider using [SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle](../../../../ssma/oracle/sql-server-migration-assistant-for-oracle-oracletosql.md), which provides automated conversion for an extended set of clauses, but can only be used on Windows.
