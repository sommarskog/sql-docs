# DSCT01103: Synonym will be defined in the default schema (Warning)

This article covers the reason why Database Schema Conversion Toolkit changes the schema in which synonym is defined.

## Background

Oracle database supports public synonyms which can be accessed from any schema without an explicit schema prefix. Microsoft SQL only supports synonyms defined within a schema of the database and not globally.

## Example

Consider the below public synonym:

```sql
CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM PUBSYN
    FOR "EXAMPLE"."TABLE1"
```

Since given synonym is defined as "public", the Database Schema Conversion Toolkit will not produce any explicit schema reference in the converted code and synonym will be created in the default schema for the target database.

## Possible remedies

Make sure all references outside of the converted code to the synonym are updated to include schema identifier.
