# DSCT01001: Index will be defined in the schema of the target table (Info)

This article covers the reason why Database Schema Conversion Toolkit may change the schema in which the index is defined.

## Background

Some database platforms allow indexes to be defined in a schema different than that of a target table. In Microsoft SQL indexes always exist in the same schema as a target table.

## Example

Consider the following table and index definitions as an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE SCHEMA_A.EXAMPLE
(
    COLUMN1 INT
);

CREATE INDEX SCHEMA_B.IX_EXAMPLE_COLUMN1
    ON SCHEMA_A.EXAMPLE (COLUMN1)
```

Since table `EXAMPLE` is defined in `SCHEMA_A`, but the index `IX_EXAMPLE_COLUMN1` targeting said table is defined in `SCHEMA_B`, Database Schema Conversion Toolkit produces `DSCT01001` informational message.

## Possible remedies

In general, this shouldn't be a concern, but Database Schema Conversion Toolkit produces an informational message, so that you can review and make sure there are no other dependencies on the index location, or all dependencies are updated to work with the new location.
