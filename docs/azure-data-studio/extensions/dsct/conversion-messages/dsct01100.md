# DSCT01100: Decimal floating-point data type was changed to binary floating-point to preserve scale (Warning)

This article covers the reason why Database Schema Conversion Toolkit may change data type from decimal floating-point to binary floating-point.

## Background

Oracle database support decimal floating-point data types that allow higher scale than Microsoft SQL `decimal`/`numeric` data types. For example Oracle's `NUMBER` data type represents decimal floating-point and allows scale ranging from `-84` to `127`, compared to maximum allowed `38` for Microsoft SQL `decimal`/`numeric` data types. In order to preserve the scale in such cases, the Database Schema Conversion Toolkit will change the data type to `float`.

## Example

Consider the following Oracle table definitions as an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE EXAMPLE
(
    COLUMN1 NUMBER(10, 50)
)
```

The `NUMBER(10, 50)` data type allows `10` significant decimal digits at a scale of `10^50`. Such values will not fit into the Microsoft SQL `decimal`/`numeric` data types.

## Possible remedies

Ensure that use of binary floating-point is acceptable. If full decimal precision is required by the application scenario, consider using `VARCHAR` datatype to store numbers as-is.
