# Manage authentication to SQL Server in PowerShell

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

By default, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PowerShell components use Windows Authentication when connecting to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)]. You can use SQL Server Authentication by either defining a PowerShell virtual drive, or by specifying the **-Username** and **-Password** parameters for **Invoke-Sqlcmd**.

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-powershell-version](../includes/sql-server-powershell-version.md)]

## Permissions

All actions you can perform in an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] are controlled by the permissions granted to the authentication credentials used to connect to the instance. By default, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provider and cmdlets use the Windows account under which it is running to make a Windows Authentication connection to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)].  

To make a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication connection you must supply a SQL Server Authentication login ID and password. When using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provider, you must associate the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login credentials with a virtual drive, and then use the change directory command (**cd**) to connect to that drive. In Windows PowerShell, security credentials can only be associated with virtual drives.  

## SQL Server Authentication Using a Virtual Drive

### To create a virtual drive associated with a SQL Server Authentication login

1. Create a function that:

    1. Has parameters for the name to give the virtual drive, the login ID, and the provider path to associate with the virtual drive.

    2. Uses **read-host** to prompt the user for the password.  

    3. Uses **new-object** to create a credentials object.  

    4. Uses **new-psdrive** to create a virtual drive with the supplied credentials.  

2. Invoke the function to create a virtual drive with the supplied credentials.  

#### Example (Virtual Drive)

This example creates a function named **sqldrive** that you can use to create a virtual drive that is associated with the specified [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication login and instance.  
  
 The **sqldrive** function prompts you to enter the password for your login, masking the password as you type it in. Then, whenever you use the change directory command (**cd**) to connect to a path by using the virtual drive name, all operations are performed by using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication login credentials that you supplied when you created the drive.  
  
```powershell
## Create a function that specifies the login and prompts for the password.  
  
function sqldrive  
{  
    param( [string]$name, [string]$login = "MyLogin", [string]$root = "SQLSERVER:\SQL\MyComputer\MyInstance" )  
    $pwd = read-host -AsSecureString -Prompt "Password"  
    $cred = new-object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist $login,$pwd  
    New-PSDrive $name -PSProvider SqlServer -Root $root -Credential $cred -Scope 1  
}  
  
## Use the sqldrive function to create a SQLAuth virtual drive.  
sqldrive SQLAuth
  
## Set-Location to the virtual drive, which invokes the supplied authentication credentials.  
sl SQLAuth:
```

## SQL Server Authentication Using Invoke-Sqlcmd

### To use Invoke-Sqlcmd with SQL Server Authentication

1. Use the **-Username** parameter to specify a login ID, and the **-Password** parameter to specify the associated password.  

#### Example (Invoke-Sqlcmd)

This example uses the read-host cmdlet to prompt the user for a password, and then connects using SQL Server Authentication.  

```powershell
## Prompt the user for their password.  
$pwd = read-host -AsSecureString -Prompt "Password"  
  
Invoke-Sqlcmd -Query "SELECT GETDATE() AS TimeOfQuery;" -ServerInstance "MyComputer\MyInstance" -Username "MyLogin" -Password $pwd  
```
