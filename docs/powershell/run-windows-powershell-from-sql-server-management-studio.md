# Run Windows PowerShell from SQL Server Management Studio

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

You can start Windows PowerShell sessions from **Object Explorer** in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). SSMS launches Windows PowerShell, loads the **SqlServer** module, and sets the path context to the associated node in the **Object Explorer** tree.

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-powershell-version](../includes/sql-server-powershell-version.md)]

When you specify running PowerShell for an object in **Object Explorer**, SQL Server Management Studio starts a Windows PowerShell session in which the SQL Server PowerShell snap-ins have been loaded and registered. The path for the session is preset to the location of the object you right-clicked in Object Explorer.

For example, if you right-click the AdventureWorks database object in Object Explorer and select **Start PowerShell**, the Windows PowerShell path is set as seen below:

```powershell
SQLSERVER:\SQL\MyComputer\MyInstance\Databases\AdventureWorks2022>
```

## Run PowerShell

### Run PowerShell from SQL Server Management Studio

1. Open **Object Explorer**.

1. Navigate to the node for the object to be worked on.

1. Right-click the object and select **Start PowerShell**.

## Permissions

When opened from SQL Server Management Studio, PowerShell doesn't run with Administrator privileges, which may prevent some activities such as calls to WMI.
