# How to enable the TCP protocol

## How to enable the TCP protocol when connected to the console with SQLPS.

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-powershell-version](../includes/sql-server-powershell-version.md)]

1. Open a command prompt and type:

    ```console
    C:\> SQLPS.EXE
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If SQLPS is not found, you may need to open a new command prompt or just log-off and log back on.

2. At the PowerShell command prompt, type:

    ```powershell
    # Instantiate a ManagedComputer object which exposes primitives to control the
    # installation of SQL Server on this machine.

    $wmi = New-Object 'Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Wmi.ManagedComputer' localhost

    # Enable the TCP protocol on the default instance. If the instance is named, 
    # replace MSSQLSERVER with the instance name in the following line.

    $tcp = $wmi.ServerInstances['MSSQLSERVER'].ServerProtocols['Tcp']
    $tcp.IsEnabled = $true  
    $tcp.Alter()  

    # You need to restart SQL Server for the change to persist
    # -Force takes care of any dependent services, like SQL Agent.
    # Note: if the instance is named, replace MSSQLSERVER with MSSQL$ followed by
    # the name of the instance (e.g. MSSQL$MYINSTANCE)

    Restart-Service -Name MSSQLSERVER -Force
    ```

## How to enable the TCP protocol when connected to the console not using SQLPS.

1. Open a command prompt and type:

    ```console
    C:\> PowerShell.exe
    ```

2. At the PowerShell command prompt, type:

    ```powershell
    # Get access to SqlWmiManagement DLL on the machine with SQL
    # we are on, which is where SQL Server was installed.
    # Note: this is installed in the GAC by SQL Server Setup.

    [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName('Microsoft.SqlServer.SqlWmiManagement')

    # Instantiate a ManagedComputer object which exposes primitives to control the
    # installation of SQL Server on this machine.

    $wmi = New-Object 'Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Wmi.ManagedComputer' localhost

    # Enable the TCP protocol on the default instance. If the instance is named, 
    # replace MSSQLSERVER with the instance name in the following line.

    $tcp = $wmi.ServerInstances['MSSQLSERVER'].ServerProtocols['Tcp']
    $tcp.IsEnabled = $true  
    $tcp.Alter()  

    # You need to restart SQL Server for the change to persist
    # -Force takes care of any dependent services, like SQL Agent.
    # Note: if the instance is named, replace MSSQLSERVER with MSSQL$ followed by
    # the name of the instance (e.g. MSSQL$MYINSTANCE)

    Restart-Service -Name MSSQLSERVER -Force
    ```
