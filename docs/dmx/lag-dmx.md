# Lag (DMX)
[!INCLUDE[ssas](../includes/applies-to-version/ssas.md)]

  Returns the time slice between the date of the current case and the last date of the training set.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Lag()  
```  
  
## Return Type  
 A scalar value of the type integer.  
  
## Remarks  
 If the **Lag** function is used on a model where the KEY TIME column is located within a nested table, the function must be located within the sub-select of the statement.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example returns cases that fall within the last 12 months of the data that was used to train the model.  
  
```  
SELECT * FROM [Forecasting].CASES  
WHERE Lag() < 12  
```
