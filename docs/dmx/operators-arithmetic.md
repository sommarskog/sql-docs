# Operators - Arithmetic
[!INCLUDE[ssas](../includes/applies-to-version/ssas.md)]

  You can use arithmetic operators in Data Mining Extensions (DMX) for arithmetic computations in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
  
 The following table identifies the arithmetic operators that DMX supports.  
  
|Operator|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|[+ &#40;Add&#41; &#40;DMX&#41;](../dmx/add-dmx.md)|Adds two numbers together.|  
|[- &#40;Subtract&#41; &#40;DMX&#41;](../dmx/subtract-dmx.md)|Subtracts one number from another number.|  
|[&#42; &#40;Multiply&#41; &#40;DMX&#41;](../dmx/multiply-dmx.md)|Multiplies one number by another number.|  
|[&#40;Divide&#41; &#40;DMX&#41;](../dmx/divide-dmx.md)|Divides one number by another number.|  
  
 The following rules determine the order of precedence for arithmetic operators in a DMX expression:  
  
-   When there is more than one arithmetic operator in an expression, multiplication and division are calculated first, followed by subtraction and addition.  
  
-   When all the arithmetic operators in an expression have the same level of precedence, the order of execution is left to right.  
  
-   Expressions that are within parentheses take precedence over all other operations.
