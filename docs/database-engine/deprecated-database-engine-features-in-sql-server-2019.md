# Deprecated database engine features in SQL Server 2019 (15.x)

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver2019](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

[!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] does not deprecate any features beyond those deprecated in prior releases:

- [[!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)]](deprecated-database-engine-features-in-sql-server-2017.md)
- [[!INCLUDE [sssql16-md](../includes/sssql16-md.md)]](deprecated-database-engine-features-in-sql-server-2016.md)

## Deprecation guidelines

When a feature is marked deprecated, it means:

- The feature is in maintenance mode only. No new changes will be done, including those related to addressing inter-operability with new features.
- We strive not to remove a deprecated feature from future releases to make upgrades easier. However, under rare situations, we may choose to permanently discontinue (remove) the feature from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] if it limits future innovations.
- For new development work, do not use deprecated features. For existing applications, plan to modify applications that currently use these features as soon as possible.

You can monitor the use of deprecated features by using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Deprecated Features Object performance counter, or the `deprecation_announcement`  and `deprecation_final_support` extended events. For more information, see [Use SQL Server Objects](../relational-databases/performance-monitor/use-sql-server-objects.md).

## Query deprecated features

The values of these counters are also available by executing the following statement:

[!INCLUDE [deprecated-os-performance-counters](../includes/deprecated-os-performance-counters.md)]
