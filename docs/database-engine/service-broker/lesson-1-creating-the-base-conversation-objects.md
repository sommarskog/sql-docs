# Lesson 1: Creating the Base Conversation Objects

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

In this lesson, you will learn to build all the objects that enable a database to support a conversation in the database.

## Procedures

### Enable Service Broker and switch to the AdventureWorks2008R2 database

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Service Broker AdventureWorks2008R2](../../includes/service-broker-adventureworks-2008-r2.md)]

- Copy and paste the following code into a Query Editor window. Then, run it to ensure that Service Broker is enabled in the AdventureWorks2008R2 database, and switch context to the database.

    ```sql
       USE master;
       GO
       ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2008R2
             SET ENABLE_BROKER;
       GO
       USE AdventureWorks2008R2;
        GO
    ```

### Create the message types

- Copy and paste the following code into a Query Editor window. Then, run it to create the message types for the conversation. Because Service Broker objects are often referenced across multiple instances of the Database Engine, most Service Broker objects are given names in a URI format. This help ensure that they are unique across multiple computers. Both of these message types specify that Service Broker will only validate that the messages are well-formed XML documents, and that it will not validate the XML against a specific schema.

    ```sql
        CREATE MESSAGE TYPE
               [//AWDB/InternalAct/RequestMessage]
               VALIDATION = WELL_FORMED_XML;
        CREATE MESSAGE TYPE
               [//AWDB/InternalAct/ReplyMessage]
               VALIDATION = WELL_FORMED_XML;
        GO
    ```

### Create the contract

- Copy and paste the following code into a Query Editor window. Then, run it to create the contract for the conversation. The contract specifies that conversations that use it must send messages of the **//AWDB/InternalAct/RequestMessage** type from the initiator to the target, and messages of the **//AWDB/InternalAct/ReplyMessage** type from the target to the initiator.

    ```sql
        CREATE CONTRACT [//AWDB/InternalAct/SampleContract]
              ([//AWDB/InternalAct/RequestMessage]
               SENT BY INITIATOR,
               [//AWDB/InternalAct/ReplyMessage]
               SENT BY TARGET
              );
        GO
    ```

### Create the target queue and service

- Copy and paste the following code into a Query Editor window. Then, run it to create the queue and service that is used for the target. Because queues are referenced from the same database in a manner similar to tables and views, queue names are formatted like table or view names. The CREATE SERVICE statement associates the service with the **TargetQueueIntAct**. Therefore, all messages that are sent to the service will be received into the **TargetQueueIntAct**. The CREATE SERVICE also specifies that only conversations that use the **//AWDB/InternalAct/SampleContract** created earlier can use the service as a target service.

    ```sql
        CREATE QUEUE TargetQueueIntAct;

        CREATE SERVICE
               [//AWDB/InternalAct/TargetService]
               ON QUEUE TargetQueueIntAct
                  ([//AWDB/InternalAct/SampleContract]);
        GO
    ```

### Create the initiator queue and service

- Copy and paste the following code into a Query Editor window. Then, run it to create the queue and service that is used for the initiator. Because no contract name is specified, no other services can use this service as a target service.

    ```sql
        CREATE QUEUE InitiatorQueueIntAct;

        CREATE SERVICE
               [//AWDB/InternalAct/InitiatorService]
               ON QUEUE InitiatorQueueIntAct;
        GO
    ```

## Next Steps

You have successfully configured [!INCLUDE [sssampledbobject-md](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] to support a conversation between the **//AWDB/InternalAct/InitiatorService** and the **//AWDB/InternalAct/TargetService**. Next, you will create a stored procedure to support internal activation on the target queue. For more information, see [Lesson 2: Creating an Internal Activation Procedure](lesson-2-creating-an-internal-activation-procedure.md).
