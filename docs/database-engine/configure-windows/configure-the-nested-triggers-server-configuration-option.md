# Configure the nested triggers (server configuration option)
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  This topic describes how to configure the **nested triggers** server configuration option in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. The **nested triggers** option controls whether an AFTER trigger can cascade. That is, perform an action that initiates another trigger, which initiates another trigger, and so on. When **nested triggers** is set to 0, AFTER triggers cannot cascade. When **nested triggers** is set to 1 (the default), AFTER triggers can cascade to as many as 32 levels. INSTEAD OF triggers can be nested regardless of the setting of this option.

 Execute permissions on **sp_configure** with no parameters or with only the first parameter are granted to all users by default. To execute **sp_configure** with both parameters to change a configuration option or to run the RECONFIGURE statement, a user must be granted the ALTER SETTINGS server-level permission. The ALTER SETTINGS permission is implicitly held by the **sysadmin** and **serveradmin** fixed server roles.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To configure the nested triggers option  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, right-click a server, and then select **Properties**.  
  
2.  On the **Advanced** page, set the **Allow Triggers to Fire Others** option to **True** (the default) or **False**.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To configure the nested triggers option  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**. This example shows how to use [sp_configure](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql.md) to set the value of the `nested triggers` option to `0`.  
  
```sql  
USE AdventureWorks2022;  
GO  
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;  
GO  
RECONFIGURE ;  
GO  
EXEC sp_configure 'nested triggers', 0 ;  
GO  
RECONFIGURE;  
GO  
  
```

##  <a name="FollowUp"></a> Follow Up: After you configure the nested triggers option  
 The setting takes effect immediately without restarting the server.
