# Start, stop, pause, resume, and restart SQL Server services

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]

This article describes how to start, stop, pause, resume, or restart the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)], the SQL Server Agent, or the SQL Server Browser service on Windows by using SQL Server Configuration Manager, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), **net** commands from a command prompt, Transact-SQL, or PowerShell.

For [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux, see [Start, stop, and restart SQL Server services on Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-start-stop-restart-sql-server-services.md).

## Identify the service

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components are executable programs that run as Windows services. Windows services can run without displaying any activity on the computer screen and without user interaction on the command line.

### Database Engine service

The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] service can be the default instance (limit one per computer) or can be one of many named instances on the computer. Use [**SQL Server Configuration Manager**](../../relational-databases/sql-server-configuration-manager.md) to find out which instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] are installed on the computer. The default instance (if you install it) is listed as **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)**. Named instances (if you install them) are listed as **SQL Server (<instance_name>)**. By default, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] is installed as **SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)**.

### SQL Server Agent service

The SQL Server Agent service executes scheduled administrative tasks, which are called jobs and alerts. For more information, see [SQL Server Agent](../../ssms/agent/sql-server-agent.md). SQL Server Agent isn't available in every edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For a list of features that are supported by the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2022](../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022.md).

### SQL Server Browser service

The SQL Server Browser service listens for incoming requests for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resources and provides clients information about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instances installed on the computer. A single instance of the SQL Server Browser service is used by all instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installed on the computer.

### Additional Information

- If you pause the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] service, users who are already connected can continue to work until their connections are broken, but new users can't connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]. Use **Pause** when you want to wait for users to complete their work before you stop the service, which lets them complete transactions that are in progress. **Resume** allows the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] to accept new connections again. The SQL Server Agent service can't be paused or resumed.

- The SQL Server Configuration Manager and SSMS display the current status of services by using the following icons.

| | SQL Server Configuration Manager | SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Started** | A green arrow on the icon next to the service name | A white arrow on a green circle icon next to the service name |
| **Stopped** | A red square on the icon next to the service name | A white square on a red circle icon next to the service name |
| **Paused** | Two vertical blue lines on the icon next to the service name | Two vertical white lines on a blue circle icon next to the service name |
| **Restarting** | A red square indicates that the service stopped, and then a green arrow indicates that the service started successfully | None |

- You won't have access to all possible options when using SQL Server Configuration Manager or SSMS, depending on the state of the service. For example, if the service is already started, **Start** is unavailable.

- When running on a cluster, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] service is best managed by using Cluster Administrator.

### Permissions

By default, only members of the local administrator group can start, stop, pause, resume, or restart a service. To grant non-administrators the ability to manage services, see [How to grant users rights to manage services in Windows Server 2003](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/325349). (The process is similar on other versions of Windows Server.)

Stopping the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] by using the Transact-SQL `SHUTDOWN` command requires membership in the **sysadmin** or **serveradmin** fixed server roles, and isn't transferable.

## SQL Server Configuration Manager

### Start SQL Server Configuration Manager

From the **Start** menu, select **All Programs > Microsoft SQL Server > Configuration Tools > SQL Server Configuration Manager**.

The SQL Server Configuration Manager is a snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console program, and it may not appear as an application in some versions of Windows. For more information, see [SQL Server Configuration Manager](../../relational-databases/sql-server-configuration-manager.md).

## <a id="PowerShellProcedure"></a> PowerShell

### Start and stop Database Engine services

1. At a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PowerShell command prompt, by executing the following command. Replace `computername` with the name of your computer.

   ```powershell
   # Get a reference to the ManagedComputer class.
   CD SQLSERVER:\SQL\computername
   $Wmi = (get-item .).ManagedComputer
   ```

1. Identify the service that you want to stop or start. Pick one of the following lines. Replace `instancename` with the name of the named instance.

   - To get a reference to the default instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].

     ```powershell
     $DfltInstance = $Wmi.Services['MSSQLSERVER']
     ```

   - To get a reference to a named instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].

     ```powershell
     $DfltInstance = $Wmi.Services['MSSQL$instancename']
      ```

   - To get a reference to the SQL Server Agent service on the default instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].

     ```powershell
     $DfltInstance = $Wmi.Services['SQLSERVERAGENT']
     ```

   - To get a reference to the SQL Server Agent service on a named instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].

     ```powershell
     $DfltInstance = $Wmi.Services['SQLAGENT$instancename']
     ```

   - To get a reference to the SQL Server Browser service.

     ```powershell
     $DfltInstance = $Wmi.Services['SQLBROWSER']
     ```

1. Complete the example to start and then stop the selected service.

   ```powershell
   # Display the state of the service.
   $DfltInstance
   # Start the service.
   $DfltInstance.Start();
   # Wait until the service has time to start.
   # Refresh the cache.
   $DfltInstance.Refresh();
   # Display the state of the service.
   $DfltInstance
   # Stop the service.
   $DfltInstance.Stop();
   # Wait until the service has time to stop.
   # Refresh the cache.
   $DfltInstance.Refresh();
   # Display the state of the service.
   $DfltInstance
   ```

## Check and enable disabled instances

To determine whether a SQL Server service instance is disabled, follow these steps:

1. Identify the service that you're trying to check by using the information in the [Identify the Service](start-stop-pause-resume-restart-sql-server-services.md) section.
1. In [SQL Server Configuration Manager](../../relational-databases/sql-server-configuration-manager.md), select **SQL Server Services** and then locate the service you're interested in.
1. If the value of the **Start Mode** column is set to **Other (Boot, System, Disabled or Unknown)**, it typically means the corresponding service is disabled. To enable the service, follow these steps:

   1. In the Name column, right-click on the corresponding service and then switch to **Service** tab in the ***\<Service name\>* Properties** window.

   1. Review the value in the **Start Mode** column and verify that it's set to **Disabled**.

   1. Change the value to either **Manual** or **Automatic** per your requirements. For more information, see [Configure Server Startup Options (SQL Server Configuration Manager)](scm-services-configure-server-startup-options.md).

## <a id="ServiceController"></a> Use the ServiceController class

You can use the `ServiceController` class to programmatically control the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service, or any other Windows service. For an example using C#, see [ServiceController Class](/dotnet/api/system.serviceprocess.servicecontroller).

## Troubleshoot service startup issues

When you attempt to start [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services, they might not start if there is a configuration problem. You can review the service specific logs to identify the problem and resolve it. Detailed troubleshooting steps and resolution for specific issues are available in the following articles:

- [SQL Server startup errors](/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/startup-shutdown/sql-server-startup-errors)
- [SQL Server Agent Service fail to start](/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/startup-shutdown/agent-service-fails-start-stand-alone-server)
- [SQL Server agent crashes when you try to start it](/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/startup-shutdown/sql-server-agent-crashes-upon-start)
