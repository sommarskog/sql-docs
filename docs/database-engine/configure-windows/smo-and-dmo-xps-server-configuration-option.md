# SMO and DMO XPs (server configuration option)
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  Use the SMO and DMO XPs option to enable [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Object (SMO) extended stored procedures on this server.  
  
 Note than beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], DMO has been removed from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 The possible values are described in the following table:  
  
|Value|Meaning|  
|-----------|-------------|  
|0|SMO XPs are not available.|  
|1|SMO XPs are available. This is the default.|  
  
 The setting takes effect immediately.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example enables SMO extended stored procedures.  
  
```  
sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;  
GO  
RECONFIGURE;  
GO  
sp_configure 'SMO and DMO XPs', 1;  
GO  
RECONFIGURE  
GO  
```
