# PH timeout (server configuration option)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

The full-text protocol handler (PH) is hosted in the filter daemon host, and is used to fetch from SQL Server the data to be full-text indexed.

Use the **PH timeout** option to specify the time, in seconds, that the full-text protocol handler should wait to connect to a database before timing out. The default value is 60 seconds. Increase the **PH timeout** value when connection attempts are timing out due to temporary network issues.

For more information about full-text search components, see [Full-Text Search](../../relational-databases/search/full-text-search.md).

## Remarks

When attempting to fetch a data row, if the protocol handler can't connect to SQL Server within the specified time, it reports a time-out error for that row. The full-text gatherer will retry the row later. For more information about the full-text gatherer, see [Populate Full-Text Indexes](../../relational-databases/search/populate-full-text-indexes.md).
