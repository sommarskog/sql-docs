# remote admin connections (server configuration option)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides a dedicated administrator connection (DAC). You can use the DAC to execute diagnostic functions or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements, or to troubleshoot problems on the server, even when the server is locked or running in an abnormal state and not responding to a [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] connection.

By default, the DAC is only available from a client application directly on the server. To enable client applications on remote computers to use the DAC, use the **remote admin connections** option of `sp_configure`.

By default, the DAC only listens on the loop-back IP address (127.0.0.1), port 1434. If TCP port 1434 isn't available, a TCP port is dynamically assigned when the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] starts up. When more than one instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed on a computer, check the error log for the TCP port number.

The following table lists the possible values for the remote admin connections option.

|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|
|0|Only local connections are allowed by using the DAC.|
|1|Remote connections are allowed by using the DAC.|

## Example

The following example enables the DAC from a remote computer:

```sql
EXEC sp_configure 'remote admin connections', 1;
GO
RECONFIGURE;
GO
```
