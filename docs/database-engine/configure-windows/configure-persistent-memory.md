# Configure persistent memory (PMEM) for SQL Server on Windows

This article describes how to configure the persistent memory (PMEM) for [!INCLUDE[sqlv14](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and above on Windows.

## Overview

[!INCLUDE[sqlv15](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] has several in-memory database features that rely on persistent memory. This document covers the steps required to configure persistent memory for SQL Server on Windows.

> [!NOTE]
> The term _enlightenment_ was introduced to convey the concept of working with a persistent memory aware file system. Direct access (DAX) extensions to the NTFS file system provide the ability to memory map files from kernel space to user space. When a file is memory mapped into user space the application can issue load/store instructions directly to the memory mapped file, bypassing the kernel I/O stack completely. This is considered an "enlightened" file access method. As of Windows Server 2022, this _enlightenment_ functionality is available on both Windows and Linux platforms.

## Configure the devices

### Create namespaces for PMEM devices

In Windows, use the `ipmctl` utility to configure the PMEM disks (referred to as namespaces in Linux). You can find Intel® Optane™ specific instructions [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/qsg-part3-windows-provisioning-with-optane-pmem.html). Details on supported PMEM hardware on different Windows versions are at [Understand and deploy persistent memory](/azure-stack/hci/concepts/deploy-persistent-memory#supported-hardware). PMEM disks should be interleaved across PMEM NVDIMMs and can provide different types of user-space access to memory regions on the device. For more information on interleaved sets in Windows, see [Understand and deploy persistent memory](/azure-stack/hci/concepts/deploy-persistent-memory#understand-interleaved-sets).

## PMEM disks

### Use PowerShell to examine PMEM disks

```powershell
#Get information about all physical disks
Get-PhysicalDisk

#Review logical configuration of PMEM disks
Get-PmemDisk

#Get information about PMEM devices
Get-PmemPhysicalDevice

#Get information about unused PMEM regions
Get-PmemUnusedRegion
```

### BTT and DAX

By default, `New-PmemDisk` will use the desired `FSDax` mode. Atomicity is set to the default of `None` rather than `BlockTranslationTable`. From a support perspective, BTT must be enabled for the transaction log, to mimic required sector mode semantics. Although use of [BTT](/azure-stack/hci/concepts/deploy-persistent-memory#block-translation-table) with NTFS is generally recommended, BTT is not recommended when using large pages, such as required for [DAX](/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/persistent-memory-direct-access#dax-and-block-translation-table-btt).

```powershell
Get-PmemUnusedRegion | New-PmemDisk -Atomicity None
```

### Formatting the NTFS volume(s)

```powershell

#Initialize PMEM Disk(s)
Get-PmemDisk | Initialize-Disk -PartitionStyle GPT

#Create New Partition(s) and Format the Volume(s) with DAX Mode
Get-PmemDisk[0] | `
New-Partition `
    -UseMaximumSize `
    -AssignDriveLetter `
    -Offset 2097152 `
    -Alignment 2097152 | `
Format-Volume `
    -FileSystem NTFS `
    -IsDAX:$True `
    -AllocationUnitSize 2097152
```
## File alignment and offset

### Check partition offset(s)

```powershell
Get-Partition | Select-Object DiskNumber, DriveLetter, IsDAX, Offset, Size, PartitionNumber | fl
```

Check the file alignment of a particular file using `fsutil`. Our file size must be a modulo of 2 MB.

```bash
fsutil dax queryFileAlignment A:\AdventureWorks2022_A.mdf
```

## Replacing PMEM

### Reprovision PMEM disks

Whenever a PMEM module is replaced, it needs to be reprovisioned.

> [!NOTE]
> Removing a PMEM disk will result in the loss of data on that disk.

```powershell
# Remove all PMEM disks
Get-PmemDisk | Remove-PmemDisk -Confirm:$false
```
### Erase PMEM modules

To permanently erase data from PMEM modules, use the `Initialize-PmemPhysicalDevice` PowerShell cmdlet.

```powershell
# Reinitialize all PMEM disks
Get-PmemPhysicalDevice | Initialize-PmemPhysicalDevice -Confirm:$false
```
