# xp_cmdshell (server configuration option)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This article describes how to enable the `xp_cmdshell` SQL Server configuration option. This option allows system administrators to control whether the [xp_cmdshell extended stored procedure](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/xp-cmdshell-transact-sql.md) can be executed on a system. By default, the `xp_cmdshell` option is disabled on new installations.

Before enabling this option, it's important to consider the potential security implications.

- Newly developed code shouldn't use the `xp_cmdshell` stored procedure, and generally it should be left disabled.
- Some legacy applications require `xp_cmdshell` to be enabled. If they can't be modified to avoid the use of this stored procedure, you can enable it as described below.

> [!NOTE]  
> If `xp_cmdshell` must be used, as a security best practice it is recommended to only enable it for the duration of the actual task that requires it. Using `xp_cmdshell` can trigger security audit tools.

If you need to enable `xp_cmdshell`, you can use [Policy-Based Management](../../relational-databases/policy-based-management/administer-servers-by-using-policy-based-management.md) or run the `sp_configure` system stored procedure as shown in the following code example:

``` sql
-- To allow advanced options to be changed.
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
GO

-- To update the currently configured value for advanced options.
RECONFIGURE;
GO

-- To enable the feature.
EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
GO

-- To update the currently configured value for this feature.
RECONFIGURE;
GO

-- To set "show advanced options" back to false
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 0;
GO

-- To update the currently configured value for advanced options.
RECONFIGURE;
GO
```
