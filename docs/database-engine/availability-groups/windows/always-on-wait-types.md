# Identify waits associated with availability groups
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  When troubleshooting Always On Availability Groups latency, wait statistics can be monitored for accumulation using the availability groups-specific wait types in the dynamic management view (DMV) [sys.dm_os_wait_stats &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](~/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-wait-stats-transact-sql.md).  
  
 For general information on using wait statistics, see [SQL Server 2005 Waits and Queues](/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2005/administrator/cc966413(v=technet.10)). That document was written for SQL Server 2005, but its information can be applied to later SQL Server versions.  
  
## Query for availability groups wait types  
 Use the T-SQL query below to retrieve all wait statistics with the availability groups wait types:  
  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats   
WHERE wait_type LIKE '%hadr%'  
ORDER BY wait_time_ms DESC  
```  
  
 To monitor the wait statistics by capturing extended events, use the following T-SQL command.  
  
```sql
CREATE EVENT SESSION [alwayson] ON SERVER   
ADD EVENT sqlos.wait_info(  
    WHERE ([wait_type]=(758) OR [wait_type]=(776) OR [wait_type]=(853) OR [wait_type]=(833)))  
WITH (MAX_MEMORY=4096 KB,EVENT_RETENTION_MODE=ALLOW_SINGLE_EVENT_LOSS,MAX_DISPATCH_LATENCY=30 SECONDS,  
MAX_EVENT_SIZE=0 KB,MEMORY_PARTITION_MODE=NONE,TRACK_CAUSALITY=OFF,STARTUP_STATE=OFF)  
GO  
```  
  
 You can view the key-value mapping of the wait type by running the following query:  
  
```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_xe_map_values   
WHERE name='wait_types' AND map_value LIKE '%hadr%'   
ORDER BY map_key ASC  
```
