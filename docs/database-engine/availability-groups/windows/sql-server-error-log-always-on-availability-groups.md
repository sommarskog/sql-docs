# SQL Server error log (Always On Availability Groups)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  The SQL Server error log reports events affecting Always On Availability Groups, such as:  
  
-   Communication with the Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster    
-   State transitions of availability replicas    
-   State transitions of availability databases    
-   Connectivity state of availability databases between primary and secondary replicas    
-   Statuses of the availability group endpoints    
-   Statuses of the availability group listeners    
-   Lease status between the SQL Server resource DLL (running in the WSFC cluster) and the SQL Server instance (for more information, see [How It Works: SQL Server Always On lease timeout](/archive/blogs/psssql/how-it-works-sql-server-alwayson-lease-timeout))    
-   Error events in the availability group  

The following symptoms should lead to review of the SQL Server error log:  

-   Cannot access availability databases    
-   Unexpected availability group failover    
-   Availability group in the Resolving state unexpectedly    
-   Availability group in an indeterminate state
