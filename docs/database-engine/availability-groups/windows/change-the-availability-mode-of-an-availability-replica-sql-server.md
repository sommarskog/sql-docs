# Change availability mode of a replica within an Always On availability group
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  This topic describes how to change the availability mode of an availability replica in an Always On availability group in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)], or PowerShell. The availability mode is a replica property that controls the whether the replica commits asynchronously or synchronously. *Asynchronous-commit mode* maximizes performance at the expense of high availability and supports only forced manual failover (with possible data loss), typically called *forced failover*. *Synchronous-commit mode* emphasizes high availability over performance and, once the secondary replica is synchronized, supports manual failover and, optionally, automatic failover.  
    
##  <a name="Prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites  
  
You must be connected to the server instance that hosts the primary replica.  
  

##  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Requires ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP permission on the availability group, CONTROL AVAILABILITY GROUP permission, ALTER ANY AVAILABILITY GROUP permission, or CONTROL SERVER permission.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
 **To change the availability mode of an availability group**  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, connect to the server instance that hosts the primary replica, and expand the server tree.  
  
2.  Expand the **Always On High Availability** node and the **Availability Groups** node.  
  
3.  Click the availability group whose replica you want to change.  
  
4.  Right-click the replica, and click **Properties**.  
  
5.  In the **Availability Replica Properties** dialog box, use the **Availability mode** drop list to change the availability mode of this replica.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
 **To change the availability mode of an availability group**  
  
1.  Connect to the server instance that hosts the primary replica.  
  
2.  Use the [ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP](../../../t-sql/statements/alter-availability-group-transact-sql.md) statement, as the following example:  
  
     ```sql
     ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [<availability_group_name>] MODIFY REPLICA ON '*server_name*'  
     WITH ( AVAILABILITY_MODE = ASYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT)
	 
     ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [<availability_group_name>] MODIFY REPLICA ON '*server_name*'  
     WITH ( FAILOVER_MODE = MANUAL );  
     ```
     
     Where *group_name* is the name of the availability group and *server_name* is the name of the server instance that hosts the replica to be modified.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > `FAILOVER_MODE = AUTOMATIC` is supported only if you also specify `AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT`.  
  
     The following example, entered on the primary replica of the `AccountsAG` availability group, changes the availability and failover modes to synchronous commit and automatic failover, respectively, for the replica hosted by the `INSTANCE09` server instance.  
  
    ```sql
    ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP AccountsAG MODIFY REPLICA ON 'INSTANCE09'  
       WITH (AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT);  
    ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP AccountsAG MODIFY REPLICA ON 'INSTANCE09'  
       WITH (FAILOVER_MODE = AUTOMATIC);  
    ```  
  
##  <a name="PowerShellProcedure"></a> Using PowerShell  
 **To change the availability mode of an availability group**  
  
1.  Change directory (**cd**) to the server instance that hosts the primary replica.  
  
2.  Use the **Set-SqlAvailabilityReplica** cmdlet with the **AvailabilityMode** parameter and, optionally, the **FailoverMode** parameter.  
  
     For example, the following command modifies the replica `MyReplica` in the availability group `MyAg` to use synchronous-commit availability mode and to support automatic failover.  
  
    ```powershell  
    Set-SqlAvailabilityReplica -AvailabilityMode "SynchronousCommit" -FailoverMode "Automatic" `   
    -Path SQLSERVER:\Sql\PrimaryServer\InstanceName\AvailabilityGroups\MyAg\AvailabilityReplicas\MyReplica  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > To view the syntax of a cmdlet, use the **Get-Help** cmdlet in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PowerShell environment. For more information, see [Get Help SQL Server PowerShell](../../../powershell/sql-server-powershell.md).
