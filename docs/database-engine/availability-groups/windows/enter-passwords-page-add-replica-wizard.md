# Enter Passwords Page (Add Replica Wizard) for Always On availability groups
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  This help topic describes the options of the **Enter Passwords** page. This topic applies to the [!INCLUDE[ssAoAddRepWiz](../../../includes/ssaoaddrepwiz-md.md)] of [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 If the replicas that you selected on the **Specify Replicas** page contain databases that have a database master key, the Enter Passwords page appears.  
  
## Enter Passwords Options  
 The **User databases on this instance of SQL Server** grid lists every local user database. The columns are as follows:  
  
 **Name**  
 Displays the name of a local user database.  
  
 **Size**  
 Displays the database size, if the size is available to the wizard.  
  
 **Status**  
 Indicates **Password required** for databases that have a database master key. After you enter the passwords for the database master keys in the **Passwords** column, click **Refresh**. If you entered the passwords correctly, the **Status** column indicates **Password entered**.  
  
 If the database doesn't have a database master key, the **Status** column indicates **Password not required**.  
  
 **Password**  
 If the **Status** column indicates **Password required**, enter the password for the database master key.  
  
 **Refresh**  
 Click to refresh the grid. This is useful after you enter required passwords.
