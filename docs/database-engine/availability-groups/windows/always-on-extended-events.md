# Configure Extended Events for availability groups

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

SQL Server defines Extended Events that are specific to availability groups. You can monitor these Extended Events in a session to help with root-cause diagnosis when you troubleshoot an availability group. You can view the availability group Extended Events using the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_xe_objects WHERE name LIKE '%hadr%';
```

## <a id="BKMK_alwayson_health"></a> The alwayson_health session

The `alwayson_health` Extended Events session is created automatically when you create the availability group, and captures a subset of the availability group related events. This session is preconfigured as a useful and convenient tool to help you get started quickly while troubleshooting an availability group. The Create Availability Group Wizard automatically starts the session on every participating availability replica configured in the wizard.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you did not create the availability group using the **New Availability Group Wizard**, the `alwayson_health` session may not be automatically started. If the session is not started, it cannot capture event data when an unexpected issue occurs. You should manually start the session and configure the session to start automatically by configuring the session properties.

To view the definition of the `alwayson_health` session:

1. In the **Object Explorer**, expand **Management**, **Extended Events**, and then **Sessions**.

1. Right-click **Alwayson_health**, then point to **Script Session as**, then point to **CREATE To**, and then select **New Query Editor Window**.

## <a id="BKMK_Debugging"></a> Extended Events for debugging

In addition to the Extended Events covered by the Alwayson_health session, SQL Server defines an extensive set of debug events for availability groups. To harness these additional Extended Events in a session, follow the procedures below:

1. In the **Object Explorer**, expand **Management**, **Extended Events**, and then **Sessions**.

1. Right-click **Sessions** and select **New Session**. Or, right-click **Alwayson_health** and select **Properties**.

1. In the **Select a page** pane, select **Events**.

1. In the event library, in the **Category** column, select **alwayson** and clear all other categories.

1. In the **Channel** column, select **Debug**. All the availability group related events that aren't already selected are now shown in the event library.

1. Highlight an event in the event library, then select the **>** button to select it for the session.

1. When finished with the session, select **OK** to close it. Make sure that the session is started so that it captures the events that you selected.

## <a id="BKMK_availability_replica_state_change"></a> availability_replica_state_change

Occurs when the state of an availability replica has changed. The creation of an availability group or joining an availability replica can trigger this event. It is useful for the diagnostics of failed automatic failover. It can also be used to trace the failover steps.

GO
```

## <a id="BKMK_availability_group_lease_expired"></a> availability_group_lease_expired

 Occurs when the cluster and availability group has a connectivity issue and the lease is expired. This event indicates that connectivity between the availability group and the underlying WSFC cluster is broken. If the connectivity issue occurs on the primary replica, the event may cause an automatic failover or cause the availability group to be offline.

```

## <a id="BKMK_availability_replica_automatic_failover_validation"></a> availability_replica_automatic_failover_validation

Occurs when the automatic failover validates the readiness of an availability replica as a primary replica, and it shows whether the target availability replica is ready to be the new primary replica. For example, the failover validation returns false when not all databases are synchronized or not joined. This event is design to provide a failure point during failovers. This information is of interest to the database administrator especially for automatic failovers because an automatic failover is an unattended operation. The database administrator can review the event to see why an automatic failover failed.
