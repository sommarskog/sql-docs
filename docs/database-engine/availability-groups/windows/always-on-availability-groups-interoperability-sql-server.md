# Always On availability groups: interoperability (SQL Server)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This topic documents interoperability of [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] with other [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features.

## <a name="Interop"></a> Features that Interoperate with Always On Availability Groups

The following table lists [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features that interoperate with [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)]. A link in the **More Information** column indicates that interoperability considerations exist for a given feature.

## <a name="restrictions"></a> Features that Interoperate with Always On Availability Groups with Restrictions

The following features interoperate with [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] with specific restrictions. See the linked topics for details.

- Cross-database transactions within the same SQL Server instance require [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] SP2 and Windows Server 2016 or later, with some patching requirements. For more information, see [Cross-Database Transactions and Distributed Transactions for Always On Availability Groups and Database Mirroring &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/transactions-always-on-availability-and-database-mirroring.md)
- Distributed transactions require [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] SP2 and Windows Server 2012 R2 or later, with some patching requirements. For more information, see [Cross-Database Transactions and Distributed Transactions for Always On Availability Groups and Database Mirroring &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/transactions-always-on-availability-and-database-mirroring.md)
- [Query statistics system data collector](../../../relational-databases/data-collection/system-data-collection-set-reports.md#Query) cannot reliably run in an environment with non-readable secondaries. To use query statistics system data collector, set all secondary availability group replicas to allow [read-access](configure-read-only-access-on-an-availability-replica-sql-server.md). 

## <a name="NoInterop"></a> Features that Do Not Interoperate with Always On Availability Groups

[!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] does not interoperate with the following features:

- Database mirroring. For more information, see [Cross-Database Transactions and Distributed Transactions for Always On Availability Groups and Database Mirroring &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/transactions-always-on-availability-and-database-mirroring.md).
