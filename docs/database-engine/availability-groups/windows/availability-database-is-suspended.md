# Availability database is suspended for an availability group
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
    
## Introduction  
  
- **Policy Name**: Availability Database Suspension State
- **Issue**: Availability database is suspended.
- **Category**: **Warning**
- **Facet**: Availability database  
  
## Description  
 This policy checks the state of data movement of the secondary database (also known as a "secondary database replica"). The policy is in an unhealthy state when the data movement is suspended. The policy is otherwise in a healthy state.  
  
## Possible Causes  
 Data synchronization on this availability database might have been suspended because of the following:  
  
-   Due to an error, the system might have suspended data synchronization.  
  
-   The database administrator might have suspended data synchronization for maintenance purposes.  
  
## Possible Solution  
 Resume data synchronization. If the issue persists, check the availability group in the Event log, and then diagnose why the system suspended data movement.
