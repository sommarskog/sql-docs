# Driver and client connectivity support for availability groups

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This article describes considerations for client connectivity to Always On availability groups, including prerequisites, restrictions, and recommendations for client configurations and settings.

## Client connectivity support

The section below provides information about [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] support for client connectivity.

### Driver support

The following table summarizes driver support for [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)]:

|Driver|Multi-subnet failover|Application intent|Read-only routing|Multi-subnet failover: faster single subnet endpoint failover|Multi-subnet failover: named instance resolution for SQL clustered instances|  
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|SQL Native Client 11.0 ODBC|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|  
|SQL Native Client 11.0 OLEDB|No|Yes|Yes|No|No|  
|ADO.NET with .NET Framework 4.0 with connectivity patch <sup>1</sup>|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|  
|ADO.NET with .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 with connectivity patch <sup>2</sup>|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|  
|[Microsoft ODBC Driver 13.1+ for SQL Server](../../../connect/odbc/microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md)|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|[Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.0+ for SQL Server](../../../connect/jdbc/microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server.md)|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|  
|[Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](../../../connect/oledb/oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md) <sup>3</sup>|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|

<sup>1</sup> Download the connectivity patch for ADO .NET with .NET Framework 4.0: [https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2600211](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2600211).

<sup>2</sup> Download the connectivity patch for ADO.NET with .NET Framework 3.5 SP1: [https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2654347](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2654347).

<sup>3</sup> Download Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server: [https://aka.ms/downloadmsoledbsql](../../../connect/oledb/download-oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To connect to an availability group listener, a client must use a TCP connection string.
